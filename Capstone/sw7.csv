"This film revived the Star Wars franchise, it was a very difficult task, but Disney managed to make a cool and fun movie with very good characters, it's a brave film, it kills Han Solo who is an iconic character, he brings up a very good villain Kylo Ren, too bad this film is almost a remake of the first film in the franchise."
I think this Star Wars is good I feel like it is a copy of A New Hope which is why I give it 4mstars but it has amazing visuals a good but reused story and overall just good characters
"This movie feels more and more empty each time I rewatch it. Just a rehash of A New Hope, but with worse characters and an insane number of contrived plot conveniences that the movie doesn't even attempt to explain."
The Phantom Menace was better than this abomination. This movie is completely unoriginal and adds nothing new to the Star Wars universe. J.J Abrams literally copied A New Hope and added better special effects and racially diverse casts
"it could be good if the follow up movies were but they werent and so that movie is bad
too 
as a stand alone it just doesent work"
The best of the new bunch. Familiar story but with new life breathed into it. An excellent return to the franchise.
"This is the start of the death row for Star Wars.
Enter REY! The most impossible poorly written uncool character in the history of Star Wars.
No training, who cares? She is an overnight Yoda-level Force Practitioner. 
Why train for decades like Anakin and Luke when you can just hold a lightsaber and just beat the baddest Sith Lord in town who trained with the Last Grand Master Jedi?
Talk about political agendas, identity politics and pleasing the diversity triggered police. I mean this was beyond obvious! 
But we aint done... lets take the coolest guy in the galaxy and make him a looser drifting pirate that keep using the same clothing for 40 years and leaves a beautiful princess behind for no good reason. Lets take away from him his happy ending that he fought for so bravely... not that in all the books he doesnt become a general and respected leader, lets just toss away all those books and comics written after the movie and just make him the worst.

LETS KILL HAN SOLO! That should set the first of many great deaths of what made the Star Wars Saga the coolest ever!"
"They tried to make it great again before it got destroyed. This movie had so many of us in tears, smiling, waiting for the past to meet the future. Could've been better but it was the best in the franchise we got since Disney took over. JJ did an admirable job."
It's good enough to hang with the prequels great action.
A nostalgic trip to the time of the original trilogy.
Watching this was like watching someone wipe their ass with your childhood toys while patronizing you in a very boring tone for a couple of hours. I was lured back into watching by movie 6 after giving up on SW after prequel 1. This really is the turd in the punchbowl and shatters the whole milieu for me so that even the more meritorious movies in this rotting franchise are impossible to enjoy. Whoever made this can go to hell.
I’m sorry what was this? Rey got way to overpower way to quickly and don’t try to say she “trained with Luke” I wouldn’t call swinging a stick around training and she was just swinging it at a rock not training droid no good teachings from Luke so no I did not like this movie
"its just a copy of episode 4, but somewhat trash, it tries to introduce new characters but they are completely boring, and its just an insult that a base the magnitude of starkiller base was blown up that easy."
Probably my favorite of the series. The last one was a disaster.
"I really think Disney should give George lukas his films back because what Disney did with them was garbage 

Rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting"
"It's basically a remake of A New Hope, but not as good."
The movie was mediocre at best. The flashing lights and pretty colours are top quality though.
A great new start for the Star Wars saga! It captured George Lucas's Star Wars spirit and respected what came before. JJ Abrams is brilliant and did a fantastic job and The Force Awakens is a treat for all Star Wars and new fans. John Williams did a fantastic job with the music as always. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver were fantastic! Rey's hero journey is just as profound as Lukes was!
Wow I went to see this in cinema and it blew me away but the two films following this were alot better in my opinion just played it a bit to safe to begin the sequel trilogy but a good film. All round
who are all these characters .... is this Harry Potter
"For how long it was between the Revenge of the Sith and the release of this movie, it was a decent addition to the saga. However, it wasn't unique at all is more of a modern remake of A New Hope than an actual addition to the Star Wars universe."
"Considering that Ray is a Mary Sue, this film sucks... Along with its mediocre excuse of a Star War sequel franchise."
The force awakens?. More like force destroyed. Trash movie and a tarnish on the entire franchise
This is just the beginning of a horrible trilogy. It only gets worse from here.
Doesn't deserve the praise that the critics gave it. Wasn't original at all. Practically A New Hope but with better special effects.
"It's the remake of episode IV, with excellent action sequences."
A lot of people criticize this movie for being too similar to a new hope and that Rey is a mary sue but I disagree. I wouldn't rewatch this movie but I didn't hate it and I know for a fact people liked this movie
Great Star Wars film! The end fight scene in the snow is one of my favourites out of all the movies!
would of rated it higher if it wasn't like the damn originals and having rey being an utter god
"The Force Awakens introduces us to many new characters, all with promising stories that can flourish into something great. It combines the themes of the past with the creativity of something new to create a beautiful dynamic throughout the movie keeping the audience guessing for what happens next."
"Looked good, but everything else was recycled from the originals ..."
Does plot even matter in these movies?
Great return to the franchise
Great world building and a reintroduction to the universe with a new group of characters.
its just a new hope again but with a mary sue and incoherences
A good movie to start of a trilogy with new characters to enjoy and old characters to remember. This movie was good and is very enjoyable
Brilliant film! So happy to see this brought to life again.
Great beginning to a trilogy. Looked so promising
"Episode 7 .... Only Disney and his modifications with skinny arguments, with a couple of protagonists who have discussions with linens, seem to be taken from a series of children from Nickelodeon, a villain who starts well but then collapses losing strength and being defeated by two beginners with lightsaber, a hologram of a character that has no comparison with that of Sidiousm who does not awaken ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING of mystery. For me a lazy script, an overly simplistic argument, The film can be told like this: It is to find a plane to find Luke FIN. Wow! Lucas please make the movies again, it only remains for Goofi to appear in the next installment!"
SORRY KIDS BUT THIS FRANCHISE WAS OFFICIALLY OVER WITH AFTER REVENGE OF THE SITH!!!
"An amazing entry to the Skywalker Saga. A lot of heart, tension, laughs and cries"
A new hope 2.0. No new ideas wasted characters and insults your intelligence at times. An ok way to spend 2 hours.
A great start to the new trilogy.
could have been a good start for the trilogy
"Though it has a cohesive plot and interesting characters, it absolutely lacks innovation. This brings nothing new to the franchise. It is still fun and visually stunning."
"This movie is quite good, to me it is the best of the new Star Wars movies. My main problem with the movie is Kylo Ren. He has hissy fits when something doesn't go the way he wanted."
One of the safest and uninspired movies I've ever watched. Disney really screwed up big time.
"The perfect return to a legendary franchise with modern filmmaking, acting, and story building that fits right at nostalgic home."
"I absolutely hated this movie. Carrie Fisher’s life choices of extreme drugs and alcohol just permeated her roll and you could almost imagine Harrison Ford in an early meeting telling Lucas “ok, I’ll do one more but you gotta kill me off in this one”. Ugh. Not the Star Wars I grew up. I’d take Jar Jar over this any day."
"This is totally the best Star Wars movie ever. I loved the comedy and the return of characters, giving nostalgia to all Star Wars diehards. Great storyline introduced and I found a lot interesting about this movie. Rey, Finn, and Poe are all made the best by this movie."
"Man - Star Wars is cool! Episode VII takes place thirty years after the Destruction of the second Death Star, and the fall of Palpatine and the Empire. We're introduced to new and charming characters, as well as truly intimidating ones. Never before has Star Wars looked better, or been so entertaining, as the tension feels heightened. Both sides feel like they have a lot to lose - the First Order feels like it's just starting to gain its power, while the Resistance is barely managing to hold together. The story beats hit hard, specifically with Kylo Ren. Driver and Ridley shine in their roles, with the latter bringing acrobatics and fierce independence that we haven't seen in the franchise before. The action flows smoother, the lightsabers hum louder and it's still satisfying to see Storm Troopers get theirs. Yup! Star Wars will always be cool to me."
Extremely bad. This was the last Star Wars movie I went to the cinema for!
It's good. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎
In all honesty its just a worse version of A New Hope.
Least bad of the final Skywalker trilogy.
Not super original with the plot and I’m still not sure I like the casting or if the writing is just cheesy in the intense scenes. Really great as an experience and should be seen at least once.
"Not too bad. It's at least better than old episodes, which are too  outdated in a modern view. But, it is too similar to episode IV, so yes, there isn't much originality beside some extreme political correctness."
"I like/have liked all the Star Wars movies and I did like this one, though not as well as the first three (IV-VI).  Rogue I was written and produced to answer questions/fill in some gaps between III & IV.  VII is just a rework of IV though VI.  High octane CGI X-Wing vs. Tie Fighters; Rey lives on a desert planet in an obscure position, has The Force 'strong' within her and develops her skills with the force throughout; The map to Luke is hidden in a droid is a major subplot; Han leads another team to destroy a support position that leads to the death of the Super Death Star; etc...  It was entertaining even if most of it was not original and there is too much CGI (CGI is nothing more than more sophisticated Saturday morning cartoons).  Remember the hollywood motto: Keep making sequels until the gross goes down..."
Great to be back at the Star Wars Universe!
"A New Hope clone, albeit a pretty entertaining one"
Good movie trilogy starter
"Destroys the saga. Thanks Disney,  Kathleen Kennedy et. al."
"This was one of the best ways to re-enter the franchise with Rey, Finn, and Poe and old characters this movie has everything"
mary sue who does not add to movie much. Did not appreciate new characters.
"The future was bright and open wide again. They introduced good characters, and reminded you of Star Wars. It was not the most creative film ever made, and missed some opportunities."
Could have been better for all they tried to put into it. Ultimately Bad.
"The reason why I get it 1 and a half is because there was a little that I like. However, it is just a reskinned of a new hope. Also, there is nothing new in this Star Wars. This whole trilogy is a mess. This movie was good but connecting it to the other sequels of this story and what came before doesn't make sense. The whole sequelogy is a fanfic not canon mess. Before starting to make a trilogy that's a sequel to Star Wars should of made a plan that is more story driven then having the two directors have a custody battle and assigning a power that is genderless a gender. It's not what gender or race the main characters are that make Star Wars great, it's the story and the character development that made it great. The whole sequel trilogy is Star Wars in name only and that's all that it is. There is nothing that actual feels like Star Wars in these three movies. Should of plan the sequel trilogy better to make it Star Wars through out."
Let's kill off everyone The audience cares about and replace them with characters we don't. Because DISNEY.
"Repleto de nostalgia, um filme perfeito"
"Great pacing, characters and new ideas sprinkled throughout the film. An engaging watch. Though it borrows some ideas from ot and clone wars but still stands on its on."
"JJ Abrams did it to everyone AGAIN.

Look at the mystery box everyone!  Don't you want to know what's inside?  Aren't you just salivating at the thought of all that already written solutions to all these questions?

A good question, for another time."
Great visuals. Good start of new trilogy. Unfortunately failed on promises.
The originals are better
"When I first saw this movie, I loved it. But I feel as if the rest of the sequel trilogy has made TFA worse. The plot threads either were cast aside or answered in an unsatisfactory manner. I remember seeing this movie in theaters, and I loved all the new characters like Finn and Rey and Kylo Ren. I was so exited to watch them develop. But unfortunately, they barely did over the next two movies and that makes this feel worse. I really liked Rey and Finn’s friendship in this movie and it was tossed aside in TLJ and not as prominent in TROS. My biggest problem with this movie was the lack of originality. Everybody says it’s a copy of ANH — they are all correct. I won’t list all the similarities, but the original Star Wars did it better. When I watched this movie and there was another Death Star (Starkiller Base) I thought to myself “Come on! Another? After the first two Death Stars blew up?” However, I could overlook this and enjoy the movie for what it was. When Finn and Rey fought Kylo Ren in the snow, the first time I saw it I was excited. I thought it was so cool how when Finn was defeated Rey came in and fought Kylo. I thought it was so cool. Now, though, I am irritated. Kylo sliced Finn with his lightsaber in the back and Finn only got a scratch. Rey got Kylo in the face and he only got a scratch. That’s not how lightsabers work! They’re deadly weapons that cut people in half, and the fact that Rey/Finn didn’t hurt themselves with a lightsaber when they had no training is ridiculous. Finn probably should’ve at least been paralyzed from Kylo slicing him but he wasn’t. I have other questions. How was the First Order able to afford to build everything? How did Maz get the lightsaber? Why did the lightsaber give Rey visions? Why did Leia hug Rey instead of Chewie, who she actually knows? Why did Rey beat Kylo with no training? Just because she’s a Palpatine doesn’t give her a pass; just because you’re related to someone who was good with lightsabers doesn’t mean you’ll be. There is also a lot of coincidences in this movie like a force sensitive girl finding the droid with important information and running into a former stormtrooper who happens to have Poe’s jacket, and they happen to escape on the Millennium Falcon, and that happens to be found by none other than Han Solo. I think the problem with sequels, just in general, is that they ruin the happy endings that the series originally had. Anakin killed Palpatine and fulfilled his destiny, and Luke redeemed his father. The rebels won... but now it feels like everything they did was POINTLESS. Whenever I look at something that is Star Wars, I think about how all their hard work was pointless. Almost all of the OT characters die, like Han Solo did in this movie. So why did they make this?... oh, money. I don’t think this movie was bad. It was quite enjoyable. But I couldn’t give it five stars because of the reasons I stated above. The thing is, we want to wonder about what happened to our favorite characters after ROTJ, not see them all die... like Han Solo died in this one :("
"I don't see where the hate was coming from with this movie. It was thrilling, funny, and entertaining.  I could almost ignore the fact that Ray was perfect in every way, and therefore left little room for growth."
"A good jump back into the Star Wars universe after ten years. 'The Force Awakens' brings in new characters with more interesting backstories than the prequel trilogy and doesn't forget about the nostalgia. If you were expecting the writers to develop a new radical plot for our new band of heroes to conquer, then you'll be sorely disappointed. Overall, great cinematography, score, and acting, but lacks in creativity and plausibility."
"This was a disappointment. The is a remake and the same recipe as Episode IV. This time a lone girl on a desert planet with, what a coincidence Force Powers who meets up with a droid who has a secret, that leads to some some ship adventures and fighting Stormtroopers who's appearance has not changed in 30 years or the Tie fighters. Instead of the Empire you have The First Order. Instead of the Rebellion it's the Resistance. A skinny mini-me Darth Vader who looks like a hipster and guess what a bigger Death Star to destroy!!! Sound Familiar?? 1977 Star Wars! Basically Star Wars 2015.0!!"
"Having seen the rest of the mess of a trilogy, I decided to revisit this film, which I enjoyed, although found flawed when it first came out. I conclude that this movie has not aged well even in less than 5 years, and bares the roots of what hurt the overall trilogy. Much has been made of the unoriginality, but it goes deeper than that. First off, this movie is very short. At just 2 hours and 15 minutes long it is the shortest of the last five SW films, and is much closer in length to a film like Spider Man Homecoming than most SW films, let alone films like Infinity War or Endgame. It is unusual to do this when you are planning to in just 3 films try to reintroduce OT character, introduce new characters, create a new overarching threat for the trilogy and supposedly provide closure for the whole episodic SW saga, a feat more analogous to event movies like IW/Endgame than like a random MCU installment. But I think this could've been overcome with the right direction. But instead, JJ seemed to lean into this, with a frenetic pace that didn't allow supposed emotional moments like Finn's admission to Rey to hit and led to weird moments like Leia comforting Rey when Han died though she barely knew Rey and Rey hardly knew Han. A few more scenes of bonding between these characters would've helped this, but instead, events seemed to just go along because they wanted Finn and Rey to be certain characters in future movies (Other examples are Rey volunteering to go on a mission to find Luke in a distant place when she was supposedly committed to waiting for her parents on Jakuu, something TLJ tried to rectify but ROS screwed back up, as well as Finn giving one liners when he has just escaped from his tragic and complex background). Compare this to the moments of slowness and character development such as the bond between Luke and Obi Wan in ANH. Another issue is the forced fan service, with moments like Han finding the Falcon feeling a lot less awesome and more like plot convenience (again to fit the speedy pace) outside of the environment of a packed theater in late 2015. Finally, the biggest issue I'd say is the central conflict of the movie. I said I'd stay away from criticizing the movie's originality and I tried to be ok with the similarities through much of the movie. But on both viewings, one copy bothered me and that was the Starkiller Base. Not only was this unoriginal but it didn't fit within the narrative of the film itself. The Death Star works in ANH because it is introduced from the start, in the opening crawl. TFA however presents itself at the beginning to be about this Resistance, backed by the Republic, being in a race with the First Order to find out about Luke's whereabouts. Then, what is presented as a bigger, badder Death Star is presented without warning, over halfway into (again an already short) movie, killing one of those organizations, the Republic without it having been relevant to the plot at all. The plot that was presented about Luke is resolved randomly at the very end, with no explanation given (R2D2 is just suddenly awake with what they need to find him). Changing the main conflict of the film halfway through is just bad writing, and seems to be done just because of laziness/fan service. It doesn't even work as a surprise, because it's a reused idea in a film where we have already seen reused ideas play out in the same way. This is all too bad, because it detracts from what is a well acted and visually stunning film. In conclusion, I would say TFA fails not just because it is a remake of ANH, but also because it is a poor one."
"I gave half a star because it's not The Rise of Skywalker and 2 stars because it's not The Last Jedi. So many possibilities to make an amazing movie with an amazing story but instead was the beginning of a very long, incredibly bad, cringeworthy joke. Thanks for nothing Disney."
Its great start to the newest trilogy
"This movie is not as good as the prequels and the originals IMO, but it's pretty good. I do like the new characters. The main issue with this movie is that it has too many similar aspects to A New Hope. Other than that, it's a good movie."
Trash. Garbage. Redo these movies please!
It's a complete rehash of the original Star Wars but their only going through the motions completely missing the spirit of the original and what made it so great
muy entretenida estuvo bastante bien
"The plot of this movie is a joke.
It destroys what was built by the classic and prequel movies.
Everything is out of proportion."
"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, The Force Awakens successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy."
"The Force Awakens is an affectionate love letter to the original Star Wars trilogy, with impressive technical effects and action scenes, and an engaging story that shows promise for future installments that would eventualy turn in dissapointment."
"Serves as a fun homage to the OG trilogy and a commentary on Star Wars myths, while introducing new interesting characters"
"There's heart, but that can't save it from unengaging pacing, a rehashed plot, and rather unlikable characters. It's not bad, but it's definitely not good. 75%."
"The first half hour is a really good movie! It's only when the plot gets moving that it has problems. Daisy Ridley brings a lot to her rôle, even though it's poorly written. 

Although it is a passable cinematic  experience it's weighed down by plot holes, puzzling lapses in logic and uninspired direction."
"It was completely different from the Prequel and Original, which makes sense since this is the Sequel. It is pretty cool and awesome, especially the ending."
"Great comeback, solid action"
"Un ottimo inizio per la nuova parte della saga di Star Wars. Appassionante, avvincente, che colpisce molto lo spettatore."
It was nostalgic and I love the new characters but this movie was so safe it didn't do much for me. Cool Star Wars movie nevertheless.
I feel this is a good start is not the best but entertained.
"While the purpose of the movie was to pay homage to the original trilogy, the film could've done a few things with new and unique ideas instead of copying and pasting ""A New Hope."" However, The Force Awakens did bring back great memories and was fun to watch. Great acting from John Boyega,  Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and of course, the Legacy cast: Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and (even if he didn't say anything from the movie) Mark Hamill."
"The movie was fantastic is the most interesting movie of the Star Wars saga. It has the story of Kylo Ran and Luke. This movie is inforgetable.
                                     It was a good movie."
"The movie is very interesting there is a lot of action, it isn't boring, the characters are good, the plot isn't repetitive and the soundtrack is very nice. With the force Kylo Ren almost kill Ray."
"It doesn't need to exist. It's just Disney's way of cashing in on the Star Wars brand. It's not a bad movie, it's just not really Star Wars. The Star Wars story ended at Return of the Jedi. That was the perfect ending. No need to go on with what is is essentially the same story as A New Hope."
"Instead of the confusion and ever-changing story of the other films outside the OT, Force Awakens delivers a back-to-basics simple story that will keep viewers highly engaged with its visuals, characters and acting, even if it does seem to have many similarities to the film that started it all."
"Steady but a little boring. Not a brilliant work, just not bad."
"There's making an homage, then there's blatant rip-off; there is so much of A New Hope here that it blows my mind."
"even though it might feel like an imitation of episode iv, it' a great way to re-enter in the star wars universe."
"A great movie, first star wars movie that made me get into the franchise. So good."
"I haven't seen Solo yet, but this is easily so far the best thing Disney has ever done to Star Wars."
Masterpeice! JJ introduces new characters and mixing them in with the old cast to deliver a great story thats true to the roots of star wars. Star wars is back!!
"New Hope but worse. Kylo Ren is acting like an angsty teen and Rey is overpowered. Poe survived because...yeah. Finn is a comic relief even though he could have been the most interesting character in the movie. 
 The movie is still fun to watch and doesn't make you want to jump out of the window."
"Even though this is the most “Play It Safe” Film in the entire saga, it sure packs a huge punch that started the Sequel Trilogy off amazing!"
A good start with good characters
THIS MOVIE RUINED STAR WARS FOR ME. IT COPIED EPISODE 4 IN MANY WAYS. SCREW YOU DISNEY.
"This movie does try too hard to be like A New Hope Andy the villain may not be as intimidating as previous villains. But that certainly doesn't mean that this film isn't fun and action packed, including some unexpected twists and turns."
Fresh beginning for the franchise. Hated that Han Solo was killed though.
"This movie is the only movie from the new trilogy that has good pasting and good story. But as Stephen King said in IT Chapter 2: ""I Didn't like the Endin' """
la fuerza despierta fue excelente para comenzar la era secuela de Star Wars
"J.J. Abrams delivers a fun Star Wars thrill ride, even if it is a little predictable."
"A good movie with good characters. Although the plot was pretty similar to A New Hope, it had some differences that made it good."
"A good movie with flaws. My main complaints is that it is a rehash of A New Hope and Rey is a bit to op. Other than that this is a great movies with fun action scenes, nostalgia, great new characters and great scenes with the Original trilogy characters. Easily the best of the Sequel Trilogy"
"A love letter to a new hope, this movie is great"
The farce awakens more like. What a total disappointment.
"The return of Star Wars was the best thing Disney did with it, it was really fun and did something that the prequels did not - it felt as good as the original trilogy."
Didnt know what to expect when sitting down to watch this. But I mean it kinda seemed like we had a lot more coming in the trailer. It was good tho
The movie was watchable some negatives are the acting at points was some times unpolished or rough positives are it still gives off the same magic that drew me in as a kid and really felt like a part of the OG trilogy
"Pros: The opening scene is Amazing especially when Kylo Ren catches a projectile with the force. Finn and Poe's bonding was great and they had great chemistry. Kylo Ren is a great villain and he has such a cool mask and lightsaber and he is the best character in the new trilogy for the most part. The map to find Luke SkyWalker idea was good and they made it so this movie wasn't too similar to a New Hope. The stuff with Rey on Jaku was pretty good and her flying the Millenium Falcon and Han Solo is the best he has ever been in StarWars in this movie and Harrison Ford gives off the performance of a lifetime. Chewbacca is great and seeing most of the original trilogy again was great. The stuff on Star Killer Base was great. Han Solo's death is the most heart-gripping death in StarWars' history. All the characters are very likable like Poe and Finn. It was nice seeing the original trilogy again and the comedy works and was my biggest surprise about this movie.

Cons: The movie feels a bit too similar to a New Hope. I feel like they wasted Captain Phasma in this movie. There is a couple of stupid scenes with Rey being a Mary-sue when she is captured.

I still really enjoy this movie and it is one of the most rewatchable StarWars movies.I'm going to give Starwars the Force Awakens an (A-)"
forgetable and unfalorable to the prevous films buy the end the filmmakers had no idea how to take lucas's films the lacks immagation humor and story best not watch this film
The best entry into the new SW sequel trilogy. It introduces interesting new characters and sets up some intriguing plot points. The main critique of the film rings true for me as well - it leans way too heavily into nostalgia and lacks originality. It's basically a remake of A New Hope; but it doesn't kill the film. A solid entry to the SW universe.
"The best starwars movie since, Empire Strikes Back. Easily the third best star wars movie"
"The worst Star wars history! The whole film was annoying and the new characters was bad only Poe & BB-8 is good but the characters especially Rey,Kylo Ren and Finn are the worst characters in SW saga! This story is a copy-paste of epis.4 and the duels of sabers was really dumb a really shame for the ancients actors, they're returned was the only best thing of the film, but the film is not worth it, a bad trilogy SW!"
Pleasant pastiche but devoid of any reason to care about literally anything that happens in the film.
I think is a glorious return of the Star Wars Saga
"Definitely got my excitement up for more content going forward.
Legends had some odd stories here and there, but the new cannon does too."
"After so long, the wait is over! The Force Awakens really kicks off the Sequel Trilogy with an amazing start, introducing us to awesome new characters like Rey and Kylo Ren, and featuring old ones like Han Solo and Chewbacca! While there are similarities to A New Hope, I barely noticed because of all the fresh story and new characters. While it has great action, it also includes really emotional scenes as well, featuring the end of Han Solo. A great start to the new trilogy!"
"This movie had high expectations and yet was completely derivative and failed to do anything unique. Another death star? The Empire is back, again, with some new lipstick? Come on now."
"This is a good introduction to the new trilogy. It has fun characters, some new locations and ideas, and plenty of strong action sequences. However, the film does not break enough new ground to be considered great. It feels quite similar to A New Hope, a film I love for its originality. Also, I think Adam Driver was a poor choice for a villain. He looks like an absolute loser as if Rodrick from Diary of a Wimpy Kid became evil. Overall, I enjoy the film even if it doesn't quite bring me back to the first 3 films."
"They tried to recreate Episode 4 in as few steps as possible. The accomplishments of all the characters from the Original Trilogy get completely wiped away so the not-Empire can fight the not-Rebel Alliance all over again, not matter how much damage it does to the world building of the galaxy. One of the laziest films I've ever seen, and the worst part is it is by far the strongest of the sequel trilogy."
"I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and I feel like this was a rather large disappointment.  J.J. Abrams did what he was paid to do, so I don't begrudge him for that, but The Last Jedi is a better movie and no one can convince me otherwise."
"This movie is just so easy to enjoy.I don't really have much to say about the movie.The only things that I don't like is the dialogue.The movie's dialogue isn't bad it's just okay, and the fan service is pretty annoying.I will not address the Rey arguments just because they're dumb.Anyway the movie is good."
Nice reboot for Star Wars (kind of a reboot). Nice break from the nightmare that was the prequels. Best one of this trilogy. Fun movie!
"I had problems caring about the new characters, other than Finn that is.  Maybe the movie should have made him the lead instead of following the path they chose?  The whole thing was a search for Spock, I mean Luke, and the ending didn't pay off in any way.  I'm not sure this is the path forward for SW, maybe they should have let it be for another 10 years until someone actually had a story worth telling."
Um filme muito bom um dos melhores de 2015 na minha opinião
The liberal propaganda machine ramming their ideology down our throats. It's a shame what happened to the last 3 movies
"This movie is an amazing well-made rollercoaster action Sci-Fi space ride from the start to finish as it moves at an incredibly brisk pace. This movie establishes the most complex villain in all Star Wars, Ben Solo. Knowing that this character won't be as menacing and a classic as Darth Vader they turn him into an immature, impulsive child who hides his insecurity behind a mask. This should not work at all but Adam Driver sells it and gives us the best character in this new trilogy. All the other characters are also great, Rey, Finn, and Poe. My favorite character in this film was Finn, the ex-stormtrooper who believes in the right thing to do. Even though this character is the most interesting character in the movie, it is painful to see how he utilized the other movies. This is the best movie in the trilogy but I personally love The Last Jedi more. Regardless, I would give this an A 90%"
trash reboot of episode IV
"This new trilogy (episodes VII, VIII and IX) is completely dispensable and should be ignored, as it completely distorts everything that was previously done about Star Wars in films, books, games and comics"
"Shall we make a rehash of episode 4? Disney:"" why yes, yes of course. "" it was like watching episode 4 all over again. The only reason to watch was to see the old characters and to introduce the new characters. What they gave us was Rey, an over powered ""Jedi"" with no training who magically can pretty much do anything a experienced Jedi can. Finn, the winy character we have t learn to love because he's a main character. And Poe, probably the coolest one out of them all except how hard they make him to be like Han Solo. The only thing the new movies had going for them was the light saber battles."
"The long-awaited and anticipated return of the ""Star Wars"" saga has arrived with ""The Force Awakens"", an epic, dazzling, emotional and superbly acted start to a new beginning for the series. After the MOSTLY underwhelming prequel trilogy (with the exception of ""Revenge of the Sith""), director J.J. Abrams has taken the chair with a keen eye. They spent a massive 245 million dollars on this film, and every cent has fortunately paid off. The new characters (Rey, Finn, and Poe) are intriguing, and they also introduce a new villain (Kylo Ren), who is surprisingly developed. A nearly-perfect combination of new roles and nostalgia, this is something to be seen.

90/100"
Y'all seen a new hope?
"It's better then the last jedi, but after seeing this, along with many other very poor desicions disney has made with star wars, it's safe to say Disney doesn't really care about Star Wars fans."
"For the return to Star Wars that I was eager for, it fell kind of flat.  I wanted to know what happened in the last 30 years, and I wanted to see my childhood heroes at the forefront of the story again.  I like the new characters just fine, and I accept that you can't center an action adventure story on 60-year-olds.  But I wanted to be brought back into the setting with the familiar.  I also wanted it to not be a carbon copy of episode 4... which would include meaning that there isn't an Empire/First-Order that still in military control.  Why bother winning the war in Return of the Jedi?  If nothing is going to change, Return of the Jedi is pointless.  So, I think episode 7 failed at setting us up for the sequel trilogy and put us on a bad path for story that could have been amazing.  But it's still more enjoyable than episode 8."
"Loved this episode. Sequel trilogy remains to be a celebration of Star Wars. The Force Awakens claims to the sagas former glory, while at the same time builds on new characters (who are all amazing)! Not my favorite in the saga, but was my first time seeing a Star Wars film in a theatre. Will always hold a special place in my heart! ❤️ Godspeed, Rebels!"
If you have seen a new hope then there is no point to watching this movie.  It is basically a shot for shot remake. The parts that are different are filled with lazy screen  writing and very poor choreography.
"Not only is The Force Awakens an inferior carbon copy of the original Star Wars, but its two sequels further ruin it retroactively.
J J Abrams is a hack who relies on cheap nostalgia and mysteries that not even he knows the answers to. 

No original characters are memorable. 
When Rey meets Han Solo, she one-ups him at fixing his own ship. Contrast that to when Luke meets Han Solo in the original Star Wars:

Luke: [shocked] Ten thousand!? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
Han: But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

When Luke meets Princess Leia, she says, ""Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?"" Then she quips, ""This is some rescue."" 

In contrast, when Finn meets Rey, he is in love with her and tries to hold her hand, asking, ""You got a boyfriend—a cute boyfriend?""

When all other characters immediately like the main character, the audience cannot relate to her.

It almost feels as if a computer algorithm spat out the script. You could almost call it a Bad Robot. Ba dum tss."
"While obviously a soft reboot of the original trilogy, it is a good looking movie and it comes with the Star Wars bonus.
The weak story is good enough, if you don't think too much about it."
"This movie is to blame for every bad thing in the sequels, the first part of the trilogy is the most important because that one sets the stage, that one determines what happened during the 40 years of backstory. 
If we look at the prequels, we see that there was worldbuilding done there, the galaxy in the prequels is fundamentally different from the galaxy in the OT. You start with this world, and then you build a story that flows organically from the events in that world.

The prequels fundamentally showed a different status quo, instead of the Jedi being these hermits, we were in a different part of their history, here they were interwoven with politics, they were basically public servants. Instead of a empire ruled by a galactic dictator you had this horrible inefficient republic that had basically grown too bloated with politics and technicalities to function. These changes are clearly shown, we see life as it is throughout these movies, which helps us place and understand the characters in the world.

But the force awakens didn't do this. The galaxy in TFA is fundamentally the same as the one in the OT, which is absolutely disastrous since that tells us that the actions of our heroes of the OT didn't matter, it all becomes meaningless. If Luke has also become a random hermit, then all our fantasies about lukes life fall to pieces, his life was wasted. If the last order is around building death stars then none of it really mattered. 

Sure, it's somewhat stated that there is a new republic or something, but it gets blown up immediately, we don't see this new world and how it slowly falls apart, we are still just a bunch of rebels in space....none of it mattered. 

Compare this to the mandalorian, which is all about showing the galaxy living and reacting to the fall of the empire, it's 100% driven by worldbuilding and stage setting.

TFA took the most famous heroes, broke up the most famous couple, never showed the three on screen together (WTF!), and then killed one of the three to prevent anyone from fixing this mess. This is such a fundamentally poor decision that it boggles my mind, present this in film class and you'd get kicked from the university. Who in their right mind would take the most famous trio in movie history, one that people have been waiting to see together again for FORTY YEARS, and then NOT have them share a scene?...

It's been 40 years, Disney should have spend the necessary time to set up the world, show what Luke has done, create a new Jedi order that has learned from the past and stays away from politics, we should see Han and Leia be a family, we should see the fruits of their labors and cry as it all falls apart over the course of a three movies, and cheer at the slow passing of the torch to a new set of heroes. Instead, TFA skipped all that and went straight to the new heroes that no one cared about. And because we didn't take the time to acclimatize to the old heroes again there are no tears when they sacrifice themselves, and since the movies didn't take the time for us to get to know the new heroes we can't cheer for them when they become the heroes.

TFA killed star wars, it just took three movies to bleed out."
It started out really good. And then Han and Leia spoke to each other and you really that ROTJ was not as happy as an ending as you thought. And that the substance of our beloved characters were sabotaged...what a terrible thing to do to Star Wars.
"Love Rey & Kylo. Acting is fantastic all around. Good story, good drama."
"I didn't really mind that the story was so symilar to episode IV. But they could have changed something, I guess... :S"
A remake of A New Hope.
Just a Disney made watered down version of the original Star Wars film.
"While surely a dazzling visual and technical adventure, the film sets up a series of questions just for the sake of mystery, without really having any answers for them. The story is frustratingly unoriginal, but introduces us to some very interesting and likeable characters, in addition to a compelling villain."
dont believe this rotten tomatoes hack. This movie was a disappointment.
Could have been worse...
Increadibly cinematic! Star Wars: The Force Awakins is an increadible step up from the original Star Wars films.
"Gosh, I really hope JJ has a coherent plot line and full character arc for all of these ideas he's pitching, otherwise we're going to end up with a mishmash of semi-recognizable events that make us say, ""Oh, yeah, I kind of remember that,"" but without actually creating anything new."
"repetitivo, confuso, sem nexo"
So basically episode IV but in shitty?
"A boring meh fest. Only rotten tomatoes rigged 86% unethical review system can save it. Help Me Rotten Tomatoes. You're my only hope...

Kylo Ren actor was bad... Pointless scenes.. A death scene which seemed as unenthusiastic and unemotional as a Blade runner voice over."
"Lazy movie, no risks were taken. Rey is overpowered. The movie is good entertainment though."
MELHOR STAR WARS FOREVER
"Star Wars: the Force Awakens is a great start for the newly begun(hmm, it's already been 4 years) Star Wars trilogy. I loved the action scenes, the CGI, and the amazing cast (Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are awesome, not to mention the return of Harrison Ford). There's so much to be excited about this movie if you ever thought that Star Wars movies were fun. The only disappointment: the lack of originality. I mean, eveything about the First Order and the Resistence seems somewhat similar to that of the Empire and the Rebellion. But who cares??? Force Awakens is really impressive and that's all that matters, for now."
"Made me hopeful about Star Wars in the hands of Disney.

Safe and uninspired, but competent."
"exhausting, boring, nonsensical and derivative. An insult to the audience."
"Remake of episode 1? they f..k the star wars universe, logic..don't care about the story, only about the propaganda. There are plenty of issues...It is not a science fiction movie but an action movie..."
Measly additipn the star wars universe nowhere near as good as the new episode 9
"Entertaining, faithful, nostalgic, with new empathetic protagonists and a plot that reminds us of the original trilogy but its lack of originality and similarities with Episode IV makes The Force Awakens a good start but not what was expected."
It was a set up and a nostalgia trip - and I'm ok with that.
I just LOVE this movie!
"(Spoilers)
You have the chance of creating a brand new star wars trilogy and what do you do?
1) Give it a plot that is a rip-off of episode 6 which is a rip-of off episode 4;
2) Nullify episode's 6 ending
3) Create rip off characters
4) Do not explain the villain nor the main character's power.
Tis is the worst kind of movie that relies only on fan's nostalgia while bringing only recycled concepts."
"Boyega is a eunuch of a man, stripped not only of his masculinity but of all character and personality as well.  White men are are all space nazis.  And Rey is as powerful as Darth Sidious without training, facepalm.  This is a complete wreck."
"The Force Awakens was a nice transition from the original trilogy to this new Disney sequel trilogy. It was familiar enough to fans while introducing new faces to this Star Wars universe. The humor was good and the pacing as well. The issues with this movie are its rehashing of A New Hope, and probably too few original plot choices to really forge a path of its own. What is this new trilogy trying to say? The Force Awakens did lay down some nice threads for subsequent films to build on. This movie is worth a watch and the soundtrack is great too. It's not quite as amazing as the original trilogy and it doesn't have the emotion and excitement of Anakin vs Obi-Wan, but it has its moments."
"Not only is this the Best of the sequel trilogy (with The Rise Of Skywalker in a close second, and The Last Jedi not far behind in third [I love all the SW films]) it is possibly on of the best in the franchise! Love the characters, the style, the questions, the pacing, it was really well done!"
"A stellar movie that leans in on the nostalgia while still adding refreshing ideas to the mix. I found the story to be very interesting and the film was good at building upon the Star Wars lore. One of my only real complaints is that the characters are pretty standard, and Kylo Ren acts as a pretty weak villain. The cast can still hold up quite well though, due to the material being written fairly well."
"THE FARCE AWAKENS !!! 
We wait 32-33 years to see the Return of Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and all we got was 6 seconds of screeen time & NO DIALOGUE. 👎👎👎👎
What a waste of a golden opportunity  😠"
Excellent movie to start the sequel trilogy an introduce its new characters. Feels like Star Wars.
Great start to the trilogy.
"Excellent production value. Good script, though a bit childish. Not a very original storyline considering the potential that this universe allows. Also, there is a great deal of legacy content with better more original writing."
"Better than the prequels. I guess. Nothing memorable about it. Not something I'd think to watch again in 2, 5, 10, 30 ye.. ever again."
"JJ Abrams breaths new life into this franchise by getting back to its roots of strong characters, fun adventure, and exciting action.  Despite sticking a bit too closely to the plot of the original Star Wars, Abrams and writer Lawrence Kasdan do enough to put a new spin on certain character tropes while keeping the film moving at a brisk enough pace to keep it engaging throughout."
"You know, star wars seems like such an easy franchise to win with. I've only seen the first two newest movies and they were aimless. It was fully obvious that they were making this up as they went along. They should have had a solid writer and paid him or her their weight in gold for a complete trilogy. It would have been great cinema. My problem with the the force awakens: Rae's character was underdeveloped and did not make the audience relate to her. Finn's character was underdeveloped and did not make the audience feel for him. Ren's character should have showed an ascension to power to lead the empire instead of already being in a power position. Rae's character could not have been as naturally skilled as she was with a light saber and instead should have been gifted in force power, surprising Ren somehow and escaping star killer base. Mas kanata, why? The other question about mas kanata, why why why? My problem with the second installment, the last jedi: everything. Mainly, I had an issue with the fact that Luke skywalker was not a G. Being a jedi for all of the years, luke should have been cutting war machines to pieces and force throwing stormtroopers through walls with ease. But what do we see as Luke skywalkers top skill? A force projection that cost him his life. It reminded me of the time Daffy duck wanted to show the best magic trick and blew himself up turning into a ghost to a thunderous round of applause, but instead of applause, exponentially more people let out a collective grown and wanted their money back. Even Mark Hamill admitted he read the script trying to see how Luke matured and wondered, ""who is this guy?"" In regards to Luke's character arc. Then there were other problems: The space chase? The battle on the salt plains? While george Lucas seemed to have some type of logic with the war settings in the first three films, this trilogy seemed to simply regard settings as cool looking places to film battles. After watching the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, I knew I would not be paying for movie tickets for the third. I'll catch the latest installment on redbox."
"A lot of people criticize this movie for having a plot that's a near carbon copy of the original ""Star Wars""--But that's one of the things I like about it!  I thought this was a successful ""reboot"" of the SW franchise in that it felt more like the original trilogy than any of those crappy prequels.  (Man, those prequels suck!!!)  In my opinion, a familiar plot and a bunch of familiar--albeit much older--faces is exactly what was needed to rekindle the spark and get real SW fans excited again.  Believe it or not, after seeing this movie, I had brief hopes that the SW franchise was in good hands, and that Disney would be churning out great SW films for many years to come.  Alas, it was not meant to be as every SW film since ""The Force Awakens"" has been inferior, reaching absolute rock bottom with ""The Last Jedi"" which was a DELIBERATE slap in the face to SW fans everywhere.  (Rian Johnson is a complete idiot.)  It looks like ""The Force Awakens"" will live on forever as my fourth favorite SW movie after the original trilogy..."
the movies premise: hey do you guys remember star wars?
"Episode VII of Star Wars also happens to be the Seventh best Episode in the franchise. Go figure. All that $ and power at Disney, along with all the collaboration that went into this film, and the best they could come up with was swiping and retconning George Lucas' script for episode IV?!? Seriously?"
Great start for the sequel trilogy! I really loved the nostalgic feeling and the awesome visual solutions
"A mostly decent introduction of the new characters that plays it a bit too safe. It is well executed, and while it does have a lot of issues, it still ends up being an entertaining watch."
"Re-watch/Re-rate) First re-watch since my (bare-bones) original post in February to pregame Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and I must say, I enjoyed it even more than the first viewing. I thought Episode VII was a good blend of nostalgia-blasts and character development for the many new faces added to the franchise. We got more insight into the First Order, or the Neo-Empire, with Finn's defection, and how the Resistance (the Neo-Rebels) has managed to stay cohesive, fully expecting the dark-side to rise once again. Of course, I wanted more light-saber battles, but I admittedly have an insatiable thirst for light-saber battles, so no points lost there. My biggest gripe this viewing was Rey's constant questioning if they Jedi, and Luke Skywalker, were ever real. It didn't make sense considering Kylo Ren trained to be a Jedi with Skywalker, a man who pretty much everyone assumes is alive, but hidden. I understand despotic regimes rewrite the past (I've read ""1984""), but the Republic was very much in power during most of Rey's life, not the First Order, and the Star Wars Universe extends for galaxies, therefore making it unrealistic such a well-known figure would merely be wiped from history within one/two generations. Nevertheless, The Force Awakens is a fantastic start to the final trilogy of a beloved franchise."
"Only positive thing of that movie are special effects that got very advanced comparing to other movies.Movie has no story,some scenes are to long.You wait whole movie for some good action or star wars spirit but it doesnt come.Main character is played well though its really bad written.Main antagonist is really weak and new order brings no feelings at all comparing to old Empire.Some jokes are really bad and can be compared to Avengers as they dont suit here.Overal its action movie for one time."
"Amazing, i loved it."
I did not like this film as I felt like it made little to no sense and was banking on nostalgia.
"I think that is the copy of EP. IV, A New Hope."
"Don't even start watching the Disney Star Wars series, this movie is full of plot holes and features a Mary Sue main character that will break all in universe laws in order to effortlessly win any situation she's placed into"
"This movie is a great start to the sequel trilogy and never fails to amaze me with the story, characters, and visual effects"
Well made but takes itself too seriously. The tongue in cheek lovability of the franchise is lost behind  it's slick gloss.
"The best of the 3 new Trilogy movies. That is about the only good thing I can say about it. Mostly its a carbon copy of a New Hope but they had to add SJW crap and make Han a dead beat Dad and kill him. Changed the family lineage, Ben is a Skywalker and son of Luke and his wife Mara Jade. Han and Leia have Jacen and Jaina twins and younger brother Anakin Solo.  They SHOULD have stuck with the family tree from EU at least if not any of the stories.  Heir to the Empire would have been an AWESOME trilogy instead of the crap we got in these three Disney Shill films. Kathleen Kennedy, the Force is NOT FEMALE, its NOT MALE, it has no GENDER. You have no understanding of SW and ruined it."
"The CGI in Force Awakens is impressive, but it feels like the film is heavily focused on Star Wars nostalgia, than everything else that makes a movie work."
A pale copy of A New Hope.
"Really useless, it's worth only for the feeling to see again some of the old characters. But the sequel are even worse."
Great filmmaking but very poor story and ideas.
So much potential wasted... I wish Lucasfilm could reset the last two films.
Lots of fun if a bit un original . But really enjoyable
"It’s very fun and good movie, 25% of the story wasn’t good bt overall a very fun good movie"
Okay start for the sequel trilogy with lots of interesting mystery boxes ala JJ Abrams. Repeated story beats from the original movies bring the experience down a notch.
"This movie is extremely good. The acting is incredible, the visuals are breathtaking, and it has all the fan favorite characters. I definitely would recommend The Force Awakens to a Star Wars fans or any movie goer."
PC crap with no point other than a money grab for Disney.
Rewatched on 12/28/19.
I actually liked this one. But the other 2 was pathetic!!
"A solid start to the new trilogy... truly a shame that the following movie, TLJ, pounded the plot, characters, and promising loose ends into an insignificant piece of trash."
"It was an OK way to start off the Disney Era Skywalker Trilogy. Had it not been followed up by TLJ and TROS, I would probably have more respect for TFA."
"JJ Abrams caters to the audience's nostalgia to perfection, creating a trip through the memory lane of the original trilogy. I loved the growth and development of the new characters. BB-8 is just about the most perfect merchandisable character.
Overall a great watch, but the movie appears to lack in the originality of content and seems a bit too formulaic."
"Taking on the final trilogy had to be hard but JJ Abrams did a great job of delivering.  While not as good as A New Hope or Empire (few movies are) this was a very well written and made movie with some truly awsome moments.  Really nailed it and, honestly, probably delivered the best movie realistically possible."
basically a fanservice remake.
After the prequels this is a breath of fresh air. Kylo ren is amazing and Rey has charisma.
"I already saw this movie before. It was called Star Wars, Episode 4."
The Force Awakens really captures the Star Wars magic we all love! I loved the characters and the overall story! Great movie!
"Começar bem é o normal. Como filme é bom, como começo de franquia é péssimo. Pior trilogia."
If it wasn't such a blatant soft reboot it would be a good film.
My personal favorite in the Star Wars movie series.
"Good Stuff: A great call back to the original trilogy, exciting new character, Poe is actually good,
Bad Stuff: A little bit to much fan service."
"This movie doesn't define what Star Wars is about, it's bland and forgettable but it has its moments, not many of them, but it does have them."
Amazing I love this film <3
"Remake of episode 4 with a heavy coat of disney paint. Kylo was cringy here but he would improve as the series continued. Finn was interesting in this movie but unfortunately will never be again. Rey fails to connect or be interesting, and lacks a personality, making the mostly pointless trilogy begin with a uningeging movie"
Pretty awesome intro to new characters in a new Star Wars trilogy. A nice tip of the cap to Some characters of old.
"The worst that could happen to Star Wars, and the movie industry in general."
This movie was super enjoyable and leaves tons of super cool loose ends for a great sequel! I'm really excited
The movie is good. Glad that this brings back some nostalgia.
"Yes, it's a complete remake of A New Hope but the goal of JJ Abrams was to re-introduce Star Wars to a new generation and the perfect template of that is A New Hope. The last Star Wars before Force Awakens was 10 years ago with Revenge of the Sith. The Force Awakens carries the essence of ANH hero's journey while introducing a new generation of Star Wars heroes and villains. It reminded us the reasons why we love Star Wars in the first place in a more accessible and modern tone."
"My brother hates this movie, but I had a real blast. Too much happens and it is dumb that (spoiler alert) the emperor is back. But I really thought the fan service was cool and didn't come off as too distracting. People who complain about this movie need to stop focusing on their subjective negative opinion and enjoy the magic."
"I'm so sorry, George. I wish this would have been the story you wanted to tell. A lost trilogy."
"Horrible!  So yeah special effects were OK but man this was a downer of a movie. I mean why bother?  Star Wars fan don't expect to be taken seriously, it's just that kill off the past mentality so we can make money off our action figures from our own characters and not have to pay Lucas anything because that smart man never gave up his rights for Action Figures right"
Originally gave this film 2.5 stars.  Now that I have seen the concluding film of the trilogy I can conclusively say that this film is not the worst of the trilogy.  That is all i can say about this steaming pile of crap... the one that came after stunk even worse
Mediocre at best. Definetly does not deserve the same rating at a new hope
Was a disappointment to the Star Wars Series. They replicated the 4th Movie yeah it all comes together in the 9th movie but it’s still a little lack luster.
I do not understand the purpose of this movie. I do not like the actress is missing a lot in acting. Disney must apologize for this movie.
"The best of the sequel trilogy also benefited from a proper three-year development process, which wasn't afforded to any of the subsequent Disney releases."
Good action sequences but horrid characters and story. Force powers don't make sense given experience of Jedi. Bizarre PC crap from Disney. Reviews make no sense
The Best movie besides the original trilogy. The plot was surprisingly good and great start to Disney's star wars trilogy. Amazing character development and action packed. Loved it.
"When you actually bother to watch a movie in one sitting- was enjoyable but nothing too special

Man I rate things highly I do this with the books XD"
"Let the force sleep. A paste and glu from the first trilogy with good special effects. But such a poor acting. Truly disappointing if you have seen episode 4. Could be pleasant for Newbies.
Give me 'Heir to the empire' from Timothy Zahn."
Episode 4 all over again. JJ remakes movies and rips them off.
Awesome beginning to the new generation. Very good. Love the new heroes and great to see the old favorites.
Watched it when it came out entertaining but it's so innaccurate and terrible
"There is nothing I did liked about the movie. There was none stop action through it, it was awesome. All the actors were great. This movie is a must see."
A Pesar De Que Tiene Muchos Elementos De La Trama Trasladados del Episodio IV A Está Pero La Ventana es Que Hace Que sus personajes te Intriguen Y Los Efectos Especiales Son Maravillosos Y Te Mantiene al borde del asiento y No Te Aburre Es Entretenida En Cada Momento
Personally I believe that this is the way to start a trilogy. It introduces new characters and questions which the fans could speculate on. This movie could be a classic if the fat of the trilogy worked out.
"Plants us firmly back in the Star Wars universe
A great combination of old and new...even if it does play it a little to safe in mirroring the start of the original trilogy."
"It does a great job introducing new fans to the series while still making it enjoyable for old fans, however it copies too much from a new hope."
"This is like when grandma bakes some cookies, then grandpa comes in afterword and puts them back in the oven. They were good, until grandpa burned them. Grandma pulled them out and tried to do her best, but in the end all we got were some burnt cookies."
Solo habíamos dos en la sala. La otra persona abandonó a media película. Yo usé la fuerza y aguanté hasta el final. Definitivamente un remake para fans. Insoportable.
This is a pretty good movie that shines especially next to TLJ. It is decent but brings in a new generation fairly well with an intimidating first order.
"If I wanted to see the New Hope and would have watched the New Hope, not what is meant to be a brand new Star Wars movie."
"Formula de la primera, pero al final es el principio del fin."
"Fun the first time around, left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth for every repeated viewing. But not the worst movie out there, a fun action-packed time. Could've used a new story, though."
"Although you can see the frame JJ Abrams used to create the plot (Ep IV), it works. After a break of decade without new movies, introducing new characters using a familiar series of events makes sense. And the new characters are great. Plus an excellent return from Harrison Ford.  Adam Driver, John Boyega and Daisey Ridley are wonderful. Sets up the new trilogy well."
Absolute trash.  Destroyed childhood favorites and the plot makes 0 sense.  Characters are poorly done and the story is trash
"Though similar in story to A New Hope, The Force Awakens reigns in a new era of Star Wars in spectacular fashion."
They took episode IV's New Hope who had even stepped into captivity with Jabba and Palpatine in relentless support of his friends and turned him into a bitter hermit.  Story arcs don't get more twisted.  The new characters had merit but they were introduced in a background of trampling on the old.
"Disney and Jar Jar Abrams do not know StarWars, they need Lucas"
Some good moments but why'd they kill Han?
"Cheap bs. ""Lets make everything the same as A New Hope but bigger and badder!""
No logic, I know Star Wars has always been more towards the fiction side of sci-fi but a huge planet sucking the power of the sun and the laser splits in mid-vacuum to blow up multiple planets?
Also, the First Order is obviously the Empire but bigger and badder too. JJ Abrams just didn't have the imagination to imagine a new republic so ""lets make Rebellion v2: the Resistance!"" Like as cheap fan pandering as you can get in this entire movie with a total lack of imagination. And I was a fan of the prequels too so I'm not just hating on the new thing"
"I thought this was a great movie, when I originally  saw it I was so excited to see all the new characters  and the ending was amazing, including nostalgia from the original trilogy."
brought us back to this amazing world. JJ Abrams is amazing. Great movie. Loved it. Not much else to say really.....
"The best in the new series. Intriguing plot with continued dark side in the family. The chemistry with the original cast members is electric. Rey/Daisy Ridley is great. Finn is ok, good for comic relief. Poe is full and awkward. Adam Driver/Kylo Ren sucks!"
Modern remake of a new hope
"Awful rubbish, glaring continuity issues. Left the franchise after leaving the cinema"
The movie was is a good way until TLJ
"This movie isn't bad as such but gives us only fanbait. The plot is copied on the New Hope, I would have expected new things. It is still a good introduction to the new trilogy but the next two movies destroy everything that is built, thus I don't want to watch this first movie anymore. I know I shouldn't include the next two movie in my rating for this one, but they definitely should have written a script for the entire trilogy - which they obviously didn't. Thus, the bad rating."
"A New Hope, again! 

Really?"
"A above average return to the star wars series. With great effects, score and characters. This movie is brought down by the mediocre plot."
"best of the sequel trilogy, obviously, but it is really a shameless cash grab more than it is furthering the starwars saga. no need to continue watching the Skywalker saga past return of the Jedi."
"This is a fun movie with some really great moments and a pretty decent story. Rey and Kylo are standout characters, and the rest of the ensemble are good additions to the Star Wars Universe. Not the happiest with every decision made in the film- including having Han and Leia separated and making, let's face it, a THIRD Death Star be a major plot device."
I like this first entry into the new trilogy. It's fun and it's exciting. A good introduction to how things are in the galaxy right now.
"I love this movie. Definitely not perfect, but the characters are great and it really inspires the kind of hope that I love from Star Wars movies."
"Awesome movie.
Very nostalgic and well produced."
"Great characters, fun adventure. A pure star wars. It's an undercover reeboot, but that's ok."
"Boring, unoriginal, messy, and unforgivably fanciful. So many elements were taken straight from Star Wars IV (and ineptly so), that it was bound to disappoint. Star Wars IV is a hard act to follow, and lazy writing is going to make matters much worse. The weapon drawing in heat from the sun was horrible, and they didn't go into enough detail about how exactly it wasn't incinerating half of the planet it was sitting on.

Rey and Finn are causing problems for someone trained in sabre-combat and with highly developed force abilities. Whereas previous movies had solid character development, with the characters finding their abilities and powers over time, Rey is almost instantly competent in almost every respect. Any child can write a film about how his favourite character just picked up a weapon and started beating everybody in sight. Oddly, this is one area where the movie SHOULD HAVE BEEN unoriginal, and yet, this was the main area where they decided to deviate.

Leia's role also seemed very awkward and unnecessary. it just seemed like they stuffed her into the story for the nostalgia value, yet I would wager no one would have wanted her pushed into the movie if they were going to make a mockery of her character. She seemed meaningless in the story, despite the central role her fallen-Jedi son was playing. They could have done so much more regarding her relationship with Kylo (they didn't do too bad a job with her relationship with Han), and yet they made this element a real let-down. And her force abilities would have been worth exploring, but they did little here too.

I thought Driver and Ridley acted poorly (especially Driver), but the worst acting came from Domhnall Gleeson. The overacting from Gleeson was thoroughly cringe-worthy (much worse even than Jar Jar Binks in the prequels), and the blatant and un-nuanced bombardment of Nazi imagery was equally bad. There is an art to making historical references in films... This just seemed like a lazy child's approach to drawing parallels between this rising tyranny and the Nazis. This was embarrassingly bad.

The relationship between Poe and Finn was poorly developed too. It seemed like a lame bromance somewhat reflective of what I remember from Top Gun. Another couple of minutes spent building this relationship into something would have been worth it... Not enough to make me forget the Stormtrooper in the shiny, sex-dungeon suit. That still haunts my sensibilities.

There were a few redeeming elements that appealed almost specifically to children. The rolling droid was cute, and I'd imagine that it was a very popular character with younger viewers. And you can't go wrong with bringing back R2-D2. The special effects and stunts were mesmerising as well, and so for kids new to the franchise, these things would have made the movie more palatable.

But overall, were it not for the fact that I'd been watching it with a friend at the time, I'd have walked out not too long after Solo's death scene (which was about the only decent twist in the entire film). The characters were forgettable, the story was weak and implausible, the acting was bad... Not much left to the redeem the film. As a stand-alone, the film was bad. As a part of the Star Wars series, this film was a crime. Couldn't stand it."
"Disney should have taken over the Star Wars saga a long time ago. Possibly before The phantom menace, but latest before Hayden Christensen got cast for Anakin, a horrible choice destroying by terrible acting the greatest Hollywood fable of all time."
A good start to a new trilogy featuring a delightful cast of characters plus returning older characters. The Force Awakens doesn’t set the world on fire so to speak but at least it’s a watchable film in comparison to the dreadful Revenge of the Sith.
"Outstanding! I love Star Wars ♥️ 
Loved this movie. I ♥️ Star Wars."
"Good, but too much a remake of IV"
They really ruined Star Wars with this garbage. Really just awful that they took the greatest concept of all time and used it for a platform of ignorance and politics. Basically stole scenes from the original starwars. The cantina music was awful too. Casting awful. Seriously a huge disappointment.
"Copies not only storylines but recreates actual camera shots from the original trilogy instead of trying to be creative. The movie feels rushed almost all the way through, barely any interesting developement. The unauthentic, overdramatic acting and presentation is probably the worst part for me. There is nothing special about this movie, which is in contrast to all Star Wars movies that came before."
"Was instantly drawn into this story and swept away just like the first time I watched A New Hope as a child. J.J. Abrams knows how to tell a story catered for the audience, everything from the practical effects to the new characters created an exciting first chapter to build upon."
A welcome return to the Skywalker saga.
Just the same story as A New Hope
Worst thing to ever have star in the title
Great start to this sequel trilogy.  Sets up a lot for these new characters and the state of the galaxy post Return of the Jedi. Good film!
A Star Wars movie not even close to being as good as a new hope but is a good beginning to the finial trilogy.
"Good movie! This movie had a lot of hype to live up to, and it ended up being a pretty decent entry into the franchise. The plot felt a little bit unoriginal, but that ""unoriginality"" could just as easily be viewed as a nod to the original trilogy (e.g. Starkiller Base = new Death Star) and to Legends material (e.g. Kylo Ren = Jacen Solo). I think JJ Abrams has a bright future with Star Wars!"
"unoriginal

the new characters are boring and uninteresting"
Ultimately pointless after last Jedi and rise of Skywalker. A massive waste!
Very enjoyable. Awesome characters. Hindered by a re-imagined/rehashed plot.
"Even though the sequel trilogy is a failure, I liled The Force Awakens. At the time of launch, this movie set up a promising trilogy with interesting characters. Even though these characters were wasted in the next two movies, I find this movie pretty cool."
rehash of episode 4 but well made
"Got me excited for the Sequels. I was then disappointed by TLJ, but satisfied by the TROS."
"This one has a narrative thrust that keeps it going and the audience watching and couldn't be faulted for keeping one interested and on technicalities such as visual effects, sound, and production design which are superb."
"Fun film which looks like it will nail it, until the last 15 minutes. Rey is too powerful without training. Kylo is too weak with it."
"Went in completely unaware of what and how star wars was going. Avoided trailers and all news. Left theater wondering why the film felt so familiar when I realized it was a soft reboot of the saga and not a true continuation of the Skywalker saga which actually ended with RotJ. 
Not a bad film, entertaining. Not really any new story elements or new ideas."
"Although I hated what happened to Han, it is really a good movie. It's not perfect. It is a copycat of original trilogy, but it is a good copycat."
"Some bits of fan-service tend to distract, but over-all this is a fun fun movie. A welcome return to the Skywalker Saga."
The movie was okay and Rey was sympathetic but I can't get over a novice holding serve against the second most powerful being in that universe -- Insta-Jedi.
I thought it was a promising start to a new trilogy.
"Loved it, enough said."
"Not original at all, just a copy of past Star Wars episodes. Thanks JJ Abrams, for ruining my beloved Star Wars."
Not a terrible movie but it wasn't great by any means. It was nice getting a fresh Star Wars but it felt like a carbon copy of A New Hope.
It was good and built of good characters that you can like and feel like you have a connection with but it was basically episode four over again
J.J. Abrams delivers a satisfying new Star Wars story that seemingly blends good story-telling with great imagery. (Thanks Rian Johnson for messing up the Last Jedi).
Should be called Star Wars The 2 billion dollars Awakens
Incredible 1st chapter of new trilogy. Great new characters with just the right amount from the original trilogy crew. Loved every minute!
"If this was more or less a stand alone film and not part of a saga or trilogy, it would rate higher. Visual effects, music and editing are outstanding, the script so-so, the acting good overall...

But it isn't...and as a part of an ongoing saga...this film is horrible. ""Lara Croftish"" Rey is a ridiculous Mary Sue...Han Solo is turned into a deadbeat dad...Luke is a mere mcguffin...Leia is fairly inconsequential. Kylo is shown up repeatedly by some untrained Mary Sue...and his Knights of Ren are hollow...and the new arch-baddy Snoke is barely interesting or explored.

The plot/story is an insult to all that came before it. 
95% of all that can be seen as best about this movie can directly credied to its production quality and music.

This movie earns a ""C"" at best as part of a series...as a stand-alone film for non-Star Wars fans...perhaps a ""B"" or ""B+"""
If your looking for a movie to shit all over the original 6 movies this is the movie for you
"Typical JJ Abraham's, mystery-box and go bigger then everything before you even though it doesn't make sense.. it's still enjoyable if you accept it for what it is."
Pretty similar to ‘A New Hope' but with action and suspense. Still an overall decent movie.
The same exact movie as A New Hope.
"Poor writing with the most unimaginative ending imaginable because it's repetitive at this point. A new character introduced that somehow possess the forces and masters the force without even her own knowledge...it just happens. Even Yoda couldn't do this. Fight scene was cringing. Seeing some of the original cast return was heartwarming only to be ruined by Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver. This movie has potential, but it highly depends whether the next movie will answer all those questions."
"I was rather disappointed in The Force Awakens when I first saw it. I was confused and a bit let down by how poorly developed the character of Rey was and how weird it was that everything came so easy to her. Now that I've seen Episodes 8 and 9, it makes a little bit more sense, but at the time, it just seemed too much like 'girl power' nonsense.  My favorite character of the movie was and still is Finn. His journey in the movie is very well done and is quite compelling, which makes Rey's all the worse by comparison. It was great to see the Millennium Falcon, Han, Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 and Leia again, even if they weren't really the main characters this time. Though Han and Chewie do have some great moments in the film.  I thought Kylo Ren/ Ben Solo was a bit disappointing in this film as well, at first, though subsequent viewings on DVD have helped my opinion of him, especially after seeing Episodes 8 and 9. 

It's worth seeing again if you've seen Episodes 8 and 9. Kinda like the prequels, it has some major flaws, but when you watch it as part of a marathon, it works better since some things in it are better in context when seen after Episode 6 and before Episode 8 and 9."
"I've never felt compelled to watch a Star Wars movie past the original. However, I gave episodes 1-3 a chance, and I really enjoyed it. With the ""The Rise of Skywalker"" in theaters. It looks interesting, so let me catch up. It started off well for a few minutes, but I was confused over who this character is (Rey).  Literally, I'm lost!  It reminds me of Luke's first movie. When it shows his humble beginnings on a desert type world, buying droids with his uncle, and other small things that led to him becoming a Jedi.  This new character doesn't connect well with me. I was baffled over how knowledgeable she was, about almost everything she came across, but it was like she was ignorant to those things, and something innate causes her to grasp onto things; as if she has years of experience. The black guy was a storm trooper, that has been storm troopering since he was younger. But for some reason. When he has his epiphany; he becomes scared of gunfire, explosions, and turns into a total panzy. The new sith lord has no intimidating qualities. There's just to many wrong things with this movie, to be a Star Wars movie."
"This movie was bad, but not horrible."
It's a good semi-remake of the Original all the way back from 1977
"I'm not a total die-hard Star Wars fan, but these stories and productions have always been a hodge-podge, and I can and do enjoy that. Here, that isn't challenging at all, it's such a smooth and fluent blend of odds and ends. The biggest criticism is that The Force Awakens is a reboot within the 9-part series. Is that a problem? I liked that about it. Also, I kind of just, um, have a crush on Rey. And the peculiar aliens and distant planets and hap'nin' bars and flying stunts have never felt so fully imagined and realized. Also, on reflection I love the way the Millennium Falcon appears without explanation, as if it's unexpectedly a critical arm of the Force where you never thought to look. Some things are best left unexplained, and this is one. Many people didn't like Kylo Ren for a villain, but I actually love that role. His temper tantrums and eccentric good looks make him seem like an outlandish combination of Oscar Wilde, Benedict Cumberbatch, Darth Vader, and how Anakin Skywalker should have been in the prequels. What others see as ""whining"" and ""weak"" I see as fascinating. You really expect him not to have flaws? You expect those to seem muscularly badass and stoic, rather than a little unhinged? I love the ""family resemblance"" with Anakin, personally, and the personality defects. Anyway, the rivalry between Rey and Han Solo is also funny. Like Leonard Nimoy did with the Star Trek reboot, Harrison Ford adds a powerful gravitas and becomes a sort of spirit guide, flaws and all."
"A good beginning, even if it was a rehash of the original Star Wars."
I was not invested in the new characters and the originals acted out of character.
Not the best of the Star Wars saga but I enjoyed it.
The only good film in the otherwise terrible Disney trillogy please Disney don't ever screw up with Star Wars again.
"To much pandering to the SJW crowd, totally blacklisting the real star wars fans and those who actually cared about this saga as a whole. 👎"
"Even though this movie is a carbon copy of A New Hope, I think it works. In my opinion it is one of the most rewatchable Star Wars films. Had a fun time watching this movie."
The movie could have been so much better.
When first watching this movie it built up great potential but after finally finishing the trilogy you can clearly see that there was no round table discussion as to what needs to happen in this trilogy. Watching it again wasn't as exciting after seeing how the TLJ derailed the potential of all of the characters and overall story.
"My childhood awakens every time I watch this movie, this could easily pass for my top 3 Star Wars films"
"Great action sequences, great acting, great soundtrack, great CGI, but the narrative is too similar to A New Hope and it creates a lot of questions to the viewer. While it doesn't take Star Wars to a new level, it's still enjoyable to watch."
"New Hope 2.0 meh, was ""Hoping"" for more original ideas, Deathstar AGAIN?!?"
Great movie! A clone for ANH but really enjoyed it.
"Great introduction to the sequel trilogy! JJ set up some great plot points, intriguing characters and reminded us all why we love Star Wars!

It's such an utter shame that he wasn't able to do the follow up film, instead we got Rian Johnson's piece of trash movie!"
"Suffers from JJ's obsession that every action scene must have a lot of running.  They must be running from/to something.  Very fast.  Little worldbuilding, too much exposition, but never for the things that would help to know/flesh out the world.  The clowning of Fin begins here and will continue into Last Jedi, very sad."
Utterly unoriginal. Completely empty. Mindless. Banal. A cynical money grab. Nothing more. There will come a time when all parties regret letting  Abrams get his hands on their franchises. The hollowness of what he produces means there will be no lasting value.
Lazy reskin of Episode IV.  Not much else to say.
"They made me watch Han Solo die, with my own eyes."
An okay movie. I felt that it had some missing pieces.
copy of star wars(1977)
"It should be about ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....""
Instead we got a movie that is  reflection of today's PC culture than story in far away galaxy."
"This is a controversial opinion, but I didn't really enjoy this film as much as the others. But it is good. I preferred the rise of Skywalker and the last Jedi."
"Wish they had followed the stories (Books)  we'd grown up with, but still really enjoyed!!"
"Oh look, Star wars with ""Disney magic"". Was their anything new? Nah. Just nostalgic-trip with bland new characters."
"The movie is amazing. It brings back the new saga with fresh new faces but also returns gloriously with the old. Thought it feels like A New Hope reboot, the movie is still new, fresh, and exciting. Easily one of the best Star Wars movies."
Great although predictable.
"This movie i really like, even though im not a big star wars fan, this was very enjoyable"
"Whoever said what, but the trilogy of sequels begins with a very successful picture. J. J. Abrams staged an epic and very beautiful film in the best traditions of the Saga, with respect to the original presenting a new generation of viewers not only the script moves, but also the signature scenery, costumes, minor characters and majestic music of John Williams. Despite some plot miscalculations, there are new topics for the franchise, which are a pleasure to watch. It took me three views to appreciate this movie, that does not happen often."
"""The Force Awakens"" is in its entirety a copy of ""A New Hope"", except for two actually original sequences that are easily the worst of the film. Too conservative."
It's just a money machine
I loved it I only wish it's sequels had been just as good.
Absolutely blew my mind the cgi to the actors to the cinematography just absolutely amazing I think one of the best ever
"I loved it.  It hit all the right Star Wars notes, felt fresh but also feeling familiar."
"This film was a decent start by Disney to re-introduce old characters, and tell a new story in the Star Wars universe. It was fun, felt like a Star Wars movie, and it definitley had me intrigued for what was to come with the final two films."
"This was a great movie; possibly the most exiting of the nine... the first cannot be beat for originality, but this has so much more, story-wise, excitement-wise, imagery.  Fantastic characters, great actors, wonderful plot!"
"With the sequel trilogy in it's first installment, this movie offers some refreshing actions sequences and a good assortment of new and old characters working off each other. Though besides those highlights, the movie sadly relies on the story on the first movie where it feels like a remake of the first movie with plot points here and there, but doesn't feel too much like a retread. It's still worth a watch for newcomers and old timers to enjoy~"
This film was my introduction into the deeper world of Star Wars.
"-unoriginal plot
-story renders conflict of original trilogy futile
-new characters are flat
-devolving of Han and Luke's characters"
"The visuals were pretty great, often amazing.

Unfortunately, the movie has so much pandering forced into it that they actually broke the universe."
Good solid start to the new trilogy
This is a bad remake of a new hope..
"Awful, only Rogue One is great from new films"
Better than The Last Jedi but plagued by vagueness. A decent film but doesn't rise to the level of the franchise. Harrison Ford is excellent though.
"Remember what happened with Star Trek?  You had to take everything you thought you knew and throw it out.  Well, bye-bye Star Wars.  I'll continue to watch but geesh, does this ever feel like a betrayal.  Why didn't they call it ""The Star Wars?""  You probably know what I mean if you know the history of Star Wars.

It felt like a rip-off of the original A New Hope.  Youngster meets mentor, youngster follows mentor around galaxy, mentor is killed by villain, youngster must now go on a quest to save the galaxy."
Boring remake of Ep.7 nothing special about it and an insult to fans
"Star Wars Episode VII is one of the most interesting Star Wars movies ever. I love how this movie is taking the old characters like Luke, Han, and Leia into the new with Rey, Finn, and Poe. I also liked the action sequences, the new characters including Kylo Ren, and the visual effects. The movie may have similar connections with the original Star Wars, but at least The Force Awakens does it just right with new imagination and creativity. Overall, Star Wars: The Force Awakens knows how to kick start the sequel trilogy."
"Not bad, but really just a re-hash of the original."
Excellent Star Wars movie
"Like many fans I was disappointed when I realised that everything from the Expanded Universe was thrown out, even if I understood the reason for it.
Still, J.J. Abrams did an amazing work establishing new loveable characters and starting a new amazing journey for the fans. The movie is not only filled with homage to what has been before but also gives us a nice beginning for a new trilogy."
"Um filme feito pensando em unir o velho e o novo, de uma forma respeitosa e ao mesmo tempo inovadora, um dia inesquecível, onde estive com amigos e pessoas que marcaram uma época muito boa em minha vida."
Pretty good start to the saga!
"Even with it's unoriginal plot the movie still knocks it out of the park, with spectacular visuals and a gripping story to boot.
It's amazing."
a fresh beginning to something new
This episode is really good. I really had a good time.
I was so happy when this came out in 2015 I remember seeing it ALOT in the cinema and I was amazed by it! Great start the the sequel trilogy with lots of nostalgia
There was some decent sense and writing but the needed to open to develop new characters better.
Really love this movie. Rey character is perfect.
"Now when i consider all Sequels, its best of new trilogy. 
Kinda sad..."
Dissapoiment. Should be soo much more.
On it's own it's a good film. I just can't stand the fact that it's basically a new hope 2.0.
I guess the next trillogy will be [insert synonyms of rebellion] vs another authoritative sounding evil group.
Really didn't like the main characters. I have to make up stories in my head as to make them more enjoyable. Rey is boring and a Mary Sue. Making her character the focus is A BIG mistake.
"This a complete rob, if I wanted to watch a new hope I will watch a new hope not this garbage"
good. mostly unoriginal and very similar to a new hope but if you love star wars you will enjoy this.
I enjoyed it quite a lot. It did feel TOO familiar but I understand after the prequel trilogy they wanted to play it safe. I just wish they didn't do another death star story basically.
Very enjoyable. Decent transition from the past to the future of SW. A bit too much like ANH though.
Just a boring retread of the oringinal movies.
The epic start of a new trilogy that kicks off with neophyte characters connecting to classic ones in an adventure that holds the fate of a growing galaxy in the balance.
"I love this movie. As a kid I had always loved the Star Wars culture (action figures, light sabers and the characters) but wasn't attentive to the plots of the movies. This movie was my ""A New Hope"". It really got me into Star Wars and made me the fan I am today. It has thrilling action, chilling nostalgia and a charming new cast to hold up to the Star Wars name while bringing back the old crew. I would recommend anyone who is going through and watching the Star Wars movies to give this a view."
Love the casting for Rey
This movie was a blast! The similarities to A New Hope glaring but I'd take a well crafted remake to a poorly made prequel every time. I rewatched all the live action Star Wars movies before seeing The Rise of Skywalker and this movie stood out as one that was even better than I remembered.
"A fun, if very safe, adventure movie featuring a new set of likeable characters who would all go on to get additional development in the next film.  A very solid start to a new Star Wars trilogy."
"Fun, and definitely the feel of Star Wars, even if it lacks in originality and wild imagination"
"This was largely disappointing overall. The characters are fantastic, but with very little intriguing plot for them work in."
"Solid movie. Wish it was a little more creative and Rey had more weaknesses to overcome (like a real person), but it made me excited that Star Wars was back in a competent manner and made me really look forward to episode 8."
"Perfect return to a galaxy far away. Gives me the energy, atmosphere, and feeling that we are all used to while setting up an intriguing new adventure for us to impart on."
"I suppose looking back today Disney had to somehow tie the original trilogy fans with the new fans they were trying to attract. Hence the rehash of episode 4. The effects are SW top notch as expected, the action scenes are ok if not extraordinary. Would have been nice to have had a story in a slightly different direction to massive planet destroying weapon gets blown up. Still hey ho as I opined to friends much aggrieved with TPM the story has to start somewhere. With TPM that was forgiveable here not so much. But its still a watchable film if a bit irksome in places."
A very Safe Safe start with no risks taken to a new trilogy.
"A good reboot to the series to wash the nasty taste of the sequels out of your mouth. Borrows very extensively from the original Star Wars movie, but in a way that feels pretty good. I mean, Return of the Jedi basically did this already, yes they really built yet another freaking Death Star. The fourth movie in the series about blowing one up, if you count Rogue One. Introduces some fun new characters, played by well-cast actors."
Awesome movie! Very thrilling and nostalgic!
A very safe re-hash of a new hope with large servings of fan service included.
"Although the film has many familiar beats from A New Hope, it is undoubtedly a great film with interesting characters and questions I want answers to. This was a great way to bring people back to Star Wars and a great way to kick of the new trilogy."
I just dont get the critics at all... again a great score for a great movie... force awaken had set up for those who grew up with the original trilogy a great tribute to our beloved characters. It gave respect to those characters who without would not have been a Star wars... fantastic movie...
"Great fun Star Wars film, lots of similarities to A New Hope but still really enjoyable, a great start to the final 3 Skywalker Saga films"
It was an interesting star wars movie. I liked it over all.
"I've seen all the films since 1977 when I was 6 years old.  I wasn't thrilled with the way George Lucas handled Episodes I and II, but this new series is off to a great start with a female protagonist (tired of seeing all dudes as movie leads).  Great movie, true Star Wars fans should go see it if they haven't already."
"Incredibly good time, refreshing new take on Star Wars while following a similar story beat to a New Hope, but to me the movie is not hurt by this similarity. I loved this movie and John Williams is back with an amazing score."
Almost pitch perfect re introduction to Star Wars
It was a homage to the original. Some may day it lacked originality...and it did. But it was a fun throwback to nostalgia and adventure.
Absolutely terrible. They ruined everything!
Basically a soft reboot scam.
"Fantastic new characters alongside the well loved classics, Daisy Ridley outshines them all as Rey."
Great set up to the next movie....
A lame remix of a much better movie or two that doesn't quite feel like Star Wars.
Great beginning for a New Star Wars for a New Generation.
"A  safe re-tred of the original Star Wars (A New Hope) that, while not my taste in terms of humor, provides an undeniably grand Star Wars-y experience that leaves the viewer with hopes for satisfying future answers to the questions it poses and rules it breaks (this doesn't happen)."
Good solid start to the Star Wars universe again. but too similar to ep4
A very fun ride that heads straight into the action. Though this is done carefully with no laziness from JJ.
"Solid reboot. Played it safe but established new, likable characters."
"Rewatched this movie recently. Will never do so again, nothing innovative or interesting happens and the new protagonist is introduced already being the most powerful being in the universe."
"A respectable homage to A New Hope, and decent start to the disney trilogy."
"Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future… the past. Old friends long gone."
"A good starting point, but a little bit too near to Episode IV"
"This movie was plain bad. It felt like it was a tv movie from the Scy Fy channel or a Doctor Who episode, not a theatrical released big budget blockbuster."
"Story is terrible which is a massive shame considering the resources available, including an excellent trilogy already written."
I freaking loved it. Not as good as The Last Jedi tho.
"Put the franchise back on the tracks. Yes, this story has been told before, but it's a fun ride."
Great way to bring Star wars back! JJ is brilliant!
A extremely easy movie to watch
"Insults fans of the original trilogy, of the prequel trilogy, and of George Lucas. Give us the real sequels, as George Lucas dreamt them four decades ago, not this recycled, nihilistic drivel. #MakeGeorgesSequels"
"The force went to sleep during the writing, filming and editing of this film."
"I enjoyed it. Not very original, but fairly well done with likable characters."
The worst star wars movie
The boys are back in town!!! Let the nostalgia flow through you.
"No surprises, but a fun ride."
"It is a B-. A bit of a rehash, but passable. Kylo is cool. Rey is likable. Why introduce BB8 when you have R2D2?"
Great movie to spark a new trilogy
"Love it, already seen a thousand times"
"Also doing a review after seeing TROS. This movie is basically fine, though initially you would be interested who is Snoke (which you will learn in the comics and in the succeeding movies) and his background..

If you are a fan of the prequels, you will be a bit disappointed in the lightsaber battles if you compare this movie to the prequels which set the technicalities of each lightsaber forms, though some will recognize it. 

The idea of the Starkiller base is often criticized at being copied to the idea of the Death Star, which is I think a plot device so to set up a menacing antagonist force.

A movie that can be appreciated easily."
"good, loved how powerfull it was"
Great reintroduction to the franchise albeit it played it safe and didn't bring anything new to the series.
"A fun return to the Star Wars universe. Perhaps a little formulaic, but it almost had to be."
Best of this trilogy!
Complete lack of effort and originality.
JJ has always been great at origin stories and this sets things up well.
Just a cheesy re-imagining of A New Hope.  Wish they would have been more original.
"A couple years later now having viewed up to The Rise of Skywalker, TFA was a great reboot. However Rey being able to actually beat a trained and skilled force user without any training is quite a oversight and bad decision considering her heritage is not known for such skills. This being called Canon Star Wars is quite a stretch."
"Clearly a rehash of New Hope, but still a fun watch."
"Great characters and dazzling Star Wars excitement, a captivating new beginning to Disney's new Star Wars trilogy."
...rotten garbage rot
"The beginning of this movie was incredible and then it just seemed to aggressively ape A New Hope in frustrating and disappointing ways. It's like the Death Star, but bigger, is an actual thing that happens. It just sort of squanders its own world building."
A great start to the Sequel Trilogy.
A tried-and-true formula does not disappoint in this newest iteration of Star Wars. Some memorable characters old and new make for a compelling new yet familiar tale. A valiant effort for the newest entry in the Skywalker Saga.
"A great return of Star Wars, that perfectly sets up the movies to follow it."
My favorite Star Wars movie!
"Taken as a stand alone movie, it was well done with the exception of the already perfect character of Rey. Looking at the film when compared to the rest of the series, it was nothing more than an expensive fan film. Fan films and fan fiction generally have one thing in common, they tell the same stories that have already been told. They just alter things a little. This movie would have been a lot better if Abrams would have developed a truly original plot. Why not go with the story Lucas already created? Change it up a little but stick with the based the creator devised."
"I absolutely love this movie,beginning of the new trilogy,beginning of my my fav. character - Ben Solo."
"The plot was lazy, the main character has no developments and this whole trilogy is a sad take on star wars"
"This is where Disney begun destroing George Lucas legacy. It's a rehash of A New Hope, it lacks originality and, in the end, it's a movie I can no longer watch."
As a film The force awakens feels the most put together of the saga although that does not make it the greatest in the series it is a very soild entry as well as a great starting point for a new trilogy.
"Best entry to the sequel trilogy! After the movie is over, there is so many ways it can go on from that.. obviously that's not the case anymore when I'm writing this, but those were my feelings in december 2015."
just a slurred remake of a new hope
A solid movie to start a trilogy
Loved this film. Definitely was a once in a lifetime event back in 2015.
There is nothing new here. Just give us Old Republic days and be done with this...
A good setup for the new cast and the ride ahead!
"Like Return of The Jedi before it, The Force Awakens is a little too much like Star Wars (AKA A New Hope) for comfort. But it's self-awareness of that fact does it credit, and the film is at it's best when it leans into it's meta elements, something the sequel will capalitize on. But, I talk about The Last Jedi because there isn't that much to say here.
Kylo Ren is a great fill-in for Vader, and Rey, Finn and Poe are excellent and likeable protagonists- even if all three are little too perfect sometimes. 
Han Solo finally gets closure to his arc, and Starkiller Base is better Death Star than the Death Star was. 

JJ wanted to make a Star Wars movie for a new generation. And he did. He just played it a little too safe."
There's not a single thing that saves this.
could we actually think of new plot lines. a new hope has already been done before
A great comeback for Star Wars. Beautiful storytelling and character introductions. An homage to the past with a look into a hopeful future.
This movie is nothing but a quick cash grab using the name of Star Wars. The characters lack personality and the writing isn't helping.
A great start to the trilogy

"Force Awakens is one of my favorite Star Wars movie in the Saga. A great plot, a little bit of a comedic tone, and the best movie to kickoff the Sequel Trilogy."
pathetic copy of the original movie
well if you copy a successful movie I guess its no surprise that it would do good. If you've seen a New Hope you've seen this movie. This is a fan made low quality story movie of a New Hope.
Its simply terrible. Bad story. Bad storytelling. Marie Sue character. Booring character.
"Not as inventive or creative, but it still deserves good praise for bringing the saga back to life."
This was one of the least original films and the writing was laughable
"This movie radiates nostalgia and happiness, mixed with a slew of other emotions. It is a must watch."
Amazing reboot. Lots of original Star Wars themes which I think is great. I genuinely like Rey's character and Kylo Ren is the perfect bad guy who obviously has a more central part to the story than a typical villain.  Really enjoyable!
"So I've been remiss in adding a rating/review for TFA. Now about 7 hours away from watching the conclusion with Rise of Skywalker, I wanted to round out my reviews of the 'modern' or Disney era motion pictures.
For a frame of reference, I saw The Force Awakens with various configurations of friends and family NINE times in the theater. So no matter what criticisms I offer, they do not equate to disappointment. I went to the big screen nine times, and was highly entertained and rewarded each time. TFA was a fantastically fun and rewarding ride that was clearly made with love and reverence for the franchise.
The very first time I saw it, throughout the first act I was stunned with the ever-increasing sense that I was possibly watching the best Star Wars film ever made. It was bold and original. It was an astonishingly fun ride full of intriguing characters, well-paced story telling, tantalizing mysteries and a return to what I call the three C's; charm, charisma and chemistry. The three C's helped make the Original Trilogy films more than just popcorn sci-fi/fantasy (and also I feel that the lack of the three C's are a major part of why the Prequel Trilogy films were met with criticism). 
Outside of not understanding what the heck the First Order was or why there was a Resistance when there was also the New Republic, Act 1 played out like perfection. Rey was a fantastic new addition, clearly primed as the next to take on the mantle of the mythic hero's journey. Poe's dashing bravery gave us a mix of Luke's earnest good-guy heroism with Han's roguish wit and flair for adventure. Of all the new heroes, Finn showed the most promise and intrigue, a Storm Trooper who saw too much and refused to continue to be a part of a vile war machine? Supremely fertile ground for character development and theme exploration, something entirely new to the cinematic Star Wars Universe (I specify cinematic because anyone who knows the greater Star Wars lore knows that this theme is actually quite common and prominent in the stories now relegated as 'Legends'). Kylo Ren's introduction was a mixed bag, clearly he was far more than just a monolithic evil bad guy like Vader was in ANH. His character had personal motivations and agendas instantly made him far more complex and compelling than how is grandfather first appeared to us back in 1977. This unfortunately means he came across (at least to me) as far less fearsome than Lord Vader for that very same reason. Finding out he's Ben Solo automatically means he's going to be redeemed at some point which limits just how fearsome he can be knowing from the outset he is destined for some manner of redemption. His 'horribleness' is then further nerfed by his childish temper tantrums. When Vader was pissed, people died. He killed messengers, he killed underlings who failed their tasks, or simply had the misfortune of having been in charge at the wrong time. Friend and Foe alike feared Vader. Kylo's tantrums made him a bit less terrifying to both the audience and his underlings. But even still, the intrigue of why the son of Han Solo and Leia turned evil was overall an impressive new layer from the outset and, like Finn, promised great opportunity for rich character development and exploration. Snoke.. well.. he was mysterious.. to a fault. Is he a Sith? Where has he been all this time? Why is he the Supreme Leader? What is a Supreme Leader? He is a character who seemed to come out of left field, but again, Act 1 is not the place for answers, it is the place to set up questions.
Even with unanswered questions, Act 1 flows superbly. The pacing is perfect, it slows down as we learn what we need, and then speeds up for the action beats (which are wonderfully rewarding). All in all, that first act sets up for perfection. Sadly, the first act is apparently all the original screen writer Michael Arndt was able to really nail down before he had to surrender the project because Disney had promised a May 2015 deadline and Michael simply does not write that quickly. JJ and Larry Kasdan filled out the rest of the script (and I'm sure modified act 1 to some degree) and it's pretty clear when watching the movie the approximate point that changeover occurs because the tone, quality and sensibility begin begin to falter as soon as Solo's giant barge is boarded by gangs. 
From there we begin to get our retread of ANH in full Force and the pace really gets frantic, seemingly to hide the fact that the story is patchwork and not the same quality as the first act. The sequence at Maz Kanada's is a jumbled mess, the sequence where they throw together a battle plan to take out Starkiller Base practically feels like we're running and leaves you feeling like wait, what the heck is going on here? They're just GUESSING at how to take it out? They only have 12 x-wings? That's their 'fleet?' No time for questions though, we have to go blow up the third Death Star! Yet ultimately it still all comes together. It's fun and rewarding throughout.
The biggest sins of this film, the ones that keep it from a 5 star in my personal opinion are two-fold:
1) We never get the big three reunion. I fully agree that the Sequel Trilogy needs to ultimately be the story of the new characters, and they absolutely gave us new characters that are instantly likable and easy to root for. I also totally expected Han Solo to die at some point in the ST, most likely Episode VII. Anyone who's anyone knew how Harrison felt Solo's end should be, and I'm okay with that too, but to kill him before he, Luke, Leia, Chewie, R2 and 3PO can be together? That is an unforced error.
2) Hitting the reset and creating basically a new Rebellion and a new Empire has the ultimate affect of negating all of the struggle of the previous 6 films. This story is not the most logical thread to follow after Return of the Jedi. All of these great characters and mysteries could easily be assimilated into a story that doesn't destroy the New Republic and restore the Empire as the ruling government, which thereby erases all of the hard-earned success of all of the characters who fought and struggled and sacrificed from The Phantom Menace all the way to Return of the Jedi. It is again, an unforced error. With a blank page before them, and literally hundreds of possible threads to pilfer from in the Extended Universe, it simply makes no sense to just revert it. 
But even with those drawbacks, TFA was still an absolute success. It wasn't necessarily the story that *I* was expecting or wanting, but it was absolutely 100% Star Wars. While it's not as original as it could or should have been, it is absolutely Star Wars in terms of fun, engaging characters, high stakes action and adventure, and I was highly excited to see how these characters developed and what challenges they would face in Episode VIII. Rey and Finn had obvious chemistry and connection, a bond that was supremely powerful particularly for Finn. Poe and Finn showed tremendous buddy potential, particularly to see how Finn would grow from someone who ran from the First Order and was primarily driven by fear and revulsion, to someone who was willing to sacrifice everything to help one person he'd connected to. How he dealt with his past promised to be a compelling component in Episode VIII. Kylo was fantastically primed as well. I couldn't wait to see how he and the Knights of Ren would either chase the Resistance or try to wipe out Master Skywalker and his new apprentice before they became as much a threat as Snoke declared they would be. I may not have cared for all of the aspects of how TFA got to its ending, I loved the ride an had great hopes of where it was pointing,"
"I grew up around the time the prequels finished up but I still watch the original trilogy. When I finally saw the prequels, I was so disappointed, they don't even begin to compare with the originals, and I feared that the same would happen with the sequel trilogy, there was hope because of I love J.J. Abrams as a director. This movie was actually really good, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and even a little more than I thought. I loved how Abrams found a way to bring back the classic characters and have them cross paths with our new heroes, it brings back the nostalgia and love of the original characters, Harrison Ford gives the best performance of this movie and it is so exciting to see him team up with Chewy once more, he has moved on with his life, but must now go back to Leia, and make amends, and he is very charismatic and as slick as ever, but you can also tell that he has seen some things, he has pain and loss, but he has covered it all up, he is a very human character who understands what it is like to lose everything, and his sacrifice at the end felt earned and it was just like Ford was saying it would be, a great emotional driving force for our heroes to continue fighting, it was achieved in a heartwarming scene of father and son and it really worked for me as the end of this beloved character. Daisy Ridley as the new main character was very interesting, I personally didn't think that she fit the role of the main character in a star wars movie, she didn't have very good charisma or charm, but she has potential with other projects, I loved learning about her backstory and her set up as to who she really is, but I didn't quite feel the emotional connection to her that I wanted to, she kind of felt trapped because she had been set up to reveal a lot of things, but we all knew that they wouldn't be answered in this movie. John Boyega gives a great performance as a stormtrooper who discovers that he is on the wrong side and he goes rogue, he is probably the best new character in terms of development and motivation, Boyega also has a very good American accent that works super well with his character, he goes on a personal journey in this film to discover himself and find a place to call home, he also works great with Han and Chewy, they constantly have little arguments with each other that is just so fun to watch. Oscar Isaac felt right at home in this one, he had so much fun and he fit the quirkiness of this universe perfectly, but even though I liked him a lot, I think that his character should have died when we all assumed that he died, they randomly brought him back right before the third act with no explanation as to how, I need some explanation and I don't think that I'm the only one. This was the first movie I ever saw Adam Driver in, and I will admit, when I first saw this movie, I was disappointed that he didn't look cooler, but upon rewatches, he is a very human character with violent fits of rage, he has a strong inner conflict that is preventing him from doing what is expected of him, I really have come to love Driver as an actor and I can safely say that he is my favorite new character of this trilogy. Carrie Fisher is just not the same as she used to be, granted she is very old in this movie, she just doesn't bring the same ferocity and righteous attitude that empowers women, I thought that it was great to see her again though, and for her to reconcile with Han. Captain Phasma was a super cool character who didn't get nearly as much screen time as I would've liked, and we don't know anything about her, but she has a funny scene about a trash compactor so...moving on. Domnahall Gleeson is very good, he fits the evil general who screams all of the time people, I was really impressed with his work in this film and hope that he gets more to do in the future. Snoke is very mysterious and creepy, I love that we only get shown just enough to make us interested in who he really is, Andy Serkis is the Mo-Cap god and is once again flawless here. The plot is so obviously just a New Hope so it is by no means unique, but it is very fun to experience. I loved seeing Takodana and meeting Lupita Nyongo's character, she was very good in this movie, and the battle over Takodana is some really good stuff. Starkiller Base feels like it just came out of nowhere, but everybody knew about it already, it looks awesome, but it's just a bigger death star that is only in this movie, I think that they should've talked about it a bit more and maybe had it survive until the next movie, but that's just my own opinion. I have a ton of fun watching this movie every time and I love the visual effects and actions sequences, it is just a thrill ride that is very entertaining, it does have it's narrative and character issues, but this film fits quite nicely into the Star Wars saga."
It started the new trilogy in a way i was excited about i loved Rey it was nice to see a female hero in star wars unfortunately there are many questions this movie leaves you with that don't get answered in the next film .
"Just one copy past of The new Hope, with worse actores and progressism, a shit"
Decent film... But kinda average
If you have forgotten the previous movies this one will remind you every bit. Not as original as it could have been but still very passable.
Rehash with some new energy
"Lack of creativity. The proper name for this movie is: ""The New Hope Reboot"""
"A messy copycat of Episode IV.
Georges LUCAS introduced a new dimension of each trilogy, politics in the I-II-III trilogy, journal of the Whills for the last one. Disney put it in the trash compactor for a Space ""Fast and Furious""."
"in 2015 when I first saw this movie I was fairly satisfied with it. I suppose I would have given in three and a half stars. Unfortunately Rian Johnson's dumpster fire, The Last Jedi has made everything in this movie irrelevant and has destroyed the integrity of the Disney Star Wars sequels. too bad, this used to be a decent movie."
"It's no better than previous Star Wars movies. Han Solo deserved a better death and Kilo is an evil laugh. Disappointed. Disney does not know what Force means, nor does it seem to know how important a lightsaber is. The movie is full of huge bugs."
"When I first watched the premiere at the Empire in London, I was stoked. I had terrible expectations, as the trailers made me think ""Is this a fan-film?""
I thoroughly enjoyed this film while I was watching it, but with every moment that passed outside the theatre, I had more and more misgivings. All of the plot points seemed eerily familiar and predictable. Finally I realised the film was a reboot of A New Hope. I didn't want the franchise to be rebooted and the Expanded Universe to be abandoned, but I was okay with it if we got a better sequel story. Unfortunately, I found the Force Awakens to be utterly lacing in creativity and setting up a story that was just more of the same. On top of that, my favourite EU content was from post-Episode VI. But now all of that time and era would be utterly wasted, as most memorable characters would have undoubtedly perished, due to the premise of this film. So I was not at all excited to read any of the new books or comics, because I knew were the journey would eventually lead us. But I was willing to wait and give the new trilogy a chance if the rest that followed and the new characters would end up enticing me more with the second installment. Unfortunately, they did not..."
New film with old story. Enjoyable at the end though.
"Had great potential however it felt too much of a parody to episode 4 a New Hope with many plot holes and unexplained events, unexplained characters,  vague character development.  The movie just felt convenient."
It's nostalgic !!!!!
"I recently re-watched this in preparation for the upcoming finale, and it's honestly still pretty good, even great at times, although quite derivative of the original 1977 classic. The characters are fun, the acting is joyous, and so many plot-threads and mysteries are set up to be explored (*sigh*), that I can genuinely still say that this is a once-in-a-lifetime type of film."
The feeling after watching this movie was similar to the loss of a very close family member.
A new Star Wars for the next generation
Just a remake of the first 3 with nothing original.
"It was fine, not great"
"I understand how some fans might feel this is A New Hope all over again, but I also understand how JJ Abrams paid homage to A New Hope and introduced Star Wars to a new generation. In that respect, JJ Abrams got it spot on. As a movie, it entertains. It has great action sequences that will live long in cinematic history, carries emotional weight, and a few new characters to fall-in-love with. On one end, Finn's character can sometimes be a bit annoying while at the other end, most fans will love BB-8."
"I was so hyped, but so disappointed..."
"Refrito del episodio 4, solo fue para crear nostalgia y sacar dinero"
It's a great look back on why we love that world. The movie do not reinvent to wheel but I enjoy it and was happy to see my self remembering why I love Starwars.
They pulled too many elements from the original trilogy instead of developing new characters and new character arcs.
"Take a horribly uncreative sequel, for example Hangover 2. All it is a nearly shot for shot remake of the first movie. A few cosmetic things are changed, but is the same basic formula. That is all the Force Awakens is. It is a retread of the first three Star Wars movies. You have a cantina scene, a ""I am your father"" scene, a ship flying through a trench scene, and even a death star blowing up scene! You have the first order which is identical to the empire. You have an emperor-like character in Snoke. You have a diminutive droid that speaks in beeps. You even have another mask-wearing villain with breathing issues! It is the same movie! This is nothing but member berries for the idiotic masses."
This whole trilogy is best ignored and forgotten
"This movie is so underrated. Beside being a totally fun adventure film and this is going to sound crazy but the sound was amazing. The way it looked combined with great sound made this one heck of a trip. The adventure takes you across the universe and explores new worlds. Lazer swords, spaceships and all other Star Wars perennials are present."
"Probably the most fun out of the Star Wars films. J.J Abrams definitely bought his film style... a rollercoaster film full of twists and turns and has mystery towards it. Yes, it does follow the story template of A New Hope a lot, but J.J needed to bring back the nostalgia back for old Star Wars fans and introduce to a new generation of fans and I'm okay with the story beats of A New Hope being used in this film. It doesn't linger on stuff for too long as it goes at an good pace. The humour lands 8/10. The use of new character like Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, Poe, BB-8  along with the old classics characters like Chewbacca, Han and Leia is fine, as it is focusing on bringing the new characters to the front. This is definitely Harrison Ford's best performance as Han Solo.  Although this is a fun Star Wars movie from beginning to end and with J.J Abrams direction, this doesn't quiet match the heights of ANH and TESB, but a fun movie."
The Force Awakens is the best Star Wars...... Lots of people disagree and that is ok it is just so fun
"A decent kick-off to the sequel trilogy, but focused too much on nostalgia and call-backs."
"Inspiring, adventurous, and emotional. Everything that a Star Wars movie should be!"
"Wow, this rehashed pot of ideas is just terrible. Maybe the characters are good. But it is not really a movie? It is just remember berries."
"Boring, lacks any substance"
"The first installment in the sequel trilogy is a fun, entertaining film which is full of twists and turns which will take you by surprise. This Star Wars movies strongest point is its ability to have pure fun. It's a non stop, fast moving adventure through space with lightsaber fights and a villain who will make you go 'That's evil!' And heroes which will make you cheer. It also has a brilliant group dynamic and some great friendships. Although this movie may be bursting with positives, some may argue it   has the same template as A New Hope, but this is not completely bad as that film is excellent. It is a very fast moving story so this could be seen as a positive and a negative. More action, less time to know a planet and certain characters. Overall it is a brilliant movie which, although is not the best movie in the world, will entertain you and cause reactions."
This movie broke the sequel trilogy before the opening words were finished.
Good on a technical level. The storry repeats itself. If this makes sence does not matter. A lot of ideas are copied from other star wars media like the map thing copied out of a star wars video game (kotor). But worse of course. The list goes on. Still a ok film i guess.
"Being the huge Star Wars fan that I am, I was very nervous and anxious for this film. It's safe to say that it lived up to my expectations and was one of my favorite movies of the franchise."
"A beat-for-beat remake of Episode IV, A New Hope, yet lacking any of the heart or soul of the original.  Jar Jar Abrams' ""mystery box"" approach to ""filmmaking"" has left us with yet another highly polished turd that may look and sound like Star Wars, but is nothing more than a cheap plastic knockoff."
"Alot of promising characters, but felt like a copy of ""A NEW HOPE"" way to much"
hope they would delete this movie from existence
"Все пластмассово. Невнятные герои. Бездарное использование величайшей киновселенной. Ноль сопереживания героям, даже к старичкам, таким как: Хан Соло - умер... пффф, и что."
"This movie copies Episode 4 in many key plot points, lending a feeling of unoriginality to it.  It is overall a good movie, however, and leaves you with strong anticipation for the sequel."
The force awakens is a good start the new trilogy from Disney with a few issues such as almost being a copy of a New Hope.
"JJ brought back Star Wars. The feel, the atmosphere and the story all felt like classic Star Wars. This film easily surpasses the sequels by going back to all that made the original trilogy great. The new characters, particularly Rey and Kylo, work perfectly and do not feel at all out of place when interacting with the original cast.
There's nothing groundbreakingly new here but what it did well was reintroduce Star Wars into the world of cinema perfectly. JJ set everything up nicely for the sequels to come."
"Not great, but decent. It was a mediocre Star Wars film. Not the best of the series."
"The Force Awakens is my second favorite Star Wars film. It set up the Disney trilogy so well, but sadly it was mishandled once JJ Abrams left. This movie is both fun and interesting. It feels like the only Disney Star Wars film that was made by someone who truly loves the franchise, and that is what I wish all of the Disney Star Wars films felt like. 

The criticism that this film is a rehash of A New Hope is true, though I argue that it is a better version of A New Hope. The action is exciting, the characters are interesting, and the plot lines that this film sets up are intriguing.

My Review: A"
"Typical paint the story by numbers script, no soul to the movie... truly terrible.

Do something new Mr Abrahams"
"Episode VII is a movie that if it wasn't a part of a sequel trilogy, you rate it maybe a 5/10. Considering this is following Return of The Jedi, Disney should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such a terrible movie to be publicly released."
"I expect a more creative premise from a Star Wars movie than just copying A New Hope. I understand that not everyone was a fan of the prequel movies, but at least George Lucas created a diverse galaxy for those movies. Not much I could compliment this movie for."
"Well made but in the end its just a bland clone of ""A New Hope"""
"Nada nuevo, un refrito para pasar el rato"
Garbage movie from a usually good director you know what they say get woke go broke.
Such a good star wars movie.
Star Wars The Force Awakens is a fun entertainment ride.
I actually liked the chemistry between Han Solo and the new kids. If the story had been more about him being a father figure to these two space orphans I may have enjoyed the movie more.
This movie was so good I enjoyed every minute of it
"Enjoyable movie at times but has a plot that we have already seen before in this franchise. The Force Awakens starts the sequel trilogy and sets up basically anything. which is just what jj wanted to do. Overall the plot is ok, the action is great, would recommend, But with a grain of salt as this is just a blockbuster with little heart."
Worst Star Wars ever.
One of the best movies ever How do people think this movie was not Eligible for fresh Like the saga Plus I think it's cool
"It's more like a fanfiction story than a canonical expansion to the franchise. The Force Awakens relies mostly on it's special effects and nostalgia for the older films, with lifeless main characters and a recycled plot."
"Everything Rey does that should be cool, feels unearned."
"And Star Wars goes...

""Bzzie...bzzzie...bzzziee""

""Roammm...roammmm...roaaammmm""

""Crash...Booom...Bang...""

Same old. Same old.

Why are people still watching this crap?"
"It's a meh, and its unneccesary."
"A solid opening to the Sequel Trilogy. One with nostalgia of the original, which happens to fit into the beginning of the new trilogy. With a new cast of characters, (and the old) come together in what would become the convoluting final (third) trilogy!"
Honestly have watched this over 5 times now and still baffles me how Disney would allow such a monstrosity of garbage to be released in the most profitable franchise in history. This movie killed Star Wars. They will have to remake this entire movie in 10 years for a redemption.
"Jar Jar Abrams did a reboot of A New Hope except that it sucked terribly.  This movie was the beginning of the end to a storied and epic franchise.  Disney should have taken Lucas's story instead of this garbage that brought us a 3rd Death Star.  Oh well, I guess we'll never know what could have been."
I really liked the movie in general. The design for kylo and snoke are really cool. For kylo it's especcialy his crossblade!
"Well, better than the Last Jedi.  It is basically 'A New Hope' retread replete with Death Star (but it is different because... it is bigger?)  The characters were not very interesting and one dimensional (Poe = 'a great pilot', Rey = 'mysterious past').  Finn kind of has an interesting introduction, but they never really do anything with his character.  Keep in mind too, part of what drives the Star Wars mythos is this weird dysfunctional family dynasty thing going on, and the only part of that that remains is Kylo Ren.
Other than that, it is basically a Star Wars movie.  Great visuals and CGI, weird aliens, Storm Troopers and space Nazis, stilted dialogue, the usual plot holes, a fair bit of nostalgia.  I would give it more stars, but I have seen Episode 8."
A good try but not one worth watching again.
Great movie as Disney and Lucasfilm brought back the Star Wars franchise for a start of a new trilogy.
A new hope remastered
"When I went to see the movie on it's debut, I was excited for a new era of Star Wars movie production. I walked out knowing that this whole story was a scene for scene script copy of Star Wars episode 4, but I was willing to give this revival the chance to give me a good experience as a Star Wars fan. The faith that I gave it was poorly returned.

The director of this movie was so uninterested in the franchise, that he gave the direction of the follow up to someone else, and the colossal failure of that movie only illuminated the flaws to this one, from the lazy story creation, one dimensional characters, and pacing that could be described as A.D.D."
"It's okay, but we need more skywalkers in it"
Decent start but is mostly a New Hope remake....
I'm not sure how this movie has such a good viewer score considering how flimsy the writing was...
"TFA was a good reboot of the franchise. It reclaimed the original Star Wars trilogy vibe more than the prequels and introduced some interesting new characters. Unfortunately, the Last Jedi then wastes them."
"Seemed like a repackaged ""New Hope"""
not the best. Like how Rey somehow defeats kylo ren
Good overall.  Does somewhat copy previous story line (i.e. another Death Star) but definitely got my excitement up for the next movie.   Decent characters and story and visuals with appropriate nods to the original cast.  CGI on the falcon alien scene was poor.
"This movie was not good at all, however after seeing the last jedi its not the worst ever star wars movie."
"Not without its flaws but with a cast of fresh, fun characters and some incredible special effects that brings Star Wars back to life. Loved it!"
"I loved the special effects, but mistakes are evident during the movie, and that is very annoying."
My Best Movie In 2015
"I loved this movie, and I loved it for two years afterwards. Unfortunately, since The Last Jedi shredded every thread this film left open, it retroactively made this film hollow and empty and worthless. The Disney Trilogy is dead now, Star Wars died in 2012, we just didn't know it yet. It's sad, I tried to like the Disney films, I tried hard, but they just made them so badly. I guess all good things come to an end, 35 years is a pretty good run honestly."
"Good, safe ""restart"" of the franchise. Finn's character was done a great disservice...a much better storyline was there for him, then he was turned into a coward."
"A return to what I love about Star Wars, with top-notch performances, characters, and a welcome return to the use of practical effects make this the best looking Star Wars film since the originals."
"Rey, Poe and Finn are the new trio in this very well paced, high quality directed Star Wars feature by JJ Abrams and co-written by Lawrence Kasaden. A welcomed great new edition and direction with those same classic star wars themes. The scope and scale along with the amazing original star wars feel and editing felt as effortless and organic as the newly forged frienships of this trio and the original. Seeing General Leia again was awesome.  Kylo Ren is magnificent as the grandson and next wannabe immater of Darth Vader. There are no words to put in proper context for how much I've missed Han Solo and Chewbaca back on the millienium falcon! My only issues were with the character Maz Kanata and with Snoke, and lastly I wasn't too happy with a giant planet mirroring the deathstar called Starkiller base. One of the greatest cliff-hangers though of all-time happened to me at the end of this film, revealing Luke Skywalker. I will always remember that great feeling of seeing him out standing on the ocean sea cliffs pulling back his Jedi robed hood and seeing Rey extend, holding out his lightsaber to him. That is an indelible all-time happy moment for me and I will treasure that forever."
"I haven't seen the previous movies of the so-called original saga, but this movie is not so bad and it attracted me to the Star Wars world."
"This is a garbage film. Disney clearly wanted to make a retread of the original Star Wars film because it would be safe financially. But the story makes no sense, in terms of continuity from Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi."
"The beginning of the end of one of the best movie franchises ever made. Disney doesn't know what they are doing, which is really sad, but at least this one is better than the following movie, that one was much, MUCH worse, somehow.

This is just really bad."
"Go watch Star Wars: A New Hope, and you've seen this 100% rip-off movie."
"More of the same, the last 2 minutes will be worth it."
a good Star Wars movie that gave me hope for the franchise up until I saw The Last Jedi.
Great movie with some slight flaws that's easy to overlook. Even after I know TLJ ruins everything TFA sets up I still love this film.
"You can buy George Lucas' company, but you can't buy his creativity and his storytelling. The actors - old and new - were wonderful, but this is basically 'A New Hope' with a more ambiguous plot line and a lot of smoke and mirrors."
The begining of the end of Star Wars
Needs a better director. should of been about the Yuuzhan vong.
No explanation of any plot holes. A complete mess of a story
"A poor clone of the original Star Wars film, without the character chemistry and sadly dominated by political narrative. Some nice visuals and sci-fi action fun, but a very dire direction for this once epic franchise."
"Horrible, by far the worst Star Wars film of the saga, no creativity, They made the same movie as A new hope, Disney should hang their heads in shame...."
"If I were going to rank this film against the others in the main story arc, I would put it at a tie with The Phantom Menace with only The Last Jedi sucking a larger, veiny member. This was a very derivative, unoriginal plot. Nothing about it improves on the prior films, which it rips off in whole. Worst...episode...ever (just kidding the next film- The Last Jedi is much worse than this one)"
"A garbage movie, but could have been saved with a good sequel to explain all the set ups. But unfortunately, the sequel was even worse."
Ugh... not again. The money hungry movie industry has once again spoiled a beloved name just to turn a profit. They have also stepped up to the ridiculous Hollywood standard of making everything about feminist plot lines and destroying any semblance of respect for these new movies coming out. But all in fair in the name of money and SJW agendas I guess.
"Fairly good, it's set up meant the rest of the trilogy had potential."
"This honestly, was a very well made flick. J.J Abrams knocked it did in the park! This film is definitely a classic in my book."
"Mediocre movie, they could've done so much more with Rey, and the plot could've at least have major differences from A New Hope's plot, but it is fundamentally the same, I would like to give Rey more background, so they could at least explain her abilities."
As good a sequel could have been. Great new characters and protagonist.
The following movie is even worse then this piece of garbage.
Was not bad but pretty much Episode 4 all over
"Star Wars? More like Plot Hole Wars, The Prequels vs Mary Sue Sequels"
"Total waste of time, ruined my childhood, thanks disney"
jar jar Abrams cloned a new hope and passed it off as his. typical jar jar abrams
"As many people said, this is rehash of Episode IV: A New Hope in may aspects, but at least it's better than The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones, this film is really good, I had not very high standards for this movie but when I watched this, it was pretty good. I'ma give this film a B."
"It was a really good movie I loved finn, Rey, and Poe I love how the ending played out with Luke I liked kylo ren but i didn't care about han's death but all in all it was a good movie"
"garbage, pretty bad and desapointing"
"I was so pumped to see this film before it came out! Star Wars is my childhood and this movie brought back everything we loved about the original trilogy. The actors did a great job. The writing and direction were really well done. Even though it kinda recycles some of the stuff from A New Hope, it did it in a way so it's original and not a copy. This is a must-see!!"
"It's not an outstanding film, but it does have its place in the Star Wars Saga."
"very bad movie, no imagination"
"I made this account just to comment on the tragedy that is Disney's rights to star wars. Kathleen Kennedy is a completely incompetent elitist that doesn't care about star wars and blatantly shames those that are critical of her crappy handling of the series. She cares about making money and propagating third wave feminism and terrible, terrible. jokes. She is a shameful, jealous, money hungry cow that has totally destroyed star wars. This garbage is not star wars. I hope one day a skillful party will take the reigns of star wars and re-create sequels post episode 6. I am sure that George Lucas gets royalties for original characters and that is why Disney is slaughtering OGs (solo, pathetic weak luke, xtra strange Leia that gets sucked into space then flies around like superman........ wtf?) This is not star wars my friends, don't accept it as such."
Same as always. Nothing original
"Boring CGI fight scenes, boring story, boring characters, Mr Lucas please take back star wars and start over from the beginning, start fresh, because episode 7 and 8 are trash!"
Just a copy and paste of the 4th film's plot.
"It's so horrible I returned to my home at 3 am and watched Episode 5 to clean my soul and eyes. The super-humans-jedis-ladies and the super-loosers-boys is becoming rule in hollywood, it's a shame such ideology-crap spet in the audience..."
"It's a remake, not a sequel."
"Enormously fun and enormously nostalgic, with a smooth-flowing plot, a great cast, great special effects and great surprises, I thoroughly enjoy and highly recommend Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens."
Everything rehashed and bland. Unwatchable from the moment they get to Millenium Falcon. I simply cannot focus or resist falling asleep trying to watch this.
"Woke Wars... Disney really fucked that one up. Can somebody please bomb that stupid mouse to Nirvana? Bad cast, bad story. This movie will be forgotten in 10 years."
"Not the best, but enjoyable."
"The movie as a whole is not completely terrible, but it is not original enough to be worth watching over and over. There are too many recycled plot points that mirror the original movies that came before it. At the end of the day it is a soft remake that is worth watching, just to see what comes next."
I really liked this sequel. they managed to pull it off. Even if it seems like the original all over again.
"Only a well ""copy and paste"" of the ""A New Hope""."
"This film basically replicates ""A New Hope"" plot point for plot point. Take out the people and place names, and I guarantee you couldn't tell the difference. The only substantial difference is that ""A New Hope"" was a genre-defining epic while this film is an uninspired political brow-beating."
"Undoes most of the rules set by previous movies, for better or worse"
Not great. Worth streaming at home maybe. Maybe
Nice going Jar Jar Abrams!
"Some might say this is just A New Hope with new people, I say its a ton of fun with impressive visuals and the undoubtedly lovable Rey."
The most expensive fan film ever made. It did vividly revealed the genius of George Lucas...because it's absence from this film was glaring.
"While it is perhaps overly similar in terms of plot when compared to a new hope, it still holds up with incredible characters both new and old. This is an awesome movie filled with astounding scenes and my personal favorite performance from Harrison Ford as the half witted scruffy looking nerf herder, Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan Solo"
"I rewatched this recently and was pleasantly surprised. I remember being angry at it, and disappointed when I first saw it. Now less so - I understand it more. I feel inspired by characters that I can identify with, something that never happens in sci-fi/fantasy/superhero films. Not five stars because there just aren't enough beautiful shots - I don't think the director had any artistic ambition, which the old trilogy was full of. For me that's the most important thing. In its absence, four stars for the cool characters and medium good plot."
I liked the new characters but didn't see the point into making Han into an absentee father and Luke a coward who runs away.  I did like seeing the Falcon again
its juts a bad copy of the original.
Harrison Ford seemed to be in a good mood.
"The Force Awakens doesn't shine but it's for sure nice first chapter for this new trilogy, capable of giving some good ""original trilogy vibes""  to all of us."
"Sets up The Last Jedi nicely, didn't like how powerful Rey was or how ineffectual Kylo Ren was against her, no one likes a toothless villain. But The Last Jedi should be good becuase we finally get to see the greatest hero or all time, Luke Skywalker! Plus the excitement of finding out Rey's origins and also all about the Mysterious Snoke! The Last Jedi should be really really good!! Oh... wait. Ok, one star for this film too then. *shrugs*"
"Ooh Disney, try this for a title ""A New Hope (Now With Annoying Characters And Better Effects.) Well it's a two star rating mostly because it's not as bad as the latest one."
Poorly done rip off of original film
"the characters except Han and Chewbacca felt boring and uninspiring, the main premise of the film is unoriginal and a complete copy and paste from the original star wars film. but it had great special effects, the action was good, the acting is good and it's a not bad welcome for the new generation of star wars fans"
Star Wars: Episode VII: The Force Awakens is great.
"Not as good as Rogue one or the original trilogy, not as awful as the prequels or TLJ. Force Awakens may not be a masterpiece, but it's still a good movie"
"For the first installment into the new trilogy I was left wanting so much more. The Force Awakens recycled most of a new hope with a few updates. I'm disappointed that Disney did not really expand the Universe of Star Wars in any significant way. (SPOILER) The NEW Empire is fighting the OLD Rebellion (the Rebellion that I thought had won, but I guess I was mistaken). Everything looks the same as we had left it, and I can't for the life of me understand why. I think Disney was playing it far too safe, which they did not need to. Give us new story, with all the twists and turns, don't be afraid to touch on new issues. Though I have to say the effects, both practical and digital were incredible, a nod to those teams and what they accomplished."
This is basically The New Hope with different heroes. And it is extremely hard to like any of them. Basically only Fin have the characters arc.
One of the worst movies ever made.  It was like a five year old wrote it.
Nice try but No. Bad copy of the original Star Wars.
The Farce continues.  Only 3 Star Wars movies have ever been filmed: episodes IV - VI.
Disgusting and offense to REAl fans
"I was rewatching the movie, and it honestly is a big disappointment. from plot points that were illogical through poor character development, it's a shame this movie ended up the way it did."
Esse filme é um retorno imenso pra saga!
Waste of time. Cannot recommend.
"The scenario of this movie is a copy paste from star wars IV : it is a versy secure and predictable movie with no surprise. In short, this is the opposite of what a star wars film is supposed to be : creative, surprising, inventing, innovating, both visually and technically."
"My 7r old son and I saw The Force Awakens on opening night. As we were driving home from the theater, I asked him what he thought. His response was "" we've seen this story before"". He's a child. No one at Disney similarly questioned the parallel storytelling as this film was being made? No one, seriously? Not even when they filmed Unkarr Plutt losing an arm in Maz's bar? Ponda Baba anyone? At least they cut that scene, but seriously, have JJ and Disney lost their collective mind? The fact that they considered making that scene tells me that The Force Awakens is barely more than a parody.

How many jokes does one need to make about the power of Chewies' bowcaster? And how likely is it that after working together for 3 decades, that Han has never fired it before?

I do not understand how - as a fan - JJ Abrams would think after waiting decades for new Star Wars film content that the best narrative was to simply retell New Hope and through the course of the film's few developments make the achievements of Luke, Darth Vadar's and the Rebellion's sacrifices in Return of the Jedi null and void. It is shocking how out of touch he and Kathleen Kennedy are with the audience that has followed this mythology since '77 and whose children they are now trying to endear to the franchise. Stay true to the material/mythology that you have christened cannon and stop treating the audience as if they aren't intelligent enough to appreciate a rich narrative. Could someone on the Lucas Story Group please step up?"
"naaah, could have become a good movie, many maybe good ideas, but they never got thought further, so all the excitement you have after watching this movie becomes a appointment quite fast..."
"The first movie of the sequel trilogy does not disappoint with great action and characters, being very similar to ""A New Hope"" with its general plot while not feeling like a straight-up copy, 10/10."
"Less than good.  Terrible storytelling, boring performances, and a completely stupid plot."
The Beginning of the end of a great franchise.
Really great movie with a fun storyline.
"JJ is Star Wars dirty the same way he destroyed Star Trek. It was nice to see some characters return, but it's difficult to care about a story that, even for a Star Wars movie, that seems to hold its own canon and even rules it itself sets out in utter contempt. The cast is also incredibly flat, and I struggled to connect with any of the characters. It feels like the viewer is supposed to root for the protagonists just 'because.' It watches like episode 4 being remade as a Disney theme park attraction."
"I used to like this film. episode 8, THE LAST JEDI, by heretic Rian Johnson ruined it all though. Skipping episode 9, and anything else non-George-Lucas. I gave this film 4.5 stars before TLJ came out. Can't watch it now though. Gives me a stomach ache. Terrible atrocity TLJ was; a national tragedy!"
"This is a good film! Sure it takes familiar plot points from previous Star Wars films, but who cares.. Those films were awesome! This was always going to be hard continuing the story and I think they did a great job, it felt like Star Wars, it looked like Star Wars and a pretty decent storyline was set up for the final trilogy. Shame about the next one being so terrible, this film gave it a lot of potential. (Director change ruined the next film)"
"Within 15 minutes i knew it was ""A new hope 2"". I hope they do better with episode 9. 8 was not needed either."
"It was visually stunning but emotionally shallow and contradicts Star Wars canon, not to mention copy pasting A New Hope over and over again. It feels more like a rehash or reboot of Star Wars than the 7th episode in a Saga. Saddest thing is it brings nothing new regarding planets and species, its all been done before and been done better by Lucas either in OT or PT movies. As a standalone, sure, its good, but its not the first SW movie, is it? A little bit more originality, more taking risks and sticking to canon mythology of how the Force works would have made this movie great. Overall its average at best, 2 stars in my book."
"Not a bad reboot, a bit of a regurgitation or it's former elite."
Not awful but not good either. A rehash story of original story with some obvious difference yet some how felt like they dumb down movie for younger audience.
I gues was watching a reprise of New Hope.
"It cashes in on nostalgia, and in doing so fails to be its own narrative. Supporting characters, with important roles and no backstory. It is a missed opportunity to reunite beloved characters and continue the story. It ultimately came across as a two hour long commercial for toys."
Just a rehash of the previous movies. Zero originality.
"We were promised a new movie, but Disney delivered a bad remake assembled with recycled parts from the previous films. Star Wars VII is awful."
"fun, actioned packed, fast paced adventure, although a copy of a new hope, a  movie that everyone will enjoy"
Bland rehash of a much netter film. Poor treatment of the OT with new characters that are one dimensional and stale. Lazy design work and effects. A horrible entry in the series.
Not at all what I expected and certainly not what the franchise deserved.
Such potential so much waisted.
"I loved this movie, wasn't perfect though. I didn't like that Rey is from a desert planet, way too overdone. I also didn't like that Rey was able to defeat Kylo Ren but atleast Kylo was injured as an excuse. I loved that snow forest sequence, I loved all of the Kylo scenes, opening scene was awesome, best opening to Star Wars movie. I wish the Falcon was no longer in use, it's been too long and it's purely fan service at this point. Snoke was very cool and intimidating, it's stupid that the Rathtard ate everyone else immediately but just carried Finn along extra long for plot armor. We definitely didn't need another Death Star (Star Killer Base) I mean seriously wtf. I don't like how there isn't enough evolution in ship designs. They're basically just rehashes of the OT with different colors and slightly different looks but for the most part rehashes. This movie did a lot of great things but also failed to push the boundaries much, it played things too safe a lot of the time. However, Kylo murdering Han Solo is something I'm very happy about, that's the type of daring-ness I'm excited/satisfied about."
"The most unoriginal movie I've ever seen. The plot was a copy paste job, but they forgot to involve the new characters in some development."
Crazy how so many fake and bought accounts have been made to boost up stats on this crap movie hopefully rise of skywalker is actually good and deserves good ratings
too many unnecessary fan service
WORST STAR WARS MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN UP TO THAT POINT I HATED IT RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE IF YOUR NEW TO STAR WARS DO NOT WATCH ANY OF THE THE MOVIE MAID BY DISNEY JUST WATCH EPISODES 1-6 AND END IT THERE!!!!!!!!
The film has its moments but it's not at Lucas level.
"A bad start to the sequel trilogy. Although the performances and special effects are phenomenal the story is exactly the same as the original movie which is a million times better than this, it's primarily worth a watch just to see what they'll do with this new trilogy."
"Okay, so they could throw anything into a wet paper sack and call it Star Wars and I would like it, but. This film really captures, for me at least, the magic of episode 4. Being a middle aged man, I say this is the next generations Star Wars. I loved it."
"A good start with a lot of potential to explore some interesting aspects. A carbon copy of A New Hope but having said that, it is a passable Star Wars film. A few errors in Han's death and the waste of Phasma and Kylo, as well as Rey being amazing at everything w no explanation, but is miles better than The Last Jedi."
Overrated.  Why would just remake the first film??? All that opportunity wasted.  Once you get past the flashy visuals you start to wonder.  Finn is possibly the only shining light but even he started to get annoying.
JJ Abrams screwed this franchise up. Star Wars is a dead franchise.
"It had some good potential, some interesting characters, thought it would lead to a better next movie.... how wrong I was."
"Shallow story, weak antagonists and confusing status quo. Jar Jar Abrams is a gera-te director but here is where the Franchise started to die. The new characters (from the light side of the force) are what this movie has best, Poe, Rey and Fin deserved a better writing, like us fans."
This is a awesome movie to watch i recommend you watch it you will be missing out if you do not  watch it and a great way to start the sequel trilogy.
As time has gone by i have grown to like it less because it has little depth but still a great movie
The only good part of the movie was Finn and he was reduced to a side piece
"I love this movie, it brought back the feelings of the original trilogy something that even though I like them the prequels didn't. Rey is a interesting character, someone who reminds us of our favorite moisture farmer turned Jedi while also being her own interesting character. Finn is great too a stormtrooper deserter not really looking to help the resistance but watch out for Rey the first person to treat him like a person, and Poe a great pilot with the charisma of Han Solo, Han and Chewie are well Han and Chewie and are always a welcome. Great addition to the Star Wars mythos and I can't wait to see how the trilogy and saga ends."
Jar Jar abrams is a hack and it shows in this fan fiction star wars movie.
"I'm gonna be honest I quite enjoyed this movie when it came out it never matched the prequels or the sequels but it was good to get that Star Wars feeling in a movie.

However the backbone of this movie was very weak leading to the god forsaken sequel.

It set up hope however I was disappointed to find Han Solo dead in the first episode and many gaping wide plot holes like Finn using a lightsaber skillfully and Rey being so skilled at everything.

It very much seemed a clone of A New Hope yet I never minded that fact because it brought back the nostalgia of that movie. I didn't like the First Order as it seemed too distant from the Empire; an Imperial Remnant could've done better.

I didn't like how Kylo Ren looked very similar to Revan or how the Resistance was just a re-paint of the Rebel Alliance. This movie just spat in the face of Return of the Jedi offering no character progression for the original characters especially in contrast to 'The Thrawn Trilogy' we never see Han become respectable, Leia rebuild the Republic or Luke train to become a jedi master.

So to summarise this movie had many things wrong with it yet it was overlooked by the Star Wars feel it was very mediocre in terms of what it brought to the table but it was a good (but not great) movie."
"Basically a clone of ""A New Hope"". I mean was it entertaining?Sure. Not really fond of Mary Sue, or the death of 1 of the main characters."
"It's so disappointing that this became the continuation of the Star Wars saga as Force Awakens is an unoriginal rip off of A New Hope. It makes you wonder if it warranted being made at all, but I suppose it tells the same story to a new generation of audiences who don't want to watch some old trilogy that began in the 70s. It isn't all that bad. Visually it is beautiful and the special effects are as realistic as can be, but for the showy effects it lacks a compelling narrative. Disney really could have made a classic that rivaled the best of the original trilogy but falls short despite J.J. Abrams handling of the directors chair. The cast does alright for their parts but the stand outs are the characters we already know and love, Chewbacca, Carrie Fisher as Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo. This is a movie I certainly have a love/hate relationship for. It makes you wish that Lucas had been heavily involved sometimes because regardless of the prequels at least it was coming from the creator who had a vision. The Force Awakens lacks vision and when compared to A New Hope, episode 4 beats out episode 7 every time."
A joke and a disrespectful movie towards the public. Boring and poor acting. Ewoks had better facial expressions than those new actors...
Pure and simple copy of a New Hope.
"A decent addition to the Star Wars franchise. Though a bit of a rehash of New Hope, it is a film that introduces some wonderful new characters to the galaxy that we know and love with nostalgia sprinkled through out."
"Being a ""newbie"" in this franchise I can say that this was the movie that I most enjoyed until now."
"A new hope sort of, but good star wars adventure story."
"Hard workers for sure! Very impressive amid a lot of red tape and differing opinions, to bring a large and expensive movie to the theaters. Unfortunately the film does not suspend disbelief and the audience is very aware of the confusion :("
Back when people thought this trilogy was going to be good
"You can tell that this was rushed by the studio. Also, the movie did a terrible job setting up a strong antagonist - Kylo is a crybaby who gets bested in battle by the protagonists ... pretty lame for the first of a trilogy (so much for a heroes journey!)."
I think this movie very well moved Followed on from the original trilogy and even as its own film it is great it also opens up a gateway for the sequel trilogy my main problem with this movie is that the Star Wars franchise has showed us before that lightsabers are a Jedi weapon and they take time to learn to use but in this movie fin just picks one up and automatically knows how to use it
"Again, lackluster and lazy storytelling, creating a new hope 2.0 and failing to have a creative mind."
worse version of a new hope
The space adventures of Mary Sue
"movie with bad script, has no real connection with the mystical meaning of force, it is more a movie for children than for tasters of the original saga."
"If this was a stand alone movie or the beginning of Star Wars I would have been more pleased and added two stars to my rating. However seeing that it is part of a saga and that it completely ripped off a new hope in every single part of its plot I think it was a rip off and it isn't really even a Star Wars  movie to me. The old characters I loved from the OG trilogy kinda sucked in this film and Kylo was a flop of a villain. Music was excellent, cinematography was exceptional, and the action was decent, plot sucked, characters kinda sucked, and acting was average."
"Pretty much a rehash of a new hope but with female lead who is bad at nothing rammed down our throat. She has no personality and I cannot relate to her not having to work to get good at anything. From being able to use the force at will to teaching Han to fly the falcon the message to young girls is ""you are amazing at the everything and this will work out"". Finn at least develops a little from a scared pussy cat terrified of pretty much everything to lifting the light sabre to go against REN. Totally outmatched and fights until the end - finally we can relate before Mary Sue get up and uses the force and without and training takes Ren out. Either Ren is a terrible bad guy with no skill or Mary Sue is just a terrible good guy. Either way the series is in trouble. The music and sound effects were spot on and I enjoyed all the visuals."
"Great movie with some top notch acting from Driver, Boyega and Daisy Ridley - can't wait to see them in future movies!"
"Should be used in film school as case study on how to repackage nostalgia and make a ton of money. Good popcorn movie, but alas utterly forgettable and ultimately irrelevant as opposed to the original source material."
"This was horrible. Me and a homie of mine went to see this on opening night and there was little to nobody there. The movie was so filled with holes in the story I could park a Bentley Contential and 2 Gen 1 Hummers in it. I had hope this would make me love the franchise more than I already had. it did the opposite. It killed the love I had for it. And as I think back to the movies that came afterwards, I have no confidence or faith in Disney's directory role in the franchise. In short, if you really want to see this, just look at the movie for free online. Save that money for something else."
terrible liberal SJW nonsense
"The first Star Wars movie I ever experienced in theaters turned out better than I thought it'd be, it's actually a great movie"
"The writing was completely childish. The main character Rey was handed everything, the Falcon, Anakins Lightsaber, the force. Not to mention she easily beat someone who was trained by the two most powerful beings."
Failed attempt to recreate ''A new Hope''. It's just... Rey... I can't smell that kind of character writing... so bad...
This is a good movie with interesting new characters.  Not perfect but Hollywood has put out lots of garbage so maybe I'm becoming easily impressed. Definitely a watch.
"Not necessarily a horrible film, but the damage it does to precious Star Wars canon is why it deserves such a low rating. A horrible follow up to Return of the Jedi, and a shitty plagiarization of A New Hope. JJ Abrams is a hack and shouldn't be allowed to work on existing franchises ever again"
Cheap corporate popcorn filler
A great remake of a new hope .
No imagination whatsoever.
Dont listen to the butt hurt fanboys. Great Star Wars entry.
"Movie was everything that I would expect out of a modern SW movie.  Some of the actors were a little bit off throughout, but the special effects were beautiful."
"Let's face it. Legends is a much better continuity. Jacen will always be better than Ren, and Jaina will always be better than Rey. There were so many messed up things, including Luke only being in the movie for 10 seconds, the plot holes, it's a rip-off of A New Hope, Phasma is underused and shuts down the shields on Death Star 3 for no reason, Rey is overpowered, Han's Original Trilogy arc is destroyed, There is no world building, The New Republic doesn't even have a military and we don't ever find out their relationship with The First Order or the Resistance, and the Original Trilogy apparently happened for no reason. This movie is just one big, high Budget, politically correct fan fiction. DON'T EVEN MENTION THE LENS FLARES."
Just wish it was better.
"It was fine, but brought nothing new."
This was a well-made movie that seems to appreciate the original material. JJ is a fantastic director and he captured the essence of Star Wars with this film. It had similarities to A New Hope but I'm on board with where they're going. JJ needs to helm all three of the films in the trilogy so they follow the same vision.
Best Star Wars so far
After the excitement of having a new Star Wars movie abated. It was just a rehash of the original.  I do not know a lot of the extended universe books and comics but the more I read the better it sounds. It was still Star Wars.  My problem with this was that it was nothing new.  Also Rey had no story arc what's so ever.  She was perfect... no flaws... and this is not a good thing.  Also made Han Solo and absentee dad who ran out on his family. Didn't he spend the original three movies growing in the opposite direction as a character? In the extended universe Han and Leia actually had a good marriage.. Can't that happen anymore in our current culture or is that against forced expectations.
A remake of A New Hope but with a female lead who is better at everything than everybody else. Significantly better than the Last Jedi but nowhere near the quality of the original three films.
"A good watch, true to form but rehashes a lot of previous material. Interesting new characters, looking forward to seeing their development. I hope the next movie takes a darker, more serious tone and fleshes out all the new main characters."
Mediocre. Could have really shined with a plot line that wasn't a direct parallel to Episode 4. The protagonist is the luckiest character in the franchise since R2D2.
Well recived at first but now that ep 8 is out shows the poor character development and waste of the iconic ones
"It's not what Star Wars fans were expecting, but still offers compelling story, although it lacks a good protagonist."
It's a fun ride if you have never seen a star wars film before. Also great to see our heros again. However its basically a remix of a New Hope. But still fun.
Terrible movie that started the end of Star Wars with poor character development.
"Up there with the worst movies I've ever seen. The characters were unlikable, the script unoriginal, and the shameless attempts at nostalgia, forgettable."
"I was hoping for a sequel, not a remake of the original. Bummer. It's good for those unfamiliar with Star Wars."
"When J.J. Abrams gets to flex his directorial muscles an absolute blast. Smartly taking cues from Miyazaki and Spielberg (the animation and greatest live action director of all time). He did the impossible and proved that after the prequels it was still possible to make a movie that feels exactly like the original trilogy. While the prequels were very action packed the original trilogy was not, particularly the first two, they were adventure movies first and foremost and adventure is sold on plot, locations and atmosphere. Even though action and adventure seem like a perfect fit together, they actually usually work against each other (think about why all the Zelda games have such simple combat and why Devil May Cry has such simple environments), but a few particular movies have found the perfect balance, and while I wish with all my heart I could say this was one of them, it isn't. While the first act has tons of incredible ideas, the rest doesn't expand upon them in any way, it just goes through the motions of a worse version of A New Hope."
Really fun. But Rey is WAY to powerful. A staff is not even close to a single bladed lightsaber and the force has lost all of its importance.
Felt like a remake of a new hope but still left a lot of open ended questions and left me excited for a sequel
"One of the greatest Star Wars movies, it has everything, AWESOME effects, GREAT character development, beautiful writing and perfect action scenes. I love the lightsaber fight scenes, they were so badass. Kylo Ren is such a good character, you can feel his struggle with the light and the dark. Han Solo is great too, we got to know him way better than in the original thrilogy. I really like this movie, you should watch it for what it is, a new chapter in the same universe that doesn't turn down what made the original thrilogy awesome!"

"A re-hash of hope for the right reasons, whilst being view-able in its own right. Recommend!"
"Outside of the nostalgia and excitement factor, the film doesn't offer a lot in terms of an interesting or original story. The acting is excellent, and the cinematography is out of this world. The new characters felt intriguing and the old ones fit in just about right. The comparisons to A New Hope, however, will never not be noticeable."
It's a great fun movie the start of what I thought was going to be a really cool trilogy unfortunately the second one of the trilogy has ruined them for me
"This movie could be seen as a mere copy of Episode IV, and it has several flaws that might make some people dislike it. Even so, TFA managed to be a very solid film, as well as a promising introduction to the sequel trilogy. Sadly, all of its potential went to hell after the release of TLJ."
"A rehash of the previous movies, but since I liked the previous movies, I didn't mind that. 🤷‍♂️"
"Great movie! Rey is no mary sue, but a brilliant and somewhat mysterious character. I knew it would be her!"
Wasn't the start amazing start to a new great Star Wars trilogy that fans hoped it would be.
An epic return to the series. re-establishing beloved characters as well as introducing us to new characters.
"Good movie. Nice to revisit the characters from the original trilogy. Not happy about Han's fate. Apparently anyone can use a lightsaber and defeat a first order, Sith, Jedi, warrior who has had years of training. Best character is BB-8."
No longer under the guidance of George Lucas the Star Wars saga is less of character driven cinematic masterpiece paying homage to 1930's and 40's serials and more of your standard popcorn. Definitely run of the mill. Disney and Co. did not take the necessary time to develop a proper Star Wars film. The results will show in the future.
Do not like it at all
"Sure, it's a rehash of A New Hope, but it's a lot of fun. Rey and Finn have good chemistry. Great to see Han, Leia, and company back on the big screen."
"Hard to describe how bad this was.  Writing was limp, characters were shallow, story was indecipherable.  Good production value for what felt otherwise like a SNL sketch about Star Wars."
It was ok. No great character reunion. Not much explanation as to why or how the bad guys are still in control. The new characters seem flat and undeveloped. Too bad the love between Han and Leia just fizzled out?
"This film was "" A New Hope"" all over again......."
Shallow characters messed up old characters and introduced new hyperspace suicide !!!! Right until the end I was hoping for something good but it just wasn't the
"Lets ignore what made episodes 4 and 5 and then double down on the forced marketing crap of episode 6. I get it, you have issues with Star Wars saga and the generation in which it was written, but this is more of a temper tantrum by a spoiled brat with an unlimited budget than an attempted rewrite let alone a continuation of the story. An honest artist would have just started with a whole new cast of characters, this was just vengeance."
It was a star wars film
A remake of a New Hope. Enjoyable.
Basically a shot for shot remake of a new hope only worse
has the star wars spirit!
"Not worth the 2 hours and 15 minutes of life you have to trade in to pretty much wacth a parody of the new hope, sad, disappointing, great cast, bad director"
A wasted opportunity to create a new story. The new heroes and villains are not well developed.
"Terrible movie, bad storyline, bad acting."
I saw this with my roomate. One of his friends were sitting behind us. Its pretty special to go to the movies with people. I  remember the crowd cheering when hon solo or princess laya first appeared.
"JJ did a great job, really feels like star wars."
Star Wars episode IV retooled. Didn't really progress the STAR wars universe in an interesting way
"A movie with excelent execution, we get to see new and returning faces, the script Is perfect."
"I love this film, Enjoyable to watch than the Last Jedi. It was like a new hope. It is one of my favorite films of Star Wars."
"I am not sure about what to say about this movie. I have not watched it because it is so predictable. Only stupid people like movies with predictable ending and a lot of CGI. I think the critics who left a comment saying that this is a good movie, they should really consider buying a new brain and think seriously about what makes a great movie. I said since day one, that this new trilogy will be crap, and there it is. I understand now, why Trump is in power in USA when i see how so many people liked this stupid movie"
"Familiar, yet exiting, The Force Awakens is a solid first entry in the sequel trilogy"
Just okay as stand alone Film. But a Bad Star wars Film
"some star wars fans are the actual worst. namely the ones who freak out when they realize people have different opinions than them.

just want to point that out."
"Deth of legend. Deth of legendary series, story and universe"
"I really like this movie, it's very enjoyable."
"I cannot understand the high ratings for this movie. The dialog was awful, the plot was nonsensical, the pacing was uneven, the fan service was insulting, the humor fell flat most of the time, and the writing was just lazy and sloppy. I didn't think it possible, but somehow the writers, directors, and producers of Episode VII have managed to make me look back on the prequels with nostalgia."
This movie was absolutely amazing I absolutely loved it so much so good I definitely recommend it and I 100% mean this this gets an A+
I really enjoyed this movie.
Good star wars movie.
The Original is better
I can't believe all Star Wars fans were duped into thinking Disney and hack JJ would actually have some new ideas to inject into the Star Wars franchise.
A great start to the new trilogy...
I sure miss the original trilogy. This was fun. But at the end it struck me how much of this was just copy/pasted from part IV.
"So much Hope destroyed...
A bad remake of the film Star Wars, a New Hope..."
The first of a brand new Star Wars saga even we as fans have hoped for. It's truly one of my favorite Star Wars movies. While it;s kind of the same thing like a New Hope I still enjoyed all the brand new stories to it.
Did not follow the books.
"Deserves zero stars for this ""A New Hope"" remake."
"Tell me, is General Hux, the absolutely worst general in the history of generalship.  Harrison Ford saved this movie."
Disney is going to ruin this franchise.
"JJ Abrahams is doing what everyone expected from him on the best side. He puts new blood and lots of adrenaline into the old movie series based on the brainchild of George Lucas. Together with Lawrence Kasden, one of the original screenwriters of the series, and Michael Arnett, Oscar-winner for Little Miss Sunshine and one of ""Toy Story"" screenwriters, they manage to create a compelling new plot that faithfully continues the story of Han Solo , Princess Leia and of course Luke Skywalker.
The length of the film is 136 minutes, but time flies with a wealth of breathtaking battles that manage to keep the viewer enthralled on the chair in suspense, and the humor that makes the audience laugh. In general, this is by far the most adorable cast seen on the big screen in a long time with the perfect chemistry that makes you want to jump on the set and see the pleasure of film making. The matter can be dismissed by the fact that this is a Hollywood consumer product, all that is of interest to Disney Studios and Lucas is to squeeze more money from viewers and especially fans. But when the feeling is that you are not watching another movie but at a real cinematic event like before, when watching provokes nostalgia and excitement, then as far as I am concerned, they will continue to create more films in the series, provided that their quality is at ""the Force Awakens"" level."
"We will make Star Wars fun again! This movie is so fun to sit through and the characters are fantastic, the jokes are great and the visuals epic. It has a good pace and the action is great, plus the return of Han Solo. My only complainant is it stuck to the New Hope storyline too much, but, then again, you could just think of it as a slight remake."
Horrible. Better watch ANH. Its obsolete to PT standards but still bette than this movie
"A boring, play-it-safe rehash of an already told story. Cliche character motivations, laced with fan service and chock full of mediocre dialogue and acting."
You could say it's just a remake of Episode 4 but to me it was so much more. Loved the story and the cast and it had a great setup for Episode 8.
The Force Awakens is a redeeming feature in the Franchise.
Never thought I would miss Jar Jar
"Squint and you can enjoy this movie as long as you don't think too much. Just listen to the music score. You can tell that this isn't really Star Wars by the music. Without Lucas to inspire, its by-the-numbers reboot and the biggest missed opportunity in cinema history. Luke, Han and Leia never get to be back onscreen together again. Instead we get awful new characters. It looks like Star Wars, doesn't sound musically like Star Wars and tastes horrid."
"beautiful film shooting of the Star Wars saga with a beautiful but unoriginal plot, but with a few holes, as for example, how does the protagonist know how to use the force so well if no one has ever trained her. Then the plot base is equal to the past trilogy"
"If you ignore the fact that this film is kind of a rehash of 'A New Hope', you will have an absolute blast with this film. Highly recommended. 9/10."
This is not how I remember Star Wars but it's good
I watched all the other Star Wars films so I could know what was happening in this. I'm glad I did.
"if you cant sleep, this movie will destroy your insomnia with such powerful boredom power! , the worst movie I ever saw in my entire life."
The film is a refreshing return to the original films while incorporating a great selection of new faces and new action.
It has great characters and is really fun to watch
Complete copy.  In pretty biased.  Still enjoy.it
Not as bad as Last Jedi but not that great either. I would of rather save my ticket money and pick up this at the DVD bargain bin.
It's not as good as the original movies but better than the prequels. I recommend it to all Star Wars fans
"With the difficult task of restarting the franchise, J.J. Abrams lands the perfect start of a new trilogy, with the right mix of fresh new characters and the old Star Wars legends we used to love."
Both a good continuation and a good a throwback to the originals that are combined professionally.
"Not too bad, was a nice reboot but nothing spectacular. Star Killer base was a bit of a joke though....they really couldn't dream up something else?"
"Sure this movie had some great action and cgi. But a major flaw with this movie was that it essentially was a copy of A New Hope. Which sounds like a good thing but it had many flaws. Just about everyone was super excited coming in to this movie. It had potential but surely didn't capitalize like Everyone thought it would. It wasn't a bad movie but certainly wasn't good. Rey seemed like a Mary Sue, Kylo Ren was a weak villain, and the logic behind a lot of these scenes doesn't make any sense. Hans scene at the end was a good scene that the movie capitalized on. I was a little weary when I saw Rey pilot the millennium Falcon so good but gave it a pass for whatever reason. I also thought the ancient Skywalker lightsaber would be locked up or something but I guess not. Admiral Hux though not a main character seemed like someone who inherited his power. The first order did seem like a powerful force throughout the movie (except for Kylo Ren). Han Solo was also a good character throughout the movie. I did like certain aspects but thought it was a copy of A New Hope. I also think Rey was a character that is somewhat relatable but very unlikable. She out of nowhere was good at everything. Luke was a good character because he actually faced controversy and had to bounce back from it. Rey on the other hand is good at everything for some reason. Her fight against Kylo Ren was when I lost it. It was a terrible fight and Rey shouldn't have won against a Sith Lord who spent years of training and was strong with the dark side. There is no way that Rey who touches a lightsaber for the first time in her life defeats a Sith Lord that same day. I know Kylo Ren is not the strongest villain in the world but he still should have beaten her easily in that duel. It was honestly ridiculous and the worst lightsaber duel I've seen. The reason I have this rated at 2.5 stars is because it created a lot of questions and buzz throughout the Star Wars community and still made fans excited for episode 8. It certainly isn't even close to the original Star Wars movies but still made fans leave the theatre with some excitement."
It was quite unoriginal and it could've gone in a better direction
Its a crowd pleasing movie that has a lot of the same stuff as other Star Wars movies.
Thank you disney for ruining star wars...
"This movie is AWESOME. J.J has directed a fun, action filled Star Wars film that feels like the original trilogy, but also feels very new, Ridley and Boyega lead the acting pack in the film and in turn give us some great performances and new characters to love in the franchise. Ford and Issac also deliver great performances, and Driver feels very whiny, but he does great with what he's given. The beginning and the middle are great, but the third act is very repetitive of A New Hope, but that said Lucas loves rhyming in the SW universe, it's like a poem, so I don't mind it that much because there is plenty of new stuff to detract from that. All in all TFA is a solid Star Wars film there rejouvenated the franchise and shows us that Disney can take care of our beloved universe."
"Not bad at the time it premiered, but than TLJ happened :( and now the first installment doesn't look too good as in cohesive."
"Although it has its flaws, TFA is a great place to start a new Star Wars trilogy. It's undoubtedly almost a carbon copy of A New Hope, and negates everything the heroes of the original trilogy did to save the galaxy; but despite all that, I still liked it.

The characters are for the most part interesting and likeable, particularly Finn (how will an ex-stormtrooper, indoctrinated into the First Order, deal with fighting against his former brothers and sisters?) and Rey (who is she, and why is she so powerful? Could she be a Skywalker, or is she some sort of new Chosen One?). Poe was also very likeable but lacked the backstory to become particularly interesting in this movie. Kylo Ren, although acted brilliantly by Adam Driver, unfortunately came across as little more than an emo teenager waving a lightsaber around, making him not all that interesting.

The OT characters were handled moderately well, with Leia in a position of leadership as she should be, and Luke, although he isn't present in the movie until the last scene, treated with the reverence you would assume of someone who should now be a Jedi Master after defeating the Emperor in ROTJ and after all the years inbetween that and TFA. On the other hand, Han Solo was unfortunately thrown under the bus, having forgotten everything he learned about family and fighting for a cause you believe in during the OT.

The setting could have been explained a lot better: why is the New Republic such a limp fish, and why are they disarming in the midst of a threat? How did the First Order become such a threat so quickly? Why has the NR forgotten everything they should have learned very well from the Rebels' fight against the Empire in the OT? But although it was a very flimsy setting overall, it did seem to work.

The story had far too many similarities with A New Hope, but moved along at a good pace and did a fantastic job of introducing the new characters. JJ set up a lot of interesting ideas and cliffhangers, such as what will happen to Finn, why has Luke been hiding on an island all this time, who exactly is Rey, and who is Snoke and how did he get to where he is today.

Overall this was a good movie and a good place to start the new trilogy. JJ's job was to get old fans interested in Star Wars again, and pull new fans in. He did that very, very well. It's incredibly sad that Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi ruined everything he set up, but TFA can still be watched and enjoyed even if you hated TLJ."
"The downfall has started, not for a faction in particular this time, but for the saga itself. The protagonists are either under-used or botched or straight-up don't make any sense (Rey, you're too good at everything). The new antagonists seem to be a copy-paste of the ancient ones, up to their resources which come from nowhere (don't expect the movie to answer your questions). The scenario is filled with plot holes and dumb strings to make the story go on. It is otherwise a beautiful film, but I hated the story. It's basically a rehash of a New Hope but with no setup and very poorly written."
Not a bad movie at all. There where a few plot thing's that bothered me. But overall well worth the watch.
"If you watched A New Hope you have seen a superior version o the Force Awakens.  The special effects are only slightly better.  It throws away the old canon and leaves only questions.  Fans of JJ Abrams endings such as Lost will like it.  But if you like coherent stories, endings that make sense and connections to the OT  It's more rotten than a taphonomy exibit

Star Wars Fans will ask ""how/why can she do that?"""
can we say rinse and repeat?
"Despite it being the same story of A New Hope, The Force Awakens brings back the charms and lightsaber visuals with old and new developed characters!"
really dicen que esto es una buena peli  esta pagina no tiene credibilidad ya
J. J Abrams showcases his genius yet again.
"A soft remake of the original introduces interesting characters. Although it breaks some of the franchise lore and invalidates it to a certain extent, its biggest mistakes are some of the unearned character elements and overall dependence of a nostalgia factor"
"A rip-off of A New Hope. But at least it is well made, not like its sequel. This movie is really disappointing, but when you understand, and accept, that it won't be nothing more than a rip-off of Episode 4, it will become at least entertaining"
"It's a little plain and too close to the original to be considered a creative work, choreography needs some work. But all around good movie."
"It looks and sounds amazing which is nothing new for a star wars movie but sadly its script isnt as good. Though its not as bad as The Last Jedi, it still has various plot holes. It's a movie that has a script that depreciates in value the more that you think about it however it can still be very entertaining. JJ Abrams has stated that he ""didnt want the film to feel like it wasn't inclusive."" The problem with this is that he may have focused on diversity a little too much and clearly didn't focus enough on his script. His writing may be fun but it's mediocre. There's nothing wrong with diversity, but when writing a story you should be more focused on making a good story than having a diverse cast because if you dont you may forget about world building and character development which are two things that JJ rushed through and sloppily at that. It's also no secret that the film rips off a New Hope."
This movie has killed the trilogy and the prequels as the movies are based of anakin turning into the man in the mask
"Abrams knows how to make a film. A fine addition to the Star Wars canon. Ridley is amazing and adds a fantastic new character to the SW universe. The idea of a Stormtrooper abandoning his role because of moral qualms seemed forced, but Boyega was so great in his role that I didn't care about the weird plot device. Driver is a little whiny as Kylo, but he is Luke's nephew after all. Overall a fabulous film worth watching again and again."
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a return to form for the saga, combined with Abrams's direction, the script he co-wrote with Kasdan and Arndt, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Mindel's cinematography, Brandon and Markey's editing, Carter and Gilford's production design, Sandales' set decoration, Kaplan's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, The Force Awakens is a worthy inclusion into the Skywalker saga!!!"
"This classic franchise resurfaces once more to deliver another story about a person on a farm learning to become a jedi and help a rebellion destroy and evil empire's greatest weapon. Despite the similarities to the original trilogy, TFA eases  in the new cast with a good story."
"It's a good movie, but a little bit too predictable. The acting, music and story are all great and it successfully rebooted the franchise. My only complaints are that it is too much like a New Hope and that the transition from old characters to new characters happens too fast in this trilogy."
"This movie truly put the shine back on the Star Wars franchise. Obviously formulaic, but sometimes the audience loves what it loves. Could have done without Han and Leia. I don't think the story really needed them, but I must admit that was more of a hindsight observation. Couldn't help but cheer for the good guys!"
A complete rehash of Episode IV.
"The Movie Is Literally (Star Wars - New Hope version 2015)
It Has No Individuality For Itself. That's The Biggest Problem"
"While a reboot of the first Star Wars may have been a safe bet, it doesn't make for compelling story telling. This movie has great potential, but doesn't execute well."
Though the plot is recycled from A New Hope I still had a lot of fun with The Force Awakens.
"This thing is just a carbon copy of another movie. I did, however, love how Chewbacca had a rep as a man whore."
Here is movie that started destruction of Star Wars
"Not good, poor writing, bad acting, just bad!

A lot of unexplained strange stuff, you'll be asking a lot of questions after the movie like how did she know how to fly that really old space ship when she has never flown one before......  a lot of stuff like that, the moving falls back on and depends on nostalgia."
second worst after episode 8
"Only slightly better than The last Jedi, which is the worst Star Wars so far. Anyone saying these two newest movies keep the SW spirit alive, has good characters and good character development is lying to your face. All these good reviews are either paid off or know nothing of Star Wars."
"It's a good start for this new trilogy. I should say that they didn't take risks with this one, but that is comprehensive. It was the first one. One mistake in this one could ruin everything. Kylo Ren is the best character, he steals the show."
Really good start to a new trilogy. Would be 5 stars if not for the using the same plot as a new hope.
If I wanted to watch A New Hope I would have done so at home and not spent money on this film. Unbelievable how many people were sucked in by this film which adds nothing to the world and completely nullifies the events of the originals while following their formula. A real kick in the teeth for true Star Wars fans
I'd give it a 1/2 star but then my score wouldn't count.
Very disappointing.
Just a retread of a New Hope. Should just go watch that instead
"Great Star Wars movie.  Action packed, good story and nostalgic. Han and Chewie!"
Very good movie with awesome graphics.
"Even though there was a lot I didn't like about this movie I still walked away feeling a generally positive response. I can't say I hated it like with the following movies, and I have actually rewatched it a couple of times since it released. Guess JJ shouldn't have given up the reins."
"When I first saw The Force Awakens, I absolutely loved it. Now, I would just say it's a good movie. It is an entertaining, funny and exciting installment in the Star Wars universe, and it set up some great stuff, even though The Last Jedi didn't follow through with expanding on those ideas. Nonetheless, I still really like Force Awakens."
"So much fun. So enjoyable. I've seen it countless times and still feel entertained. Plot wasn't super original, but movie made up for it in every other area."
A nostalgic thrill ride!
"Fast paced, exhilarating, and fun, the force awakens kickstarted Star Wars again with unrelenting energy and vigor."
"Star Wars is a masterpiece of classic cinema and with this new sequence we realize that it has brought the essence of what was and is still the three classic Star Wars. A well-produced screenplay, very good performances with Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver merit and a sensational climax and complication, plus its great special effects, editing and soundtrack."
"Okay... a small robot with a fun personality is carrying secret information and gets lost on a planet that is seemingly entirely desert.  It is found by a young adult orphan that has an unusual affinity for the force but is unaware of this.  The young adult escapes the Empire's troops by flying away on the Millennium Falcon.  There is a bar scene with a bunch of aliens.  A father figure is murdered in front of the young adult.  The Empire has a giant planet destroying weapon.... now tell me, am I talking about A New Hope or The Force Awakens?  While visually stunning, this movie was flat out, too similar to the original.  I'm all in favor of paying homage, but c'mon man?!  Try to be at least a little original.  Other than the obvious copy of the original movie, this was still an adequate Star Wars film and will fall somewhere in the upper middle of the ranking of them all.  The only other real issue I had was the 'Mary Sue' treatment that Rey got.  She was already better with the force, with no training, the Kylo who had been trained his whole life.  There was no consistency with Kylo - he's stopping blaster fire with the force in one scene and struggles to defeat an ex-janitor with no force powers in a later scene during a light saber dual.  Very meh  -  hopefully they will provide some logical reasoning to back up the plot holes in this one in the future installments."
"A great movie. The only flaw is Rey. She is a mary sue that has only 9,000 midi-chlorians (average for a jedi), so she is not even that powerful. She also has no story arc."
es en serio?  esta basura 92%  como que esta pagina no es nada seria  por que tambien vi que  a  django  le dieron buena puntuacion   lamentable  esta pagina
This movie got me excited about Star Wars again. I hope J.J. can fix the mess ruin johnson left for him for 9.
"This movie was made primarily from two ingredients:
1) A retread of A New Hope, setting up the same conflict, using the same tropes and character outlines from the original trilogy, with none of the heart, originality, or logical consistency of A New Hope.

2) Soulless exploitation of previously established characters.Beloved characters from previous films are brought back to draw in the fans, paraded around, and thrown about and destroyed for mere shock value.

The Force Awakens is a giant middle finger to the original trilogy, especially in the faux-Luke in the form of Rey, perhaps the biggest Mary Sue of all time."
"Though action-packed and filled with eye-popping wonders, the movie was a tad bit unoriginal."
"Why do Disney not want anyone good to live, why is plank so unrelatable and somehow a genius? Because Disney woke"
"I'm a huge Star Wars fan - old school original trilogy - and I actually loved this movie, got totally sucked in, even teared up a little at the end. The opening sequence is wonderful - dark, suspenseful, exciting - gets things off to a great start (contrast this with Last Jedi, which opens with a immature phone prank and totally illogical and unbelievable action sequence). I loved Fin's struggle and journey, totally awesome and original story about a storm trooper, this is the first time in the Star Wars saga that the audience gets to see from the perspective of a storm trooper and I loved it. Loved his bromance with Poe, loved his crush on Ray. Loved Ray learning about the force from Han, loved Han generally. Just a great movie. Biggest flaw in my opinion was how the ending kind of recycles old plot points of attacking a planet killing base. Otherwise, two thumbs up. Happy to have JJ back for episode 9. And if you're reading this Rian, seriously f off and die."
"Take pages from IV-VI's script, paste them together, then throw in far too many explosions, and you're done!  At least, JJ was done.  If this is 'visionary', we need some blindness."
"This is a terrible mess. Unbelievable how this got botched this badly, given the epic source material."
The movie is quite horrible. They completely destroyed the concept of the force and how it works. It has to be that the makers didn't know anything about Star Wars.
A new different environment with new cast for a Star Wars film works!
"Hollow clone banking on nostalgia and cardboard characters, almost feels like fan fiction."
"I know a lot of people have complained about The Force Awakens, but I don't care. This film did everything I wanted it to do.

Is there another Death Star-like base? Yeah, but I don't mind it. After the (first two) prequels, I believe it was the right choice to give us something familiar before going off to do something very different. Even when that happens, people STILL like to complain.

The Force Awakens is full of fantastic effects, rich character personalities and development, and a great introduction to a great new future."
Star Wars: Episode VII - A New Hope 2.0. “‘nuff” said.
"Don't let the rabid ""fans"" convince you otherwise. The Force Awakens is beautiful, has awesome action, and an intriguing story."
Provides an action-packed beginning to a promising new trilogy and reminds fans of the originals. It cleverly combines the new and the old which helps to provide a mystical and exciting start.
A nice coalition of other Star Wars films. One of the best overall film with a nice twist on the original Trilogy. Easiest film to re-watch and easy entrance point into the Star Wars saga.
Please bring George Lucas back.
"Rey is too powerful already and should not have defeated kylo so easily or piloted the falcon so adeptly. Also, leaving the mask on kylo the crybaby would have been way better to leave it on as the beginning he was actually a scary villain."
"One of the most anticipated movies of all time, Episode VII delivered a fun yet familiar tale of adventure and discovery, while adding in some new wrinkles in along the way. TFA is a safe reboot of the Star Wars franchise that revived the excitement many had felt for previous installments."
"so bad, re -write please"
"This movie was actually not that bad and set up a very exciting trilogy moving forward. However, knowing what we know now about the trilogy, it is sad to see how much wasted potential this movie was"
"I enjoyed this movie. 
The good: It was refreshing and entertaining.

The bad: A complete copy of A New Hope"
"Aqui Star Wars faleceu, o fim da franquia personagens rasos trama lixo, um vilÃ£o decepcionante, e uma protagonista medÃ­ocre e forÃ§ada, parece q foi proposital! Decepcionante Disney matou a franquia!"
"RIP iconic Han Solo, you shall be forever remembered. We were all with him through all his other adventures, and seeing him be murdered by his own son was violent, brutal, and not to mention incredibly sad and disappointing. We can only guess the fate of Leia. KEEP HER ALIVE, DISNEY! All around okay, and at points very disappointing (I'm looking at you, Kylo Trash Can Ren)"
"An overrated blockbuster that's so unoriginal, they might have well just played ""A New Hope"" (which this movie aggressively borrows from) in my theatre. With the exception of a few interesting characters, this movie doesn't hold a candle to the epic saga that the original trilogy was."
"A terrible lack of imagination and originality. Easily 
 the worst Star Wars movie with ""The Last Jedi"". 
I don't think those who wrote the script ever get aware from the Star Wars Universe. It's a Â«Â money-movieÂ Â». 
I really don't understand those high rates, this is just a shame. Like many fans, we feel a deep sadness about this new trilogy."
"In the 80s The Transformers cartoon movie killed off Optimus Prime, the reaction was complete crushing of the audience and young children who the movie was for was defeated to the point that children were not as interested in the transformers cartoon/ toys. This change had effect on the GI Joe cartoon that when went straight to video as well as did not kill off duke. Now we have The Last Jedi that killed off Luke like a b*tch. Same issue, while the audience is older the movie is a partial callback to the originals. They decided to kill Luke and not in the way the audience can accept. The director did not understand what he was creating. If Luke trained Rey, then died in the third movie like a boss the movie would have been a lot better received."
Terrible soft reboot! Disney sucks at Star wars!
"Not a great movie, but at least it setup some ground work for future films.  If only the creators hadn't decided to do a complete 180 on the plot in episode 8.  It's as if episode 8 makes episode 7 even worse.  The story arc is such a mess now."
Very nostalgic! JJ Abrams did a good job!
"My favorite SW movie, so much fun and emotion!"
Horrible just horrible. Pretty much a remake of the original with zero originality. Extremely poorly written and complete waste of time. I've bought every lucas star wars mutlitple times. Will never buy a Disney star wars as they are horrible SJW messes
"Better than the prequels, but not that great..."
"Since Disney has taken over this franchise, the stories have gone to crap. They are all about fighting and action scenes, no true story and drama. No back stories, no wider than just the main character stories. They have gone down hill, and are also politically correct. Extremely disappointed in the franchise."
quite Ok. this movie was a pretty good setup for the movies to come but episode 8 destroyed everything making this movie like a pilot of a TV series that never aired...
The Disney Star Wars make me miss Darth Jar Jar...
This mediocre mess deserves less than this. It is almost insulting how the treated original characters and how identical the plot is from the original movie. Don't even bother.
Why are there good reviews on this? Then last Jedi is good? Makes no sense
"Visually, i thought this movie was beautiful.  Also, i thought that the acting was much better than in the prequels but not  iconic as the originals, so just meh.  The big problem with me is the story. if the story is not good than what is the point.  At the end of return of the jedi, the emperor was killed, death star destroyed, and the empire fell shortly after.  One would assume that the the republic would return to power and relative peace would be achieved for another millennia.  Nope.  They say that a small contingent of empire loyalists hid out in the outskirts of the galaxy, rebuilt, and came back in thirty years with the power to contest the entire galactic republic as space nazis.  Where the hell did they get the resources to build another fleet and also another planet killing weapon?  The galactic republic has tax revenues from every planet in the republic, so are well funded.  Where do the space nazis get their money?  Where the hell did Snope come from (never explained)?  Just a lot of bullshiet story telling that makes no sense, and then throw in a sprinkle of sjw social engineering and you have a hot mess."
"This movie was horrible. The plot is derived to the point where unoriginallity defeats the retro feel. The storyline has huge plot holes and the characters are unendearing. Kylo Ren is incapable of defeating a storm trooper with a light saber, The First Order's generals are cringeworthy, and the death of a major character is predictable from miles away."
Love the new characters and all very entertaining.
I had to see this movie twice to give it a decision.  Character development is not believable and story line felt like the director never saw the original movies or read any of the books.  Was very surprised that this movie scored so high on the Tomatometer.  I'm starting to doubt the validity of Rotten tomatoes.
literally a copy of a new hope I feel cheated waiting this long for a new star wars movie to just end up with a reboot
"No Stars, I cant say anything but that this film was honestly trash. Honestly Trash"
Only a bad remake from new hope
"I'm going to start by saying that I am a fan of all things Star Wars, and I have been for well over 15 years.  However, my aim is to still remain fully unbiased in my review.

So, the order may be a little confusing, with Lucasfilm having released episodes IV, V and VI in the '80s followed by I, II and III in the '00s and now episodes VII, VIII and IX.  There is a reason behind the chaos, but I won't get into that now.  What you need to know is that this is a fresh start (although nostalgia reigns supreme here).

The film itself tells the continued story of several cast members from the original trilogy (IV, V & VI) â"" Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) â"" as well as adding a wonderful new cast with Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn) and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).  This list could extend far beyond these but for the sake of space this will do.

I won't be giving any spoilers in this review, even though the film has been out for a while.  If you've managed to avoid hearing anything yet, then you deserve to be rewarded for that.
If I were to pick the biggest weakness for the film, I would have to put it on Adam Driver (Kylo Ren).  However I don't think it's fair that I do so.  Even being a Star Wars fan, I have to keep in mind that this is an ongoing and evolving story so characters will change throughout.

Almost from the first second, you will feel at home if you've ever seen anything Star Wars.  Not only did J.J. Abrams pack the film to the brim with nostalgia (which I think he could have cut back a little on), but he made the cast and environment feel like we never left this world.

For a film that is over two hours in length, the time flys by while watching.  The story is paced very well and although it covers a lot of ground, it does so in a way that keeps you hooked throughout.  I'm very excited to see where the franchise goes from here.  I hope they're able to slowly weed out the original cast and bring the new cast to the front.  I love the connection as much as anyone else, but I want to see what all the newcomers bring to the story.

In conclusion, I think what makes this a great film is the fact that it can stand on its own.  Obviously it would help if you've seen the previous installments, but you can still jump right in and know exactly what's going on.  There may be a few characters that you don't understand the importance of, but Lucasfilm does a great job of welcoming everyone to this franchise.  Episode VIII will be released in 2017 and IX in 2019."
"Two words: loved it.
The feelings I got as a kid? Rekindled. The new characters? Awesome! The old characters? Oh yeah!
I didn't like the rathtar stuff, but that's all I got for negative stuff. The rest blew me away.

Especially Rey really warmed my heart. Thought she was cool on screen, but when my little ones practically gushed about her, well - that sealed the deal. A new hero has risen, for my kids and I both."
Too much nostalgia to stand on its own. Direction is great but too many deja vus.
This was a bad film. Just a bunch of fancy set pieces with zero substance.
"The force is female - thats all you need to know. Cannon is gone, story is gone, fans have gone."
"Everything George Lucas should have done when he decided to do episodes I to III. J.J. Abrams manages to make a movie full of adventures, action, humor and still manages to pay homage to the initial triology, although the argument is very close to episode IV the feeling of nostalgia is immediate and we feel grabbed from beginning to end. Excellent entertainment."
"Force Awakens felt like both an homage to the original Star Wars and and an exciting beginning to a new trilogy. It has some really fun scenes that can quickly go towards serious and tragic and then back again without missing a beat, giving the whole movie a great roller coaster sort of feel.

All of the characters are great, and I knew from the moment that Luke's lightsaber flew to Rey that I was hooked for life... Is what I would like to say.

The movie is great, and a good jumping on point, but unfortunately, unless Episode IX addresses some issues, many of the threads laid down here are severed or never picked up in the Last Jedi. The movie, alone though, is still fun and worth watching and a very solid 4 stars in my opinion. Rey and Finn have the heart and charm to carry a trilogy. I'm hoping IX gives them that chance."
"Although filled with plenty of thrills and fancy visual effects, Daisy Ridley fails to shine through."
"Although some scenes might be long, this film is great for the New Trilogy."
This was a terrible star wars roboot
Never should have been made. TERRIBLE
Asks more questions than it answers.  A new crew for the Falcon and some new baddies but really just a rebrand of the same things we grew to love.  Let's see where this goes...
I expected much more from Disney than this copy.
"A jam packed engaging film, fun for the whole family. It brings back memories and characters that we know and love. However, though amazing lost a great deal of it's comedic wit compared to the original trilogy and prequels."
"As a movie I would give this 4 and a half stars. As a Star Wars movie I would give 3, this movie was very similar to Star Wars a new hope, I wish they made this movie more unique."
incredible and perfect movie
"As a movie I would give this 4 and a half stars. As a Star Wars movie I would give 3, this movie was very similar to Star Wars a new hope, I wish they made this movie more unique."
"Episode VII may not be the best-made film of the saga, but it is my go-to Star Wars movie nonetheless. JJ manages to introduce a lovable set of new characters in the midst of the iconic existing cast and lore. It's well-balanced and paced with just the right amounts of story, action and humor."
"Really not what I was expecting.  Some of the story elements just didnt feel right.  BUT the acting was solid, and the movie was fun.  Need to improve the writing..."
"Bad writing, i found myself wondering why did black happen, when it would make more sense if... etc. Watching Last Jedi makes this worse as you hoped more things will be explained there which were not..."
Incredible. Absolute incredible. I love the storytelling. I love the new characters. This movie is filled with tons of emotion. J.J. Abrams made a masterpiece. Grade: A+
"at first view i was like...WTF, after the third view i decided i have to find a new hobby, maybe sleeping...jar jar abrams..."
"Even though people called it Star Wars 2.0... still loved it.  My son really got into it.  Careful with the next episode, though.  Things go downhill very quickly."
"Although The Force Awakens does copy some plot points from A New Hope, Ep. VII still brings a good Star Wars experience"
Â¿Quï¿ 1/2 (C) le pasÃ³ a la franquicia? Tiran todo lo clÃ¡sico para alejar a los fans antiguos. En lugar de juntar los nuevos personajes con los de antaÃ±o desperdician a los nuevos no haciendo un pase de estafeta coherente.
"Great movie, amazing build up for a new Starwars univese. Too bad they destroyed everything in the next."
Liked the originality of its roots to the series and the cast.  Scenes are rich with color and life.  I enjoyed it.
"Pretty good movie, though they shied away from doing anything with Luke Skywalker."
"I like The Force Awakens and some of the mysteries it set up (which was later squandered). However, the third act is a bit too much of a repeat of the original film."
The force awakens does have it's moments especially when the older series characters are on screen but the story line is that of episode 4 and the new characters have the personalities of one note stereotypes.
"Buona sceneggiatura. Il film è recitato veramente bene e girato molto bene con scenografie pazzesche. A mio parere uno dei migliori film di fantascienza della storia! Colonna sonora ottima! Voto: 8,5"
"Decent movie with a mostly captivating narrative, passable characters, good immersion, and satisfactory themes. However, I disliked its sheer lack of originality. When I went to the theater I was expecting an new movie, not a remake of ""A New Hope."""
"Excellent...just excellent, truly captures the joy of star wars and the threats within this galaxy. Alot of people criticise the plot similarities to a new hope but that is clear only reused to allow us to engage with the characters more. This is an easy recommendation to anyone to watch."
"One could argue that Star Wars had to return at it's most iconic, and for this reason, new ideas, new villains, new threats and a new plot....just weren't feasible. However, I am of the opinion that they missed a trick. I think the story leading up to The Force Awakens is more interesting.....than the Force Awakens. It feels like everything has been reset, and nothing has really happened since the last chronological entry (Return of the Jedi). We have skipped a huge development in the story, and are back to square one. Instead of introducing new villains, new ideas and new settings, we have a new Empire, a new Rebellion, a new Darth Vader, a new Luke, a new Deathstar, new Storm Troopers. We don't even get new settings. We have another dessert planet that looks like Tatooine, we have a new Ice Planet that looks like Hoth, and a new Jungle planet that looks like Endor. The film doesn't have the rewatch value of other Star Wars movies, nor the romance or complexity. This one is designed to be an easily digestible reintroduction to the Star Wars universe with nothing new to add in terms of story or character. For that reason, it's one of my least favourite star wars movies and I would be incredibly bored watching it again."
Decent intro for a good story sadly not passed trough to the next one.
"The Force Awakens reignited my love for this saga. It felt like a safely played new age rip of 1977's ""A New Hope,"" but it managed to deliver. Rey quickly became a favorite of mine."
Good movie on its own. Great way to restart the saga. Didn't like a couple of things that happened to our favorite characters. Last Jedi also ruined everything that this film set up.
"Disney don't give a fuck about those movies, there wasn't any scenario, just some old characters for the nostalgy and a big promotional for sell toys. And i don't care about those movies, they are insignificant....what make me sad is that people thought thoses are good star wars and good films (ploat twist, there are not )

But if everyone think like this and cheer shitty, we ain't gonna have a lot of good scenario in futur...."
Good Return Of The Trilogy
"Great acting. The relationships of the characters are strong. Though the story is predictable and rehashed from Star Wars (1977). Some characters Are bland. This movie has a great pace, characters and story. There is a mix of comedy, action and emotion in this film. It's a great film to start off a new trilogy."
Pretty good. I liked the cinematography but they are selling us all a new hope again. Felt like Finn was overacting. Lots of running and screaming. Hopefully they give him more to do in future movies.
Worst villain in any movie I've ever seen.  The POS ruined the movie & made us miss good ol' Darth Vader even more.  We absolutely hated the 3 main actors who completely ruined the movie for us.  Rogue One was totally awesome... This one sucked!!!
"While this is a complete retread of a New Hope with all fancy CGI, it can work as a foundation if properly expanded on in the subsequent films."
"Alussa olin liian negatiivinen uutta TÃ¤htien sota elokuvaa kohtaa, mutta kun ensimmÃ¤inen traileri tuli, odotukset olivat suuret. Lopulta jÃ¤i hieman tavoitteesta mutta pidÃ¤n tÃ¤stÃ¤."
"I didn't think the acting was very good or maybe it was just the characters that were boring. Either way, it made for a not so great movie which is too bad because Star Wars has always been fun to watch."
"El despertar de la fuerza individualmente es una buena pelÃ­cula con grandes actuaciones y efectos especiales. Su Ãºnico problema es que no es original y pega mucho a la nostalgia a pesar que la historia en si quiera crear su propio legado.

Esta pelÃ­cula parece un ""Ok, George Lucas la jodio con las precuelas, les daremos algo que les complazcan a ustedes y a los nuevos fans"" y en realidad esto suena genial! y por momentos parece ser asÃ­, hasta que...  oh vaya 'A New Hope' remasterizada. 
Adam Driver arroya como Kylo Ren. Personajes como Rey y Finn saben llenar la pantalla. 
El elenco original de la saga como Han solo (Harrison Ford), Leia (Carrie Fisher) y muchos cameos como C3PO entre otros se llegan a agradece por que esto nos hace sentir dentro del universo Star Wars... lo unico malo es que este recurso se siente forzado en algunas ocasiones por como la historia se desarrolla y hace que estas apariciones tengan lugar. Para rematar y tengo que redundar en esto, la historia es del Episodio IV, eso hace que la pelicula no pueda progresar por si misma para poder asi crear su propio legado ya que no te deja nada entraÃ±able.

Ok, pero estoy hablando como fan... quizas las nuevas audiencias (quienes hicieron que este filme fuera de las mas taquilleras de la historia) no sepan nada de 'A New Hope' y al ver esto ya se quedaron maravillados con como el universo galactico de esta saga te puede llegar a sorprenden con dramas familiares, guerras intergalacticas por la libertad y opresion, personajes enigmaticos y otros comicos...

El filme de por si es bueno, pero su guion no es para nada original."
"Pretty bad. Finn is the worst character introduced in this film. Basically imagine Han Solo with everything great about him removed and take the worst aspects child Anakin Solo and roll them into one character. 

Rey is a Mary Sue there is no denying that. She is good at everyhing with zero explanation at all. It is even more ridiculous in episode 8. Hopefully 9 offers an explanation.

Kylo Ren is the emo kid no one ever liked  but this time he has a lightsaber.

Poe Dameron is the most interesting new character by far but gets very little screen time."
Im so so disappointed in the franchise anf im officially done with star wars. Thank you Disney for destroying my favorite story. After Solo and this ill never watch another star wars movie again. Rogue One was awesome tho.
This movie keeps the star wars franchise Strong.
"Lackluster new characters, old characters are poorly written. Character development is nonexistent. Are we to believe that Han Solo had no character development in 30 years. At least the Star Wars EU utilized the characters in a logical way. This movie is derivative and unintelligent."
"very weak, boring movie,"
"It was painful and hard to watch such a beloved series come to a mediocre and sloppy last arc. This tried too hard to follow the aftermath of a story that had its epic conclusion by its chronological predecessor. Anybody who loves the franchise simply cannot overlook the fact that this is in fact the ""safest"" version of episode 4 packed into a brand new can full of FX that fails to distract your attention from the shallowness of its terrible writing."
Mary Sue beats the trilogy villain and and ruins the entire story lore in one scene. Horrible design
A new new hope.  I didn't like this film and TLJ has made it so I will wait till some streaming service or plane ride to view ep 9.  To bad though I did enjoy Rogue One.  All the rest of these new star wars films have no good stories to tell.
Really bad characters.
"The rebirth of the Star Wars Saga is welcomed back with plenty of nostalgia and beautiful moments. While some of the plot points seem derivative, the overall story is a creative step in the right direction. The new characters are all very charismatic and interesting, bringing mystery to the franchise again. However, I could have gone without another Death Star/Planet."
"Star Wars: The Force Awakens may rely heavily on the nostalgia factor, but is a well-made movie with good humor, good acting and a story that could've gone anywhere. Had it not been for The Last Jedi, this movie might've been a really good Star Wars movie."
"Has alot of nice moments and get me nostalgic but to much copying of ""A new hope"" and leaves some other minor bad tastes lingering. 
Rogue One is the best of the ""new"" movies so far."
"This movie had its problems but was still entertaining. I thought that the story was going in a direction, that is until The Last Jedi. TLJ ruined the trilogy, The Force Awakens, and everything that came before it. It's sad. My rating is for The Force Awakens before The Last Jedi."
This was such a disappointment. Waited years for new Star Wars and this rehashed story was such a let down. Star Wars is DEAD!
A New Hope did the same plot better.
not bad movie I have seen it before a new hope
a movie skating on thin ice as a copy and paste job that actually becomes even worse after viewing the last jedi
Rehash of A New Hope
Ive seen dog turds with better consistency than this SJW Femist trash movie.  Jar Jar Abrams RAPING ANOTHER FRANCHISE.
I didn't enjoy this movie when it came out. It was just a retelling of Star Wars 4 and was trying to push nostalgia instead of a good movie
Low quality rehash of Episode IV
"Pessimo film, Ã¨ una perdita di tempo."
This movie is just awful.  I felt like I was looking inside the ark of the covenant.  Let's all just wait until a competent company acquires the rights from Disney and remakes them.
"Ridiculously boring, kylo is the worst character ever written, and did i mention it was boring"
A pathetic copy of the New Hope storyline
"YES. While ""The Force Awakens"" is not completely original in plot structure, it STILL feels like a Star Wars film from start to finish. Writer/Director J.J. Abrams solidifies the saga's past sensation and legacy while enhancing it with new energy for a new generation. Immediately after the film ended, I wanted to see MORE. It made me want to scream ""ENCORE!"". DO NOT JUDGE ME, but this is my second favorite Star Wars film of all time... and I am not afraid to admit it. The Force Awakens was the most fun I had in a theater in the year of 2015, and it reminded me why I love and cherish film, even amongst its obvious flaws."
"Con personajes interesantes, es totalmente genial."
"La pero pelicula de Star Wars dioses porque hicierop algo asi, deberian estar enjaulados. menos Mark Hamill."
"No Luke? Over-powered character, tantrum throwing bad guy....lots of holes that need explaining....help me Obi-wan Kenobi, youâ(TM)re my only hope..."
The movie was ok. I didnt like how they propped up the movie with carrie fisher and harrison ford but their parts were so minimal.
"Just a re-skin of A New Hope. Uninteresting characters, mediocre acting. Slightly disappointed."
"""Maaaaa Reeeeey suuuuuuuuuuueeeeeee"" -E;R"
This movie is only good because it's a rehashing of episode IV.
Chewy walked right by leia after Han died I walked out of the theater
"Very disappointed in this one.  Instead of giving us a continuation of the original trilogy, someone thought it was a good idea to decide that the Empire hadn't been defeated and that somehow, magically, the Rebellion failed.  Also, Mary Sues are a good idea in your franchise because... wahmen!!  And let's not forget, Han Solo must've been a dead beat dad because he's an evil white man!  Gotta' kill that Corellian S.O.B. off!"
"4 star until the Last Jedi came out. Now retrospective dropped to 2.5 due to SJW nonsense. Brought merch for TFA, none for TLJ, and I actually want to stop using my TFA merch now."
kinda liked it. loved when Han and chewie got intop the falcon again
"There was a time when I would have given this a much higher rating.  The movie itself was not outstanding, but was a promise of a trilogy that would take us back to basics.  JJ Abrams perfectly set up intrigue - just like his ""mystery box"" story telling style usually does.  However, Rain Johnson completely sucked the wind out of this trilogy (and franchise) with The Last Jedi.  What an absolute shame."
The long waited seventh part of the Star Wars Saga kicks off a great new trilogy.
"Me entretuve viendo la pelÃ­cula, a pesar que la historia es un reciclado del episodio IV"
A retelling of the original star wars universe in a cyclical fashion. The apprentice is now a young woman withou a past who must fight to save the future. Fantastic!
"Suffers badly from The Last Jedi destroying everything it set up with no pay off. Not especially original, compelling, nor gripping but could've worked ok as a set up vehicle for the new timeline and setting a baseline for the new trilogy. Obviously no one could've predicted episode 8 would be such a disaster (especially Lucasfilm executives as they had no plan whatsover for the trilogy), and TFA is effectively dragged down by the corpse of TLJ."
Other than this feeling a bit like a rehash I gotta say it was a fun ride. Great Star Wars flick. JJ created some very interesting new characters here and sadly Rian crapped all over them. I give this 4 stars while TLJ got 1/4 a star. Please bring this interesting and relatable Rey back JJ. Save the trilogy.
They just copied Star Wars New Hope story and added worse characters. How can you manage a franchise like Star Wars and forget to contract writers.
recalentado del episodio iv
"I have not been so excited for a film in all my life. The hype and build up from the first teaser trailer in 2014 was immense. Cut to just over a year later, I am in the midnight screening and the wait was over. The film, in short, was incredible! The reactions from the crowd matched: laughs, tears and cheers! Nothing I had ever experienced since the original SW movies. 
JJs concept worked! With echos and nods to the originals whilst building a new set of characters for a new generation (as well as mine) to enjoy. It made everyone fall in love with Star Wars again. This movie is what it is suppose to be - a fun and exciting ride, filled with nostalgia."
"Not my favorite Star Wars movie, but a great come back to the long break of Star Wars movies. I really wished the classic characters had more prominence in the movie but it work out for the most part. Kylo Ren keep your mask on, you're much cooler that way!"
"I left the theaters genuinely happy with TFA. But after watching it a number of times after Iï¿ 1/2(TM)ve finally come to a conclusion filled with disappointment. My biggest issue with the film is the blatant rip-off of a New Hope and itï¿ 1/2(TM)s complete lack of world building. JJ and crew simply wrote three small paragraphs for the opening crawl and restarted the entire SW universe back to episode 4 with everything our beloved characters did becoming meaningless. This is aside from the fact that the new world doesnï¿ 1/2(TM)t make much sense either having a government with a resistance military branch?  The character building was not great but passable, but this episode had the main character already defeat the bad guy. Not much story telling for someone like Rey to grow and become more powerful, because sheï¿ 1/2(TM)s already powerful despite no training or help or failure and learning from such failures. So I have to give it this rating."
"It was ok, but Han dying really stung"
Mary Sue kicks but and is a complete redo of the old films
"So many missed opportunities, could of had the trio on screen one for one last send off . I watched this movie once   with no desire to see it again."
Not really a Star Wars movie.  They did not stay true to the rules of Star Wars when it comes to the force. Rey sucks.
A fun movie. Not the best of the franchise. Some good new characters. It will be interesting to see where they go from here.
Garbage. Completely unnecessary and pointless.
"This movie is Jar Jar Abrams trash. Got burned on Lost, Got burned by this."
I generally liked this movie when it came out. It wasn't perfect but I felt the story was being taken somewhere. Then The Last Jedi came out and completely ignored this movie and everything that came before it. The Last Jedi has made The Force Awakens a lesser movie that I won't even watch anymore. My rating is for the movie pre-TLJ.
A disgusting rip-off thinly disguised as original content. It physically hurt to see old series characters used in this way.
"Such a disappoint.  Disney reset the whole universe, killed a long time hero and told the same story we heard.  Wanted the heroes (Han, Luke and Leia) from the expanded universe.  There the story had actually progressed and those characters grew rather than turn into losers."
"this is a terrible movie. JJ Abrams just copied the original Star Wars that came out in 1977. But this time instead of a hero who needs to learn by their failures, he has created a heroine who knows everything and does not have to struggle or have failures. Rey can do everything her enemy can kylo and it's embarrassing. I would recommend not watching any of these sequel trilogies. you're better off watching the original trilogy and if you feel you need to watch the prequel trilogy too."
"This is a worthy-yet-flawed reintroduction to a galaxy far, far away. The film is a love letter to the Original Trilogy and hits on most cylinders. It serves with an organic mixing of new and beloved old characters while introducing a new threat to the saga."
"Rey's story is forgettable, the overall plot is unoriginal, coming out of light speed inside the atmosphere of a planet is absolutely ridiculous and therefore ascribed to lazy storytelling, and although they have workable characters, they're completely wasted with back stories that are neither believable nor compelling."
Essentially a remake of the original Star Wars. The original characters were wasted and the new characters were lifeless and one dimensional.
