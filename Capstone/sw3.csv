10x better then the ST
"The fight choreography in this movie is beautiful. Some of the dialogue can be awkward and confusing, but the way that is shows the light and dark is fantastic. This movie is now a favorite of mine."
"Ótimo filme, principalmente na questão do Anakin se voltando para o lado negro da força"
It is maybe hte best star wars movie it has so great fight scenes and looked great i loved ewan mc gregor as obi wan so much
"The best of a disappointing bunch, the third film from the prequel trilogy has some very memorable moments. The transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader is effective (but perhaps would have been more effective with a different actor)."
No doubt the best Star Wars Movie !
"A great film and an incredible ending to the George Lucas series of films.  Many people clump all three prequels together and label hem as bad. They are wrong, while The Phantom Menace may be so bad as to be unwatchable, Episode II is really, really good — if you could just green screen Natalie Portman out of it. This film, Revenge of the Sith is a masterpiece.  Incredible characters, like General Grievous; great action pieces, and a complex coming together of plot points in a very compelling story of political unraveling — George Lucas' story of deception Is really one of his finest pieces of writing. Time will tell, if this film never earned the praise it deserved, my guess is families will be watching this movie with their children long after the Disney Star Wars films have been forgotten."
"Es una buena película, con mucho CGI, pero con partes lentas y que solo sirven para explicar, sin embargo nos regala uno de los mejores momentos de la saga con un acompañamiento de John Williams deslumbrante"
A classic tragedy where the anti-hero fulfills his worst fears while trying desperately to avoid them.  Lucas makes his mark with this one.  It makes you wonder why he was so reviled that he was completely removed from the creative process for the final trilogy.
"i love it, B E C A U S E O F O B I W A N!"
"Excellent soundtrack, paired with exciting lightsaber fights and emotional moments make this an extremely enjoyable experience."
this is in my opinion the most emotionally impact-full of the star wars movies it have by far the best action and overall ties the prequels to the originals nicely.
"Senza dubbio il migliore della trilogia dei prequel, garantisce un buon impatto visivo e grande coinvolgimento emotivo in un finale ricco di pathos. La caratterizzazione dei vari personaggi risulta ben riuscita, sia per i protagonisti che per i personaggi secondari, con una sceneggiatura che punta tutti gli sforzi nella giusta direzione. Nel complesso è un degno finale ad una trilogia altalenante che conferma ancora una volta le sue enormi e, parzialmente sprecate, potenzialità."
Amazing best of starwars
This movie is truly epic.
"Best film of star wars, it connects the precuels with the originals and we can see the fall and born of the most iconic villian of all times"
Easily the best of the prequels and the lightsaber fights incredible
amazing love the new characters and how it connects into the original trilogy
FOR THE REPUBLIC!!!!
I laughed. I cried. I was moved beyond words. 11 out of 10
"This is where the fun begins.
Because of Obi-Wan."
"Perfect blend of action, humour, romance, sadness, happiness."
"10/10 amazing movie, quotable dialogue, great fight choreography, pinnacle of memes."
Great movie! A fine addition to any film collection.
The movie is really good and the purest Star Wars  film
"Some of the best Star Wars ever, John Williams set the score on fire, the action was entertaining, and I'm gonna be honest, I cry every time."
Best meme quality in the galaxy.
The best Star Wars movie. I have nothing to answer for.
"The best movie in the Star Wars saga. Words will not bring it justice, only watching it will."
"There's too many of them Master Skywalker, what are we going to do?"
"Even though many people think of it as a meme. It is actually a tragedy of a man who has to choose between a corrupted order or the dark side. It may not be the best Star Wars movie, it is a great film."
One of my favorite films in the franchise.
Shoulda won over batman...
It's not easy executing a movie when everybody already knows the end: Revenge of the Sith did it perfectly!
"After watching the Clone Wars series, this movie has a whole new depth. Taken together, it is an epic accomplishment."
"A truly wonderful masterpiece not just for not just the men, but the women, and children too!"
It was great and is a must see.
"This film is undoubtedly the best in the franchise. If you're ever wondering whether or not to see it, my advice is to just ""Dew it."""
Good soldiers follow orders
Best of the prequels by far.

"Many prequel era movies are bashed, but Revenge of the Sith is overall a great movie with one of the most emotional endings in all of Star Wars. 10/10."
"I had a huge review written up, and then I had to tab over to verify my email address. My phone ate it.

So, to summarize - Do yourself a favor and watch this movie in the context thatnit was always meant to be. Watch the first two movies, then watch The Clone Wars, then watch this.

It might just help you to see why all of the crazy Star Wars fans are so passionate about the Prequel era. The Prequels are more than just the movies, and to ignore the context that leads to this movie is to do yourself a massive disservice.

That being said, you're going to resubscribe to Disney Plus to watch the second season of The Mandalorean anyway, so you might as well get context for Ahsoka's appearance there, too."
Best of the prequel trilogy. 100% would grant the rank of master.
"The greatest story ever told, better than the bible!"
"Truly a cinematic masterpiece. One that will, without doubt, go down in history as the best film of all time."
"The movie that breaks your heart. Honestly ruined the rest of my day after watching this movie because you can't help but root for Anakin even though you know exactly how it will go. 

A fantastic movie."
This is such an underrated movie. Sure some of the dialogue can get cheesy but it is still is sooo good and definitely worth watching a couple hundred times.
Amazing. Beautiful. Truly breathtaking
"My #1 favorite movie, endless re-watchability, everyone must see this at least once."
This has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember. The story is amazing and complex. The emotion is intense especially when it comes time for brothers in arms to fight each other. The dialogue can be weird sometimes but everything about this film overshadows that you the point where I never notice bad dialogue. 6/5 stars
Hello there. General Kenobi!
"The movie is at the absolute PINNACLE of greatness. It' calming, funny, scary, gives you goosebumps. It's sad and yet satisfying."
Best movie ever even out of all the movies they made
For the Republic! And r/prequelmemes!
This is a masterpiece of a film and the best of the prequel trilogy
A timeless classic. The crown jewel of the trilogy of a generation
A good clone follows orders
"Despite shortcomings of missing fanboys expectations of what they wanted to see at the time, this movie has proven to be the best in the entire Star Wars series. The script is an under appreciated masterpiece, tying up loose ends and ultimately leading towards the need for A New Hope."
An absolute master piece. After watching my shingles were cured and I learnt to walk again. I was previously completely smooth but have since grown enough hair for people to mistake me for a brown bear. My only complaint is the large amounts of sand throughout the movie.
"For the REPUBLIC!!
For the REPUBLIC!!
For the REPUBLIC!!
For the REPUBLIC!!"
ROTS is strong and wise and I'm very proud of it!
"Perfect, an absolutly brilliant movie that brings emotions and thrill"
Modern Day Greek Tragedy
The movie is one of the greatest star wars movies ever made. Ewan's role as obi-wan is perfect and the fight scenes and story are rich and beautfiful. 5/5
"I like this movie for many reasons, but this is the main one:


Because of Obi-Wan.



S"
The best movie ever. For the Republic
FOR THE REPUBLIC!!!!
"This movie is far and away, the greatest prequel ever made."
"If you don't like this movie, you're a hard-r clanker."
Such a fun movie that exceeded the expectations by the couple to come before it.
The final fight alone is a masterpiece of high stakes action and emotions but the rest of the movie is a fantastic build up to that conflict. This is the crown jewel of the prequel era.
Definitely the best of the prequels. Such a great movie!
Best star wars movie in the whole franchise.
"The perfect movie.  If you aren't watching this at least 8 times a day you're wasting your time doing whatever else.  I personally have it running on my TV, phone and laptop."
"This movie is one of my favorites of all time. I have watched it multiple times and I never grow bored of it. This movie really serves the characters that appear in the Original Trilogy well and fleshes out their backstories. On top of that, the entire franchise is a staple of Americana at this point and this is one of the favorites of the generation that will carry the franchise into the future."
Just plain old cinema greatness! It's one of the most quotable movies in cinema history and deserves its place at the golden throne!
One of my favourite films of all time. The only Star Wars film I rate higher than Rogue One.
"Oh, it's beautiful. One of the best movies I've seen. It's lore is deep but presentation is kept simple. This is where the fun begins"
Underrated masterpiece
One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.
This is the perfect movie. And only enhanced by clone wars
"I watched this movie as a child and thought it was fantastic. I Re-Watched it recently and still enjoyed it tremendously. The acting was good, the CGI stands up even today, and the plot was top notch."
Truly an under appreciated masterpiece by the masses. This film manages to tell a mature tale of betrayal and political scheming in an entertaining way for anyone to enjoy.
An utter masterpiece.
"In my opinion, this is the best star wars movie out there."
A masterpiece that magnificently reflects the danger of the dark side of the Force.
Good soldiers follow orders.
The Dark Knight Rises is an awful film
Amazing movie. The best of the prequel trilogy!
Loved it. I must have seen it at least 20 times. It was my favorite movie growing up and still is my favorite star wars movie to date. Everyone should see it.
"Great movie, open-ended, CGI is even more amazing, didn't expect that from Anakin oof. Good quotes and many memeable scenes, perfect (read as sad) end to the Clone Wars, makes you think about nowadays, as this saga has many stuff comparable to IRL (On the time of their release). 10/10"
you underestimate my power
Best movie ever made. Period
Every single shot every moment was interesting best star wars movie by far every model made me curious
Good soldier's follow orders
For the Republic!!!!
"Honestly, I though this movie was excellent before, especially given the problems Attack of the Clones left for it. BUT, having now watched The Clone Wars this movie has so much more emotion, feeling, and context. Plus, Hayden Christensen's acting is better than it first appears if you pay attention to the details. You can tell how tortured Anakin is through all of it and how much he's agonizing over everything internally."
Best light saber fights ever.
A fine addition to the saga.
Best Starwars Movie Hands Down!
The greatest Star Wars movie in all the aspects. CGI is not a problem for me.
It was the best movie ever.
Best film I've ever seen. I have the fondest memories of it from my childhood. The memes it spawned are just beautiful. Obiwan is just the best here. The best Star Wars film out there!
Easily the best of the Prequel Trilogy.
Empire Strikes Back may be the best Star Wars movie but this is by far the most fun. The lightsaber fights are amazing and the score is one of the best in the series. Ewan McGregor gives it his all in this and you can tell he's having so much fun.
Why is this movie great?..... Because of Obi-wan
Good soldiers follow orders
Hello there. General Kenobi. You are a bold one
"The epic, emotionally charged conclusion to the Clone Wars. Episode 3 was a hero, we just couldn't see it yet."
amazing movie a must see
"A masterpiece in filmmaking, with memorable quotes.  A great end to the Sequel Trilogy, and ties into the Original Trilogy with ease."
"Wow, the best Star Wars of the prequels. Better than all of the Disney Sequel Trilogy."
"This film is a cinematic masterpiece.  A tale of good vs evil, light vs dark, romance and betrayal it has it all.  A must see for any cinophile"
"It's easily my favorite of the Prequels and of the entire Saga. You can watch it by itself and the story stands strong. You can watch it with the rest of the Prequels and it's a fantastic finale. You can skip the first 2 Prequels and watch this immediately after Empire Strikes Back and it still works fantastically without the extra context.

This movie is a testament to George Lucas' skill as a world builder, a character creator, and a story teller."
This movie was an amazing conclusion to the prequel trilogy. It also works very well to set up the begining of the Original Trilogy. The emotionally charged ending is one of the best examples of emotional storytelling in cinema.
"Absolutely amazing, the movie is the perfection of star wars"
Gooooooooooooooooood
"A perfect conclusion to this trilogy. This film's content does a precise job of redeeming the first two films, as well as setting the stage for the original trilogy. Aside from that, the film's score, cinematography, and costuming show that the crew worked very hard on this film as well, which pays off. A Star Wars movie everyone should see, and will enjoy."
A fantastic film that shows Anakin's descent into the dark side as he struggles to understand the Jedi ways. I love the flow of this story to show how he becomes the infamous Darth Vader.
"Great film and best of the prequels! The space battle, story, and music was all fantastic. Despite the fact everything that happened on screen happened within 5-10 days. Anakin's heel turn and betrayal of the Jedi order and killing younglings only happened within 1-2 days of learning Padme was pregnant."
"Easily one of the most beautiful and emotionally profound movies out there. the raw emotion and grief at the ending is enough to make anyone cry. It's great how they also bothered to address moral issues in the movies as well, with showing how the war was pointless, how most politicians can be corrupted by power and greed and that ""The war represents a failure to listen."" The characters are all amazing, and the CGI is wonderful. Good soldiers follow orders."
It was very good. One of the best SW movies.
"Amazing movie! It is my fav Star Wars movie.Yes it has some dialogue issues and not that great cgi, however the plot was on point, respecting the lore and giving us amazing duels and moments that are still the first thing to remember  when you talk about Star Wars."
"Another film I went to see as a young child and was my favourite but as time went on this film could have done alot more than it did , not the worst film in the saga but certainly not the best."
Hands down has the best duels in the series.
Greatest movie of not only the entire series but of all time!!!
Truly the best Star Wars movie of all time. Clearly better than that one batmann movie no one ever cared about.
Absolute Masterpiece
Absolute masterpiece.
Best movie in the OT.
This is a thrilling movie with great action and great plot.
"It has its ups and downs, but i mostly like the overarcing story of the prequels."
bruh it was so spicy like that scene mmmmmmm nice
"Revenge Of The Sith is the most watchable movie out of the prequel trilogy but it is far from being a good Star Wars movie and even further from being a good movie. Bad acting, awkward line delivery, boring choreography, characters contradicting themselves, characters acting out of character, fan service that makes lines from the original trilogy make no sense, scenes that overstay their welcome, its got the whole bad movie package and more. If for whatever reason you do decide to watch Revenge Of The Sith, watch it ironically with friends, it's a so bad it's laughable movie. If you're going to watch it unironically and take it seriously however, it isn't a guilty pleasure because you will feel no pleasure, only guilt. Revenge Of The Sith is everything you shouldn't do when making a movie. If you're looking for a good Star Wars movie, A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is your best bet because it's definitely not here."
One of the best movies I've ever seen. Far better than the dark knight rises
Best Star Wars Movie hands down.
"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the Midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic.
He could save others from death, but not himself."
This movie gave so many emotions and tied in to the original very well
It was a cinematic master piece and it is one of the best things ever also dont watxh the sequels they are trash
"The movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen. It explains the fall of the republic and Jedi and the rise of the empire. It shows how we get some of our most iconic characters like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leah."
"RotS, while slightly better than the other prequels, is still filled with plot holes and bad acting."
"Revenge of the Sith is arguably the best film in the prequel trilogy. The special effects are crazy and the film ties in very well with the original trilogy. The script, the story and the acting improve a lot compared to 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' but the dialogues between Anakin and Padme are still lacking, the impression is that Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has not received good indications on how to interpret the character. The film is still very epic and the duels with lightsabers are spectacular."
"In my opinion as a non Star Wars fan, the best of them all."
It's one of the prequels. What did you expect?
The BEST star wars movie ever
It's quite possibly the best movie ever
so amazing. love it along with all of the memes it has brought.
Love it! Actors did a great job!
Best movie ever made. Creamed my pants every time obi wan spoke. If you don't like this movie you dont understand culture
It was pretty frickin great ngl
"amazing, a great conclusion to the era"
"Revenge Of The Sith, where do I begin, the cast are way better than they were in Attack Of The Clones and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is way better in this one. The reasons on why he's better is due to him having better dialogue which works well and it's quite a small thing but his facial expressions when he's taking with other characters show him to be quite an angry and annoyed character, not really shown as the whiny brat he was in Episode 2. Also, the fight scenes here are very fun and engaging not like the ones in Attack Of Clones, we get to meet some new villains and witness some brilliant fight scenes with them. Honestly, my favourite fight scenes throughout this movie would have to be the one where it's General Grevious Vs Obi-Wan Kenobi and the final fight scene where it's Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) vs Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) those fight scenes are always amazing to watch. Finally, the Revenge Of The Sith has got an amazing plot with a brilliant ending which links up perfectly to A New Hope. Overall, I'd honestly say this is my favourite prequel and it might be one of my favourite Star Wars movies, it's honesty worth the watch."
"Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars movie. There are some lines of dialogue that aren't very good but it is very enjoyable. I don't know how people can call this movie boring there is always some action and of course, that is a lot of fun."
"Yes, we see the rise of Darth Vader and not just the fall of Anakin Skywalker, but the fall of the Jedi. The clones troopers (that were introduced into the Star Wars universe in Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones) betray the Jedi by an order given to them by Darth Sidious known as Execute Order 66. This was an order to kill all the Jedi. Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi were our only survivors. Also we see Anakin's fear of losing Padme due to child birth, so Anakin is desperate to learn a power that no other Jedi could learn. Therefore he joins Palpatine in order to try and save his wife. But really in the end nothing works out for both of them."
That film was so good. I can´t wait to watch it again. The whole film was epic.
"Clearly the end of Lucas' vision for star wars, a perfect twist to the beginning of a space-epoque."
Love it but might be a little bit overrated
"Exciting and emotional conclusion to the prequel trilogy, it manages to make up for most of the previous movies flaws."
"TLDR a mediocre independent movie, but a crucial part to the entire Star Wars franchise.
The movie was kind of screwed from the start due to the ending, but it sorta worked out.
Fans (for the most part) like it, non-fans not so much. Probably because of the ridiculously amount of duels and how it wraps up the Clone Wars and a whole bunch of characters, which is emotional for people who followed it. 
For everybody else it's a warzone. It personally got better for me over time as I discovered little details about the plot (especially about the Emperor) and this support it gets from the outside makes the characters not necessarily well-written, but thoroughly written."
It's a great movie it really shows the darkness of the sith it's amazing I really would suggest watching it with the clone wars show it really shows how much anakin betrayed and how good of a person he actually was
"Revenge of the Sith delivers the best wrap up of a story that leads into the original trilogy. Despite knowing exactly what must happen for the storyline to keep its continuity, the film still excels in bringing jaw dropping sequences as well as beautiful writing. The tale of a long planned betrayal that swings the fate of the entire galaxy and brings about the end of a ultimately pointless war."
these movies may not have been better than the originals but I do believe that this one sums up what episodes iv-vi are about
"This is one of my favorite movies in the Star Wars trilogy. An extremely epic, yet devistating movie. Great actors as well."
"It was like biting into a grilled cheese sandwich that you just made only to realize that the cheese was made of gold, the bread was zesty, and somehow, there was perfectly cooked bacon in between layers of Fresh Tomatoes and lettuce.
This movie perfectly demonstrated how an empire came to be, I found the political side to genuinely interesting, character motivations that were sound and legitimate, and the best action scenes I have ever seen in any movie.
Right away, the viewer is brought into a thrilling space battle where we get to learn about the protagonists and we see the humanity in Anakin. The film shows how Anakin is shifted to the dark side which helps us understand his humanity and how he had enough left to come back to the light side many years later. The sound design is fantastic and there is a lot of clever dialogue. There is so much emotion in this movie and it is greatly helped by the superb acting of the actors. Honestly, I could talk about this movie for a while but to me, the main thing is that when I watch this film I always seem to enjoy it and all of its aspects intertwine very nicely.
In my opinion it's a great movie."
"By far the best movie of the Prequel trilogy. The film is not without it's flaws, but has a lot it tries to accomplish. It doesn't quite succeed on all counts, but it leaves the viewer with a tremendous appreciation for the imagination of George Lucas."
WAY better than Disney
"best of the prequels. Could be the fourth best film in the franchise. The pacing of the movie is pretty good compared to the previous 2. I feel as if the film doesn't hold up that well, when I watch it now. Only a few actors in the film seem like they know how to act. Being Sam Jackson and Ewan McGregor. The end fight scene is worth the watch alone. Simply a popcorn film for the family."
"Supera por mucho las dos anteriores, vemos un Anakin con el que simpatizamos mas con 30 minutos de pelicula que en todo lo que mostró en el episodio anterior.
La pelicula está en constante movimiento de principio a fin, un Obi-Wan increible y un duelo final vs Anakin que a mi parecer es el mejor de toda la saga. De las mejores peliculas de Star Wars, sin duda."
"Tied up the prequels well and linked the story to the original trilogy. Despite the movie being relatively lengthy, Anakin's turn to the dark side and the end of the Clone Wars with Grievous, seemed rushed and ill-explained. Visually, having been filmed mostly in front of a green screen, the film shows its age. The music is phenomenal, being some of the best in the entire Skywalker saga."
"After two bad prequels, the series is good good again."
This movie is my 3rd favorite in the franchise. Anakin hands down is the best character in Star Wars. The way you see Anakin slowly turn to the dark side is sad but also amazing how good Hayden Christensen did making you feel sad for the character. The fight scenes are amazing especially the Obi wan and Anakin fight and the opening fight scene. The dialogue can be a little bad at times but overall everyone kills and is a good movie
It is a cinematic masterpiece and it's my favorite movie 11/10
"I really like this one. While I do think it’s my bias toward Star Wars in general and the fact the the films enhanced by the Clone Wars CG show, I still like it. The effects are pretty good for the time. It’s pretty entertaining. The acting and writing is that good but I’ve come to except that from Lucas. I feel this is a guilty pleasure for me, second only to Con Air."
"It is hard to express how amazing this film is. It is a flying success in all its areas. The acting is near perfect, with Hayden Christiensen giving his most convincing performance as Anakin, and Ewan McGregor delivering an outright iconic Obi-Wan Kenobi. Together they sell you the brotherhood of these two characters so well that by the end, you're throwing your money at them begging for more. The plot is so engaging, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the events unfold, even though we've known for over 40 years what would happen. It'll have you laughing with the casually witty banter in the opening scene, and crying at the heartbreaking climax between Anakin and Obi-Wan. At the same time, John Williams creates some of his most iconic music since the originals. The sadness you feel as the orchestra and choir swell during Order 66 is immense. Throughout the film, the music is immersive, and plays a truly important role in the flow of the film. Lastly, this is a visually stunning film. The ILM team attempts some of their most ambitious effects to date, and the execution is perfect. The effects are flawless and convincing. Overall this is a truly great film. It is emotional, beautiful, and a perfect end to the saga. I think is is vastly misunderstood. This film, as well as the other prequels, were never meant to be like the originals. They're more poetic, more dramatic, and this film is the pinnacle of George Lucas' intentions. I rank it 3rd in the entire eleven film canon behind only A New Hope and Empire (of course). Even outside of Star Wars it is one of my favourite films of all time, it deserves some serious respect. It is a fun, exciting, heartbreaking story, and seeing the title scroll onto the screen at the beginning of the film always makes me smile. I truly do enjoy watching this film. Isn't that what makes a movie great?"
I remember this movie well. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever experienced in a movie. A missed opportunity. Avoid.
"Impressive, it is incredible that this film can move despite one already knows its end from before. For those who are looking for a movie identical to the first ones with a luke and a han only because you are not going to enjoy it, this movie is great for its history, not for its resemblance to the originals, for that you better go see episode 7 .."
"Favorite Star Wars of this series. Anakin has no enthusiasm, not a fan of his. Still a great ending and story."
"Revenge of the Sith is one of, if not the best movie within the skywalker saga. It is a dramatic ending to the prequel trilogy. The effects still hold up and it has the best lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars. There are multiple moments when you think about it deeper you get to see the true meaning of Anakin's saga. I would highly recommend!"
The best out of the prequels
We need more movies like this
"Better than the other two prequels, but not without its directorial shortcomings. I really like how this film sets up the originals. Definitely the darkest and most captivating of the prequels."
"Just incredible. Action, choreography, cinematography, dialogue, plot, characters, music, special effects & costume design at their best. My second favorite Star Wars movie, EVER."
A tragic and dramatic story with unusually good acting compared to the previous prequels that almost redeems them.
My favourite movie of all time!!
"While Rise of Skywalker nearly ruined its own trilogy, Revenge of the Sith nearly save its own. Lucas still doesn't have a real good grasp on story tone or plot tempo (two fairly important things for a director to control), he manages to create a finale that is not only far-and-away the most inventive and fun of the prequels, it's actually just good old-fashioned escapism. Performances are better (even Christensen), & the political thematics are gripping (""So this is how liberty dies…with thunderous applause."")"
"3538/5000
I will not make a real criticism but rather a counter argument against the haters. Let's start to say why I like this film: simply thanks to its good OST (at the same time John Williams) coupled with wonderful action scenes, a good representation of the conspiracies and political developments that there have been in course of our History (Republic [Roman, French, of Weimar] becomes Empire) and especially the great moments of emotions which begin little by little: Anakin does not want to drop Obi-Wan; Padmé reveals that she is pregnant; forgiveness of Anakin to Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, Order 66, Obi-Wan discovers the massacre of the Padawans, Vader strangles his wife, the fight between the former master and apprentice, Vader burns under the gaze of 'Obi-Wan and finally the simultaneous sequences of the tapering of the armor and the birth of Padmé! Special mention to the reply that each child must repeat when playing Star Wars; I will comment on them later.
Small parenthesis. Before attacking what is annoying with this film, let us launch into the Prelogy. According to my personal tastes: III> VI> IV> V> I> II with regard to the Star Wars saga. Although I'm indifferent to episode II and find episode I just ... cute, I have to defend the Prelogy. Admittedly, I do not believe that it would have been necessary to make a prequel but here it is: SW is a saga of film for child, whether you believe it or not. That explains the Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, Yoda the puppet, a bearded old fool, robotic comics-reliefs, etcteri etctera. And at the end of episode I, instead of growing up with the public of the Trilogy (as Harry Potter would have done), this episode is very childish (not immature, attention), you just have to listen to the music to to notice. On the other hand, the Prélogie, it grew with its fans. Episode II is for teens. And episode III is more adult. TO fans wanted to feel the emotions
they had but Lucas's goal was to introduce the new SW generation. And I'm not against it! That explains why the old people like the Trilo and the younger ones the Prélo.

Now ROTS!

I would cite many others but here it is, it is not critical wikiquote ...."
"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, es una gran película, la mejor de las precuelas, me atrevo a decir la mejor de la saga, George ha hecho un trabajo memorable en su dirección, guión y producción, fortaleciendo sus aciertos y sus debilidades. Los efectos visuales y el maquillaje han envejecido muy bien a pesar de los 15 años del estreno, por allá en mayo del 2005. La banda sonora de Williams ha sido de lo mejor que he escuchado en años, las actuaciones y los diálogos han mejorado con respecto a sus antecesoras, además de su gran ritmo en la narrativa.
Al lado más personal, está película me ha marcado desde mi infancia hasta hoy, le tengo un gran cariño, es un film oscuro, trágico, triste, dramático y emocionante a la vez, con un desenlace que refleja que no todo está perdido, que siempre hay un lado de luz en un camino lleno de miedo, maldad y oscuridad, eso se llama Esperanza."
The best episode among the prequel trilogy. Great to watch Anakin slowly succumbing to the dark side and ending up being Darth Vader.
"Good, George Lucas, good. Watch it. Watch it now.
Dew it."
Simply amazing. The best of the entire franchise and with epic and satisfying scenes.
The perfect ending and closure for the prequels! A must see!
"While the acting may be iffy at times and some of he effects look dated by today's standards, but the most Shakespearean of the Star Wars films is the darkest and most action packed or all the Star Wars films in existence, to its benefit."
"My favorite Star Wars movie so far because, I just love the Sith they’re my absolute favorite and in my head I’d rather be Darth Vader than Anakin Skywalker"
"Although still somewhat shaky, Revenge of the Sith is still LIGHTYEARS better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones thanks to it's gritty tone, performances, improved dialogue, and, as always, John WIlliams' score."
The holy grail of prequel memes.
"The best Star Wars movie by far, with skilled lightsaber combat, love relationship, and fear to the dark side, I give this movie 5 stars"
O melhor desse trilogia pequela
"This is the greatest Star Wars film of all time, EASILY!!!  So much is to be said about it.  It is the perfect conclusion to make the prequels better than they were before.  We have always wanted to know the story of how Anakin Skywalker became arguably the most powerful, recognizable, and feared Sith of all time: Darth Vader.  Everything from Anakin and Obi-Wan's friendship going into a downward spiral, to Anakin's emotion taking control, to the persuasion of Palpatine, to the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise is masterful and poetic.  But this movie has also inspired one thing that will forever dominate this film: the memes.  I mean ""Hello There,"" ""High Ground,"" ""Dew it,"" ""Fine Addition to My Collection,"" ""Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?""... I mean EVERYTHING is perfectly awesome.  And it ends with probably the BEST fight scene in the history of cinema on Mustafar.

HOLY CRAP GO WATCH THIS MOVIE OR YOU ARE WASTING YOUR LIFE!!!"
"One of the greatest ever! Perfectly concludes the Prequel Trilogy while laying out the backstories of Vader, Obi-Wan and Palpatine."
8.5/10 I think this is so underrated. The fight scenes are cool. The scenes where they execute order 66 are cool. I don’t get the hate.
"I think Lucas does a pretty good job tying up his story to the original trilogy, despite being uneven at times. It's entertaining and certainly a step up from Episodes I and II."
"Time has been kind to the Prequels. Following the Disneysasters, the forgiveness of Lucas has been justly accelerated. 
Revenge of the Sith was always the most beloved of the prequels, both for its story content and for its final referencing of the OT aesthetic.
Rewatching the films in chronological order, RotS truly becomes the linchpin of not merely the prequels, but the entire saga. It is the film that turns the little boy of two movies past irrevocably into the villain.  It is the film that justifies the shadowy Vader's 2 dimensionality for most of the OT.

Revenge of the Sith may be the favorite of only a few (but growing) fans, but it deserves such reverence."
Not only the best of the prequels but the best of the sequels extremely emotional but if you want to get the full weight of this movie watch the clone wars first
"This is the best performance for this movie in this prequel.George Lucas really captures his imagination in reality even though its a 2005 film but the CGI is better than the previous I hope Lucas will capture this story of how Anakin becomes Darth Vader.The moments with the clones, droids and systems of how the republic works.One of my problems in the movie was of how weak is the dialog for Anakins responses to others and the movie shown how weak was General Grevious even thought he is known to be the Jedi killer in the republic"
"The best of the prequel trilogy has the answer to how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Anakin's struggles with the dark side on full display, this is the most emotionally gripping film of the prequel trilogy. Too bad it took three movies to get it right."
A visual masterpiece with a strong storyline that saves the prequels from mediocrity
"Tragic incompetence. Terrible actor for ""Anakin"", deaf and blind casting, boring Regisseur."
One of my favorite movies
A great ending to the maligned but misunderstood prequel trilogy
"This Star Wars prequel was just ok. Hayden Christianson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie. The plot to the movie was alright, but it should've been better. The special effects and the action scenes were pretty cool. In my opinion, Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and this one were the worst Star Wars movies of them all. I wouldn't recommend them."
The best of the prequels.
"This is the best Star Wars movie I've ever seen. I don't think that I would like another Star Wars movie better than this one. I love every movie, but this one is my favorite. It really shows how Anakin becomes evil and turns in Darth Vader. I think it's very important to watch in the Star Wars Saga. It's probably the most important film of the main story IMO. Also, there's lots of action going on in this movie which is really fun to watch. There's so many lightsaber duels in it."
This film is grossly underappreciated and I honestly think it's  as good as the original trilogy the Anakin's character is handled a lot better in this movie an I really like his interaction between Anakin and obi wan you really get a feeling that they've become close friends over the course of the war which makes the conclusion of the duel on mustafar all the more emotional Anakin's fall to the dark side is also very well done as you actually understand him and even feel bad for him I think this movie is really good and it even makes the originals better
Best out of the Saga.
Top 3 star Wars movies & Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker is top 2 Characters in the entire movie franchise for me
"I can't lie, nostalgia brings this from four stars to five. But I think this is the star wars movie with the best story to tell, and although there are problems with the execution, that says a lot for this nearly 50 year old franchise."
esta estuvo bastante chula y ver al final al darth vader molo bastante
"This movie is amazing. It shows a perfect ending for the prequel trilogy.
It's a shame that they didn't show dark Anakin fighting other jedi."
lucas wasn't afraid to go dark however the dialouge is weird
"Revenge of the Sith is a satisfying albeit flawed conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy, with bombastic action, interesting narrative choices and solid acting despite the irregular dialogue prominent in the prequels."
Lucas’s vision comes full circle here... but I haven’t cared enough to this point and ultimately leads where you’d expect
"This one is a guilty pleasure of mine. Yes, it can be dumb. Yes, it can be cringey. But overlying all of that is rich emotion and gripping action. Also, GRIEVOUS! 89%."
One ofmthe bests of Star Wars. Spectacular from start to end
Such an underrated movie. Best fight scenes in cinema
"This one is a MUST see if you ever watched the first original trilogy. Watching the Prequel Trilogy will show what happened before Luke and Leia were born, before showing us how it ends. The ending was pretty sad, but it was still great! Some of them were funny as well from C-3PO and R2-D2."
Absolutely fabulous aside from some of hayden christensens performance
really dark film in the star wars world up there with the best
"E uno dei film più riusciti della saga, se non il migliore. Spettacolare visivamente, e accattivante, appassionante, riflessivo profondamente."
Hands down the darkest Star Wars film and the best movie in the prequel trilogy. This may not be the prettiest Star Wars movie to look at but it does have an amazing plot. Revenge of the Sith does a awesome job at showing Anakin Skywalker turning into Darth Vader.
"Dark, Fun, Amazing, and watchable is what Revenge of the Sith is compared to the other prequels."
"This film is exelent, this film does´t have a single and the sountrack is vary famous and is estremaly fine. The special effects are amazing for 1990."
Anakin's fall to the dark side felt rushed and extreme but overall this is an excellent Star Wars film and a redeeming end to the prequel trilogy whose first two films were pretty poor.
My absolute favorite movie of all time
"Regardless of its flaws, the Revenge of the Sith is a pretty fun and exciting addition to the ever-growing Star Wars franchise."
"Incredible movie, incredible Star Wars movie, my personal favorite. A must see. Rounds out the prequel trilogy with precision and drama in the style of a Shakespearean tragedy."
"The prequels, in general, get too much hate. This is the best of them. I would argue this film is actually better than Return of the Jedi. Anakin's story of transformation into Darth Vader is a great one."
o melhor filme das prequels
"Definitely the best of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, even though it suffers from bad writing and dialogue. This is the only Star Wars prequel that actually has one moment where the characters show how they feel without just outright saying it and moving along the plot in a lazy and robotic way."
"After finding the stumbling blocks early on, Revenge of the Sith manages to hit plenty of high notes, even if it still insisted on adding in a ton of flips to the lightsaber battles. Pour one out for Plo Koon, boys."
"this movie gave life to millions of memes, it's not perfect but still incredibly fun to watch even if it has without any doubts its problems. the final duel on mustafar is to this day the best lightsaber fight ever portrayed on screen."
Bored by lazy over use of lifeless green-screens and the millions of overly long Lightsaber fights and
"I regret seeing it in a Florida theater with family. Mr. Lucas produced a semi-favorable, action-packed space drama. Samuel Jackson as a chief Jedi were among the best performances, but there was not enough of him. 
    The Revenge of the Sith isn't a fulfilling closure of George Lucas pre-sequel series. I actually wanted to leave mid-way and wait in the lobby for my family to finish enduring it.
    Most of the characters seemed underwritten without knockout performances. The film becomes violent and depressing with scenes that might be too unbelievable for space fantasies, including the birth of Lela and Luke. It became the end of my Star Wars era. I didn't followed up watching the recent Disney sequels."
Second best star wars movie
Best of the Prequel Trilogy!!!!!!!!!
"Best of the prequels ... that pretty much sums it up. Still lacking in terms of good writing, but the actings good, the actions good, the plot is great, and the finale is fantastic."
You'd underestimate its power.
"Revenge of The Sith took what many complained about and fixed it, and gave Star Wars fans a proper ending to the Prequel Trilogy and made the Originals look even better."
"Say what you want, but I actually enjoyed this one out of the prequels.

The action constant from beginning to end and enough time is spent on storytelling. A lot of the boring council scenes were cut out and the clones weren't portrayed as incompetent buffoons.

Of course, the action is all surface-level as we all know how the original trilogy ends. But that gives us enough reason to turn off our brains and enjoy a good flashy show.

4/5. I debated on a 3.5 but decided to give George Lucas a benefit of a doubt. Doesn't make my all-time favorite list, though."
"This is definitely my favourite Star Wars movie. There isn't a dull moment, it's action packed with room to breathe and we get to see the fall of a Anakin skywalker. This film is a must see!"
alright bust terrible at the same time
GARBAGEEEEEEEEEEE LIKE EVERY STARWARS MOVIE
"FUCK THIS SHITTY ASS MOVIE, I'M OUT!"
"Even better than the episode 1 and 2 and I liked both those movies.  While at times I felt some of the acting was a little high school drama it didn't take away from the transformation we see in Anakin and how he is easily being pulled to the Darkside.  We see him struggle with Love over Power and lose to power.  In an epic final battle sequence, we watch the Empire and the Sith destroy the Jedi and Rebellion.  Obi-wan and Anakin have one of the best battles in the Star Wars movies and yet at times I still really love the Episode 1 final fight between Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-wan vs Darth Maul.  But not to be left out in episode 3 we see Mace Windu vs Emperor Palpatine in a brilliant battle scene.  And Yet while the jedi battle scenes are far better in these origin story movies all three fall just short of the original trilogy BUT a must watch for any Star Wars fan.  Episodes 1 - 6 are the best watch the new Episodes 7 thru 9 will greatly disappoint and make you hate Disney for killing Stars Wars for every.  A glimmer of Hope with the Solo film and Rogue one, both solid movies with room for growth in the new Solo Franchise."
"Begining is awesome,middle is still pretty good and the ending is perfect!
And Jesus,the fight coreography is the best from the franchise.
Only problem was Anakin becomming Darth Vader,it was a bit squeezed in..."
"This movie is amazing, I love it. A thousand times better than the tragedy that is The Last Jedi. If you haven't watched it, please do yourself a favor and watch it."
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
Finally the prequels are able to reach their full potential on this thrilling conclusion to the prequel trilogy.
"Star Wars Episode III is by far the movie in the Star Wars Saga that has divided the fanbase the most, some think it is good, while others think it is bad, now lets get to my opinion, personally I think its a great movie that is worth rewatching and I would definitely recommend it to others, there are more pros than there are cons, Some of the pros include the Camera work, It is simply amazing, the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan, and near the end where Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia, now lets talk about the cons.. First Of All. the story is overlooked due to the battles and deaths, Order 66, etc, and It also goes on for quite too long, as a conclusion I would give Star Wars Episode III 84/100, It's a great movie worth rewatching, but there are better Star Wars Movies Out There."
"It still has some of the downfalls of the previous films, but it is definitely a huge step up.  Lots of fun all around, and possibly the best lightsaber fight in the saga."
"Despite the poor dialogue, this movie makes up for it with some pretty awesome fight scenes. George did a great job to show Star Wars fans how Anakin Skywalker, once a poor slave boy on Tatooine, became the evil Darth Vader. To imagine that a hero like Anakin could become evil in such a short matter of time is amazing and pretty saddening too. The ""You were the Chosen One!"" scene always makes me cry. After watching the Original Trilogy and then this movie it's really sad to think of what Ben Kenobi was thinking when Luke asks ""How did my father die?"". And to top it all off, the wonderful score by John Williams and the LSO. Just a remarkable piece in the Skywalker Saga."
As the long awaited masterstroke of Lucasarts it is what it is; a worthy explaination of things and in the Star Wars Universe. Solid acting performances and a great story make this film really well worth seeing.
"It's decent. Doesn't make the mistakes that the previous two films make. The writing is not as bad. The lightsaber battles are really entertaining. I love the Order 66 sequence. The negatives for this film include a couple of clunky dialogue moments, bad CGI and Anakin is still annoying. Overall good movie."
"The hate is silly, this is my favourite star wars movie ever!"
"I don't get people who say it's the best Star Wars movie, ok, ok - maybe it's not that bad but it's not good either."
"Amazing ending to the prequel trilogy, only bad thing was Christian's acting!"
Best Star Wars Film!!
"It's not a perfect movie, still has its awkward moments, but it's the best of the Prequels, one of the best in the saga and has one of the if not the greatest Lightsaber fight ever."
"Known as the good prequel, Revenge of the Sith is a satisfying conclusion to the prequels and offers good action and a decent story. It does take itself a bit too seriously but it makes up for it in not terrible dialogue."
"The film we've been waiting for! We finally see the transformation of Darth Vader
! The visuals are perfectly balanced with the action and the darkness heightens the fun. Hayden still needed to step up his game though."
Best Star Wars ever
"This is an example of the actual story is better than the actors, the director and even the script.
( Sounds a little confusing )"
"Suggested Audience: Everyone (except young children) |
Critical Rating: A |
Nostalgia Factor: Insane |
Viewings: 4+ |
Detail: Certainly the best of the prequels from a critical perspective, Revenge of the Sith culminates in truly dramatic fashion. Epic battles, terrible tragedy, and a satisfying link to the original trilogy. This film offers much and considering it's scale, it deserves a watch from most moviegoers."
"The first & best Star wars history!! Really glad of this film, all the film was excellent, true sorrow of the ending but also great joy, a true Star Wars film. The clone wars, the importance of the story, Anakin turn to the dark side, the love story, the epic duels of Lightsabers, the great epic musics of SW universe, the good special effects, greatest characters  & most of all : the Darth Vader's birth! The connection of the original films was so excellent . The prequel trilogy is not perfect but is better than the others SW movies and thanks to Revenge of the Sith! Thank you George Lucas for this films!"
"The best of the three prequels, full of emotion and awesome lightsaber action!"
"Coming off the disappointment of the first two movies of the Prequel Trilogy Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith feels like a comfortable return to the feel of the Original Trilogy. Of course, ROTS has its flaws, it is still ultimately a prequel movie and it shares many sins with its predecessors, but I would argue that it succeeds much more often than it fails. The story that we had been promised ever since George Lucas put a IV on the title crawl of the original Star Wars was finally being told, the seduction of Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Side and the Rise of the Empire and Darth Vader. Ultimately the parts of this movie that do best deal with these plot points. The Characters and the plot have a major upgrade from the last few films, you care about these characters here. You feel their emotions and conflict. ROTS has some of the most emotional scenes of any Star Wars movie, it was the first one I ever cried at and still consistently gives me the most feelings. It's a beautiful movie and accompanied by what I usually consider to be John William's best work. The action and landscapes are some of the best of the entire series, and the Climactic Duel between Master and Apprentice that is hinted at back in 1977 is a work of art. It is my #1 favorite lightsaber duel of all time, no contest. While there are some scenes that go nowhere and plot points that make me want to tear my hair out. (SHE LOST THE WILL TO LIVE?!?!) Ultimately, I place this movie very high on my list of favorite Star Wars movies, and it deserves every bit of it. -Rhenn"
"Out of the prequels, the best, out of all the Star Wars movies, definitely Top 3 for me. That's controversial definitely and many would disagree but the sheer enjoyment I get out of watching this movie is unrivalled to any other Star Wars movie. This is the film I grew up with, so it'll always have a place in my heart. After watching episode 2, you kind of already know where the films heading but it's such an enjoyable watch. It's leaps in bounds above the previous 2 films in terms of special effects/CGI, a massive improvement and one which definitely benefits the film. Due to the improved visual aspect it holds up compared to modern standards which Episode 1 + 2 fail to do. The thing I loved most about this film is the lightsaber combat, it's significantly better than its predecessors. The choreography is excellent and watching it gives off an amazing sense of enjoyment when watching the Jedi perform these new moves with the lightsaber. This advancement is one I hoped for since it wasn't the greatest in Episode 1 or 2. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan will go down as my favourite character from Star Wars because of this film alone, he's amazing and manages to make what is some poor writing at times seem not as bad. This is a film I will keep coming back to for years to come, whether it's due to it having so many iconic moments, or whether it's to see a action packed film, it'll probably as my favourite Star Wars movie forever"
"One of my favorite movies. It had amazing lightsaber duels, amazing battles and it is worth watching."
"For some reason, I have always loved this film. Maybe the disappointment from the other prequels made this stand out, but I love this film. With the best fight scenes in the entire franchise, impressive visuals, excellent character arc for Anakin Skywalker, and little focus on complicated stories and characters. This is a great Star Wars film. It feels like A New Hope with its simple story ideas, memorable characters, and dark tone and atmosphere. While some will not like this film, I highly recommend this to all Star Wars fans."
"Revenge of the Sith is my favourite of the Star Wars movies, although I can admit that it is not anywhere near perfect like the first two are. This is mainly because of how blandly many of the lines are delivered, particularly by Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala. Although Hayden Christiansen has been criticized for this, I actually don't mind his performance as Anakin Skywalker. By the end of the movie he became Darth Vader - a cold tyrant who ruled over an entire galaxy with a (literal) iron fist, so I feel as though his emotionless delivery was intentional and brilliant, especially since his emotions only really come out when he's angry and giving into the dark side. Besides, Revenge of the Sith has plenty of action sequences and emotional moments worth an 11/10 that make up for the 7/10 delivery."
It was fine. Cool concept and action I guess. Bad action though. I like the darker tone.
Best prequel.  And best lightsaber battle ever
"The third, and final installment to the prequel trilogy is an epic comeback for the franchise. ""Revenge of the Sith"" features more cohesive action sequences and is often poignant enough to overwhelm the once again cringe-worthy romance between Anakin and Padmè. There are many iconic characters brought to life, and the final battle is a spectacle, still not as good as the original, but far better than its two immediate predecessors.

80/100"
"Amazing, colorful and full of inovation movie that undoubtly gets the high ground on all of star wars trilogies and eventhoigh the dialogue is not that good, it's memeable so 5/5"
The best of the prequels and maybe number two on my favorite Star Wars list after Empire Strikes Back! I'm not too crazy about their choice for Anakin (he's sounds to whiny) and I expected the character to be a more powerful looking man. The story was okay not the direction I would have chosen but it didn't bore me. The action was all that and what I expect for Star Wars. I would have given it five stars but Anakin knocks it down a peg.
This is the best star wars movie ever <3
One of my favorite films of all time and by far the best film in the skywalker saga!
Easily the best Story of any of the Star wars films even if ESB is still better as a film overall!
"Apart from some cringy dialogue lines given to the actors, Revenge of the Sith caps off the tragic story of Anakin Skywalker and his transition into Darth Vader (his rise and fall).  The film is packed with many of the best action scenes and visuals in ALL of Star Wars.  Hayden Christensen plays Anakin's transition well, and brings us some of the most memorable fights and visuals as a newly transformed Darth Vader.  The soundtrack is as amazing as ever.  Even after watching this film countless times, it manages to remain as a very emotional film, more so than any other Star Wars film, as we witness the fall of the republic and the many characters we loved."
This is one of the most good examples of a GREAT MOVIE  🎥 A LENGENDARY ONE ☝️. This is one of my favorite one of Star Wars maybe the 2nd one
Only the last hour is good. Still terrible acting and dialogue throughout the movie.
It was the best of this trilogy :)
Underrated film. The prequel trilogy is better than the Disney sequel trilogy.
La venganza de los Siths es una gran película que nos relata el ascenso de los Sith y del imperio
"The least terrible of the Star Wars prequels, if for no other reason than things happen in it.  Revenge of the Sith still suffers from the same problems as its two predecessors, but it's alleviated somewhat by Ian McDiarmid wonderfully hamming it up as the Emperor.  McDiarmid's performance is, without question, the one saving grace of this trilogy."
"Hello There,





General Kenobi"
"Pros: I think that this is easily the best out of the prequel trilogy. They fix the dialogue for the most part because there were some lines I didn't like. I think this movie had the best cinematography before the force awakens came out. This movie has the action of any star wars movie. The fast pacing works and the movie never slows down.  I like that Goerge Lucas wasn't afraid to make this movie dark and the dark tone works. I think that Obi-Wan and Yoda are great and the best they have been in the prequel trilogy. I think that they fixed Anakin until the end.  Jar Jar doesn't speak at all. The opening scene was great because it felt like the originals again. I like the rematch against Count Dooku because the choreography was so much better. General Grevious is great and I like the music for General Grievous a lot and the score is the second-best in the entire saga. I like the way that Palpatine is revealed and the way Anakin came to the fark side was well done. I like the mythos that Palpatine tells Anakin. The lightsaber fight was at the best that StarWars besides for one fight. The general Grevious fight is great. Order 66 was handled very well and the emotion hit me when all those Jedi died. The emotion hits you in this movie. I like how Yoda sensed it and killed his stormtroopers and Chewbacca's return was great and I like everything on the Wookie planet.  You could really feel the emotion when Obi-Wan found out Anakin turned to the dark side. The lightsaber fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the best lightsaber fight in any Starwars movie. You can feel the emotion and this is the best Choreographed fight in all of StarWars. Especially when Obi-Wan lets Anakin burn. The fight between Yoda and Palpatine was great.  This is probably one of the most rewatchable StarWars movies. It is tied with the Return of the Jedi in quality and rewatchabillity. The only good part of the end was Yoda saying Qui Gon Jinn could teach Obi-Wan more about becoming one with the force and the villains winning.

Cons: They didn't fix all the dialogue because there was the occasional bad dialogue and for some reason towards the end some of Hayden Christian's line delivery was awful. The lightsaber fight between for Jedi and Palpatine was pretty bad because three out of four of the Jedi were just standing there. Padme had a horribly acted death and her dying of a broken heart was stupid. Darth Vader in the suit was disappointing because him saying Noooooooooooooo was so bad. The ending was so bad that it takes you of the film. I feel like General  Grievous should have killed a Jedi because he is known as this Jedi killer and he wasn't quite as intimidating and Anakin should have killed more Jedi. I think that they needed just a tiny bit more in this film.

Despite its flaws, the movie is still pretty awesome. This movie is a come back from the last two movies and the best since the original trilogy. This is the most underrated Starwars movie and I think people don't appreciate it because they assume it is like the other two prequel films. This was my favorite Starwars movie as a kid but it is overshadowed by 3 other films.  
It is very entertaining and rewatchable.
This is truly the story that George Lucas wanted to tell and I'm gonna give this movie a (B)"
Greatest star wars film of all time for me. Loved all of it.
The best among the prequels
"This could have been a classic with better casting and less CGI. Hayden C is too fresh faced, too whiney and too boy band, to be the Annakin. Someone else, perhaps a bit older and with a strong presence would have made such a difference to this film. The CGI is very dated and it was shame real locations, real models and real people were not used more. Palpatine was outstanding and the overall story solid (even if Annakin went from good guy to bad guy in one scene, WWE style). If only this were made in the 80s it would have looked better!!"
the best star wars movie
Perhaps the the best prequel Star Wars film is Revenge Of The Sith. It will leave you absolutley stunned with its dramatic story and ending.
Best star wars movie.
"emocionante, denso, personagens bem desenvolvidos, lutas de sabre fenomenais."
"Though there is a lot to criticize in the prequels, RotS is really fun to watch. The sword fights are great though Grievous sword fighting style looks silly.

The end of the movie is amazing. The fights are great, the feels are strong. The dialogues feel natural.

I loved it when I was a kid and still love it today"
"I wish this movie was 20 minutes shorter. There's some stuff in the middle that makes it long winded. The arena fight took too long. However, it was a lot better than the episode II."
"Good grief it just keeps on going as one of the worst decisions to have ever been made by a franchise owner. If Lucas admitted this was made for no other reason besides outright unapologetic greed then I might be willing to accept its existence. 100% of the casting is dead on wrong. It's way too serious. It's a documentary on a total buffoon fumbling about in menace trying to cry his way out of living up to the standards of one of the darkest overlords in cinema. And it completely fails. There isn't a single redeeming second of this insult to the eyes. It even provides a sound clip that was overlaid in the remake of Return of the Jedi that totally trashes the epicness of the final scenes! It absolutely could not have been more damaging to the saga unless it was episode 1 or 2 which are astonishingly WORSE than this one! It would take serious effort for any living director to have made a worse set of prequels. It simply cannot be done except in a dark corner of the twilight zone where the prequels are just a re-release of the holiday special - a torturous blight on cinema I would rather watch a thousand times before admitting these prequels exist. Some day I promise I will hold a funeral service just for Star Wars. All due to the ruin these prequels have done to the saga and the remasterings of the originals. Lucas' failure, like Obi-Wan's is now complete."
"This film is arguably the best of prequels, and easily top 3 out of the 9 films that make up the Skywalker Saga. Revenge of the Sith carries the spirit of Star Wars quite well. Ewan McGregor was born for his role as Obi Wan Kenobi, and the visuals are still great even 15 years later."
best star wars movie just awesome plain and simply awesome
"Epic, dark, intense and dramatic, with the story we have been seeing for years, Revenge Of The Sith provides a great closure to the prequels and makes us understand the total arc of Anakin Skywalker's passage to Darth Vader."
The best of the prequels
"In the greater context of star wars properties this movie holds up better, than individually as a film. The experienced is greatly enhanced by the Clone wars animated series from 2008-"
No word for it.It is absolutly amazing with some logical mistake!!!
A great conclusion to a great trilogy I'd say it's better than Empire Strikes Back
The opening battle has that retro Star Wars feel and its dark story is enough to draw you into the movie. Definitely the best of the prequel trilogy and worthy of canon.
Personal favorite Star Wars movie
The best prequel out of the 3. Also has probably the best lightsaber battle of all the Star Wars movies
The best of the middle trilogy by far. not as good as the first trilogy though. A great transition between the two.
"Best Star Wars movie ever, evrything is great - story, charaters, visuals and music and finally emotional impact of Anakin's fall to the dark side."
"This is my favorite of the saga! The problem with this movie is you need to not care or acknowledge certain points of the story, instead just realize the entertainment is already there"
"Listen, Im a big OG star wars fan! and i hate star wars episode 1 and 2, But this movie i actually liked! pretty good acting and action sequences!
i like it 7/10"
"Muito bom, melancolico, nos mostra com maestria a queda de Anakin Skywalker para o lado sombrio e sua transformação em Darth Vader."
This is the best Star Wars movie. Change my mind
"While it still suffers from many of the same problems that the other prequels had, it manages to bring some entertainment to the table and was interesting to watch."
Great clone wars action on Utapu.
The best of the frisa trilogy
Greatest Star Wars movie of all time. So emotional and has such a big climax.
I have no idea why this movie is hated
Best Star Wars movie ever. The character arc is just perfect. PREQUELS ARE THE BEST
"A must see, not perfect but the best of the prequel trilogy. This is WHY we all love the first Trilogy with Luke and Han. This tells the story we all wanted to know for years, just HOW Anakin Skywalker fell from grace to become Darth Vader and how Palpatine took over control of the Republic. Some did not like aspects of the trilogy such as Jar Jar or Hayden's acting, but those are small things IMO. Over all story line and arcs are good."
great storyline but poor rendition.
"As someone who sees Star Wars as the story of Anakin Skywalker, this movie gives me everything I want. From the large scale battles if the clone wars to the tragic fall of the chosen one"
This is the Star Wars we've been waiting in terms of the prequels!  Story ties it altogether 👍
Absolutely breathtaking movie that everybody must see.
Excellent ending for the prequel trilogy which brings more meaning to the fall and eventual redemption of Darth Vader.
"One of my favorite SW films, and by far the best SW prequel film."
"7/10. Alas, though George Lucas failed to reach the thrilling heights of his original sci-fi saga, at least he concluded his involvement with Star Wars with a somewhat-redeeming final effort. What elevates this final chapter above other entries in the prequel saga is how it ties together the old and the new; the final act of this film bridges two eras in a bittersweet, narratively plausible way. Watching Anakin's descent into the dark side would have been far more worthwhile had they cast a better actor than Hayden Christensen in the role. Ewan McGregor was good, and Ian McDiarmid puts on a spotlight performance, completing the transformation of suspicious Senator Palatine into the fearsome Darth Sidius. As to be expected, the special effects were jaw-dropping, just as the writing was mediocre at best (and cringe inducing at worst). It is the best movie of the prequels, but still might not stand up with Return of the Jedi, the worst of the original series."
"This movie is just horrible especially when you compare it the actually enjoyable original Star Wars movies. Revenge of the Sith is filled with clunky dialogue, boring and bland characters we're forced to watch for ninety minutes and it just hops from appealing action scene to appealing action scene. All in all this movie has no redeeming qualities about it and you shouldn't waste your time with it."
"Way better than 1 and at times better than 2, but wow did Hayden Christensen portray Anakin Skywalker as whiney.  Managed to make the ultimate movie villian into a cry baby.  Gotta mostly blame Lucas for this.  I've been watching the Clone Wars animated series and I gotta say that they portray Anakin Skywalker much, much better."
Best Star Wars movie ever!
Awesome film now I finally figure out where Darth Vader came from the order 66 scene is very shocking when I first saw it.
I like the lightsaber battles
Best Star Wars movie. Iconic. Perfectly Made. Most quoted movie of all time.
É um filme fantastico o melhor da segunda trilogia (priquel) e o terceiro melhor filme da saga Star Wars na minha opinião
"In 2005, Star Wars was vastly popular.  This film helped to establish a backstory for several games, books, fan ideas, and other tie-ins.  The film itself is a bit over reliant on CGI, too hammy with the love scenes, has one too many political schemes, and is often disappointing. (like Kit Fisto's death scene!)  But, it being an exercise in world building fantasy, the supplemental material, and being a George Lucas made Star Wars film (which usually means a new interesting technical idea) makes it a little easier to suspend disbelief."
"Good Stuff: Feel's a lot like an OT star wars movie, The long take beginning, The lightsaber duels, The action, the music, the casting, another really good ending.

Bad Stuff: Anakin's dark side fall feels slightly rushed, and again Yoda isn't used very well, and neither is grevious. ( A good example of both of these characters used well is clonewars)"
"Awesome! Fun story, great visuals and the freakin birth of Lord Vader."
Amazing I love this film <3
"One of the best star wars movies and always enjoyable to watch. Some people will never forgive the prequels, but this one tones down the cringey love dialogue (though I concede it still can hurt once in a while) and other campy features. I never get bored with this one"
This is when Star Wars was good
The best of the 3 prequels for sure....watching Anakin give in to the dark side is heartbreaking even though you know it's coming and it has been coming for three movies.
"Yes, the prequels are still shit but Revenge of the Sith is probably the most emotional and heart-breaking movie of the entire saga. Everyone knows Anakin will become Darth Vader yet it's still extremely thrilling to watch. Largely due to incredible performances by Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and the ever so moving soundtrack of John Williams."
"Revenge of the Sith was the incredible culmination of two medium films with slow development. Even though we know the outcome of the story, viewers and left heart-broken to see the fall of the Jedi Order and the ascension of Darth Vader. Unlike its predecessors, the movie is exhilarating. Lightsaber fights and combat scenes were amazing. Hayden's Christensen acting even got [a little] better. By the end, you understand that it was the prequels have long been thought of by their creator, who unfortunately should have surrounded himself better to write and direct these films."
GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
Incredible movie. I grew up with this film and love the answers to all questions as to how everyone falls into their respective places in Star Wars A New Hope.
Best of prequels and right up there with all the originals.
Best of the prequels. Despite wooden dialogue the movie is fairly solid.
"Truly the best of the bad Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith doesn't make a whole lot of sense, both when viewed as self-contained, and when seen as a part of the Star Wars whole, but at least Lucas bothered to put a whole movie in here."
"Es Una Película Larga Pero Tiene Muchas Escenas De Acción Con Sables De Luz Que Son Excelentes, La Trama Es Muy Buena Y Ágil Pero Si No Eres Fanático Posiblemente Tengas Escenas Aburridas, Los Personajes Son Excelentes Junto Con Los Efectos Especiales"
"I thought it was good, it sometimes was a bit boring, but most of the time you were very exited to find out what happens next."
Best star wars movie to date. Very dark and doesn't hold back. Captures the fall of the jedi very well and the rise of darkness in the galaxy. The relationship between Obi  Wan and Anakin is very well done and the casting choice is amazing. The dialogue could use some work but for the rest a classic wonderful movie.
Ian Mcdiarmid and Ewan Mcgregor help redeem this movie with its incredible acting. Lightsaber duels in this movie are fantastic
Emocionalmente intensa. La mejor de toda la saga.
This movie is an absolute blast. It basically says who cares let's just have fun. It is action packed and the best Star Wars movie of them all.
"Best Star Wars Movie.
Dark. Cool. Sad."
Revenge of the Sith brings this convoluted era of Star Wars to an emotionally satisfying conclusion.
"The best Star Wars movie since 1980, and even better than the new ones."
"It's disappointing to see the audience score at 66% for this film. This is not only the best of the prequels but one of the best in the entire series. Putting the cheesy love story to one side, the rest of the film is fantastic! The story is suitably dark the light sabre action is great. We see the transformation of Anakin, The end of Dooku and Windu and the emergence of Palpatine. What more could you want? I admit that when the prequels first hit the big screen I wasn't sure how I felt about them because nothing could top the original trilogy for me but as the years tick by and after watching Disney's trilogy I appreciate just how good George Lucas is at developing a story. I so wish he kept the rights to Starwars and produced episodes 7/8/9."
"Honestly, amazing. One or two dumb things, like including Chewbacca working with Yoda. But an amazing way to end the trilogy and bring everything together"
By far the best out of the prequels it was fun and exciting and I thought it was very cool seeing the making of earth Vader and personally the best appearances of obi wan and yoda.
To me still meh. But compared to the others before it.....this is amazing. After having to rewatch the phantom menace and attack of the clones .....this seemed like such a good movie....until compared to the others. But just because it went away from the rest of the movie a little...eh....I will give it at least 3 stars.
"Other than the Lucas's dialogue which ended Christianson's career, a solid Star Wars film"
"Great movie, closes the chapter on Vader's origin"
Arguably the best movie in the saga and one of the best movies of this decade
great action sequences! no jar jar lines! mace windu is not lame this time!
"The best of the prequel trilogy. Anikan and Obi-Wan's relationship is the best part of this movie, and Palpatine is an absolute standout. It has without a doubt the best lightsaber action of all the Star Wars films, and it impressively ties the original trilogy and prequel trilogy together. Dialog and over-use of CGI might be the only issues this film has. This film saved the prequel trilogy in my opinion."
"After watching Disney rubbish movie. This is really a damm good movie. At least the lightsaber fight was damn good. At least the story make sense. At least Obiwan was really convincing. At least the space fight is really good. At least the storm trooper die. At least Anikin Skywalker can be defeated. At least Jedi(s) are powerful but they still die. And all Jedi(s) has their strength and weakness, they each have different roles and is very clearly shown in the movie. Disney's Star Wars is... plotless, illogical, breaks all physics, no continuity from previous 6 movies (plus Rogue One). No idea why Rey Space Jesus was ever needed to go through 3 movies when she could single handedly just destroy the entire Universe in the first 5 mins of the film. She can literally do anything. Teleport, heal people, bring dead people back to life, do Jedi mind trick, lift entire mountain range basically just do everything and anything she wants. Disney Star Wars is... just wasting people's time, it's rubbish. Its not inspiring and its almost just illogical (poor) action. Even the action sequence is BAD... REALLY BAD. I give George Lucas  STAR WARS 10 out of 5 stars. For being logical, consistent and good fight sequence."
"Lots of saber duels, lots more of action and nicely rounded off Anakin's turn to Vader"
"Superb! Outstanding! Mind-blowing! Epic! 
I ♥️ Star Wars ♥️"
This movie has a perfect mix of emotional and thrilling moments and it has everything you want to see in Star Wars film. My personal favorite Star Wars movie.
"Though it was sometimes a bit bland, ROTS is the greatest prequel, and I enjoyed the vast battle scenes, seeing order 66 play out was tragic, and it only continues to wrench the hearts of viewers of the clone wars."
"In my opinion this is the best Star Wars movie, and not by a slim margin."
"An amazing, thrilling movie full of stunning action and dazzling visuals. One of the best Star Wars movies."
Love this movie so much
"Terrible Script, but the best memes and Lightsaber choreography came from this movie."
"Very intriguing climax to the Anakin Skywalker fall from grace from the ""light side"" to the ""dark side"" (or falling into his shadow side and it takes over him). Sometimes a bit weak, but an emotional ending to the trilogy."
"The best episode in the prequel series by far in which it seems that George has taken all the criticism levied against the previous films and rectified them in this entry. From the action to the music to even the story, the film improves on every aspect of the previous entries and quite wonderfully concludes the trilogy which fits in smoothly into the original films. This is what star wars is about"
Best of the new trilogy
"This is my second favourite Star Wars film. It is just perfect in anyway, but I still like New Hope more"
"Really good,amazing movie."
It was good and I loved the plot and suspense of the movie best of the prequels
"Apart from The Phantom Menace, this had the best Lightsaber battle. A great ending to a great trilogy. Bittersweet to be sure."
Good round of to the prequels. Obi Wan vs Vader. Yoda vs Sidious. Windy death. Really good movie.
"I guess this review might be a bit biased since i prefer recent movies to old ones  and that I was really young when I watched it, but no matter what, the plot of this movie is absolutely out of this world. I loved the lightsaber duels and all the action sequences. I never really care much for acting, so I didn't really have a problem with it. But it never lets you get bored. Palpatine and the clone wars is what I love from the movie the  best, but there are too many thing to like about it and that's why it gets the all-out rating from me."
"It's Darth Vader's origin, the moment he falls to the dark side an important event in a movie that has it problems but shows how change befell the galaxy far far away. I like it especially Kenobis shines bright in the prequel triology and Hayden really brings it home after a rocky start in the triology."
"It's a storyline that follows a weak one from its predecessor. Coupled with a horrible ending, this movie disappoints. Ewan McGregor is stellar and some lightsaber scenes are cool. But prepare for an arsenal of disappointments, i.e., Yoda, Padme, Anakin, Mace Windu, Darth Sidious, and finally Darth Vader - all major disappointments."
4/5... best of prequel triology
Best Star Wars movie!
"The best of the prequel trilogy by far. However, it is still cheesy at times. I feel this is okay, because what Star Wars movie isn't, and because it can be looked past if someone knows it coming."
best of the prequels
One of the best Star Wars Movies I have ever seen.
"The best in the trilogy with some great lightsaber duels, unfortunately this one still feels a little flat"
"Everythings was absolutely superb - cinematography, lighting and sound were all the best. The plot was fantastic and provided a wonderful climax to the prequels."
"The story of Palpatine becoming Emperor and the formation of the Empire, the Fall of the Jedi, and the rise of Darth Vader.  It answers many of the questions that the original trilogy created!"
Best one in Star Wars history
Best star wars movie!!!
One of the best star wars films
"Cheesy love story built in but a fantastic look into Anikan and his frustrations. However, potentially the worst 10 seconds in any movie ever to close the trilogy."
"The only prequel I can tolerate, but its actually pretty good too. Better than anything Disney is trying to do with star wars."
"Overall, the best movie in the prequel trilogy. An amazing movie for the Star Wars franchise that manages to rise above the other two prequels. The story is very rich, and it sets the stage for A New Hope (technically Rogue One)."
"Best movie of the saga! Action all the way. We can really see why Anakin went to the dark side, and it is thrilling. Palpatine the best villain of all time."
I can describe this movie with a single word flawless
"The dialogue is painfully bad at times, but this is a kinetic, fast-paced, and gleefully bombastic space adventure with some genuinely dark scenes."
"I don't know how that's possible, but after two terrible prequels, George Lucas delivered the franchise's best film since episode five. Graphics have reached a level where you stop being distracted by it, editors have gone into a break with the effects of PowerPoint on a large scale, the intensity of passions does not let go until the very end, and Hayden Christensen suddenly learned to act. Revealed chic secondary characters, enough attention was paid to the most interesting antagonist of the franchise Darth Sidious, the choreography of battle scenes has become even more spectacular. I don't think we deserved such a good movie, especially from old Lucas."
It's the epic climax of the saga that complete star wars in the best trilogy ending possible.
Best of the Prequels! only Empire from Original does better!
This was definitely the best of the prequel trilogy despite the corny Nooooooooooo at the end.
"What many people consider to be the best of the prequel trilogy, this conclusion shows us the great action once again with surprisingly good acting from Hayden Christensen, Ewan Mcgregor and Ian McDiarmid as well as memorable fight sequences from the beginning battle on Coruscant to the final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin on Mustafar. Defiantly the best out of the prequel trilogy~"
"the best part of the whole series, if you don't think so you ain't a star wars fan"
"The best movie in the entire Star Wars universe. Hands down. If you don't like this movie, you probably just don't like George Lucas/Star Wars"
"Could be good story. Too much poor animations, influence to everything, wont fit to atmosphere. Settings are unconvicing. Characters... coughing droid.."
"THE TRULY BEST EPISODE OF THE STAR WARS SAGA. Majestic, epic, tragic, poetic, romantic, sad, POWEFULL."
one of the best star wars movies and the most underrated
"There is nothing about this movie not to love!  The story, the acting, the soundtrack!  It's all wonderful!  Bunch that in with the tie in novelsy (EU novels of course) and it's an unmatched experience as the rest of the true Star Wars saga (1-6) is :)

Nothing short of a full recommendation from me!"
"The dialogue could use some touching up, but the plot and acting are fantastic. An absolute must see"
"Great movie, definitely the best one out of the prequels in my opinion. The movie has a good pace and the visuals are spectacular. All the actors and actresses are great in this film, I personally loved this movie"
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?
Absolutely stunning. A truly emotional end to the prequel trilogy and possibly the perfect movie.
Best episode of  the prélogy
Best Star Wars Episode
My favourite film of the prequels. It's full of the best lightsaber battles and emotion to the transformation of lord vader. Astonishingly good
fantastic. if you love star wars you will enjoy this.
"Best movie from the prequel, a great climax and the greatest soundtrack that John Williams could have made"
Revenge of the sith brings fresh elements to the Star Wars mythology that had not been nor in the others prequels or the original trilogy. Also it feels satisfactorily connected to them.
Great elements but Hayden Christianson. Nuff said.
"This movie gives me mixed feelings. First getting into the positive things and elements that keep bringing me back to this movie; The opening scene immediately draws you in with action and suspense that the other two prequel installments failed to do. The acting performances are immediately a step up from the previous two movies, but still are sometimes stiff. The light saber duels and choreography are really fun to watch and pull you in. This movie however, is brought down by its blatant flaws. The romance between Anakin and Padme is stiff and flat out cringe. The way that the plot moves feels out of nowhere and rushed. This is by far the best prequel but still has its flaws that bring it down from the Star Wars name."
"Has some cool moments, but is still really a pile of Sith."
Top 3-4 in the saga!! The best lightsaber duel
"I love this, it's my all time favorite Star Wars movie. It doesn't have this political discussions and the edgy love story like in the 2 before. Last but not least, the transformation from Anakin into Vader was just sad and epic."
"Star Wars Episode III is one of the best films of the prequel trilogy. I am so happy that George Lucas had done something right with this film. I love the actions sequences, the key dialogue like the Opera House scene, and the dark tone of what would eventually be the rise of the Galactic Empire. Although there are some missteps like some parts of the screenplay and Hayden Christensen's overacted performance. Overall, Star Wars III finally put the previous prequel films in shame."
"Best star wars movie! Extremely thrilling, action-packed & nostalgic! A must for every star wars fan"
This is my favorite Star Wars movie ever!
Obi wan Kenobi plz respond to my DMs
"An ok ending to a mediocre trilogy. Great visuals, some thoughtful moments, lots of plot holes, and a wonderful score."
"I loved this movie, I thought it explains things well."
The conflict between Anakin and Obi-wan is one that can't be missed.
Best of the whole franchise... the high ground of film
Iconic. Some of Star Wars' best mixed with it's worst.
My favorite prequel
"Fantastic, tragic ending to the prequel trilogy."
"As  The conclusion of the biggest WAR in the Star Wars series; it mirrors other historical moments; the Fall of the Roman Republic through Ronald Syme's point of view.  So yeah I'm a snob and I think this was the best of all 9 Star Wars movies. For one, its ALL ACTION.  The amount of Star Warfare is mindboggling.  The best lightsaber duels are in this one. Yoda vs Palpatine for crissakes.   The effects were amazing.   Capital Ship to Capital Ship broadsides.  Star Fighters and Capital ships. 
    The story of the fall of a Republic, through victorious War, is soooo common in human history. Napoleon and Augustus are the most famous; It could have happened in USA so many times, but an army indoctrinated in freedom, who always held elections in wartime even under the most cataclysmic eras, is doubtful to follow orders on the suspension of elections."
4 stars just for the last 3 mins of the movie
My favorite Star Wars film
Best movie in the skywalker saga. Perfect ending to the trilogy. 1-6 and rogue one were good movies.
"Its not the best Star wars movie, but I liked it."
One of the Best Star Wars movies in entire franchise definitely. I can watch it several times and never get bored.
Revenge of the Sith is a classic! This movie is definitely worth the watch.
a bit to much emo in the end with the death of padme and the switch of anakin could have been done better. Loved the creation of VADER
Such an amazing and emotionally thrilling film. I felt the actors did a brilliant job in portraying their given characters and overall I believe this is one of the best Star Wars films ever!
Best Star Wars movie made.
A great revival from the last 2 prequels. The pacing is steady and very engaging.
Best Star Wars movie
Not that good but would watch it again in the background.
Best movie of the prequels. Ewan McGregor as Obi wan is fantastic.
Best star wars movie!
Just the best Star Wars film oat innit
favourite star wars movie of all time. period.
"This is not one of the Originals, but it is a great film. While it certainly lacks in some aspects, the action and story of Anakin's fall is an engaging and tumultuous one. The fight scenes are superb, best in the franchise, and the tensions ring high even when you know the outcome due to the Originals. A must-see for Star Wars fans."
"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will"
"I grew up with the prequels so this film is an absolute favorite of mine. The continuously battles and intense moments of the movie keeps your eyes glued to the screen at all times. The transforming of Anakin Skywalker turning into Darth Vader shows why he turned to the dark side and at moments you have empathy for him. Emperor Palpatine is the manipulator mastermind and you can feel it. The plot of the film is always at a turning point and while most know the ending, it is still stunning to see on screen. General Grievous is one of the coolest Star Wars characters of all time and his battles with Obi-Wan were great to see. The ending is emotional, intense, and makes you want to be in the Star Wars Universe."
"Growing up with the original trilogy, and watching this trilogy was a resounding disappointment. This was the beginning of the downfall of Lucas. The special effects looked bubbly and cartoonish. It completely lacked the feel of the original movies. The vehicles looked more advanced/elegant that the original movies, and that doesn't make any sense because they were prequels. The acting was some of the worst I'd ever seen in a major motion picture. Surely technology advanced. The one saving grace for this trilogy was the incredible acting for the famous character Obi-Wan. Sam Neeson was incredible throughout.

The last of the trilogy was the best by far, and this is in no small part to two things; Jar Jar Binks saw less screen time, and the film started to feel dark and gritty around the edges - finally."
One of my favourites
Though it isn't the best of them. It is definitely the most fun watching.
A great ending to the prequels
The BEST...Simply a masterpiece in the 2000s era
Epic final for the prequels
Best Star Wars movie ever created.
My favourite movie of all time
Best Star Wars Movie Ever
"One of the best Star Wars films. My favorite one. Seeing Anakin be persuaded by the Dark Side was well done. Order 66 was an emotional scene. From the get go we knew the Jedi would lose, but they way they should was still shocking and gut griping. The fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan was devastating and emotional."
"One of my favourite Star Wars movies. A fine conclusion to the prequel trilogy, that its share of good & bad moments up to this point. Great cinematography, great action, emotional plot. Thank you George for finishing the new trilogy on a high note."
"realy good, it was super fun"
"Well, finally, a good game of actors ...... A game of actors?"
"Easily the best movie in the Saga. Anakin's fall is tragic and makes you want to cry. The dynamic between Anakin and Obi wan is amazing and heartbreaking to see them fall apart in the end. By far the best lightsaber duel in the entire saga. The music, again, is the best in the saga and very memorable."
this is by far the 2nd best movie in the trilogy...7 light saber battles. What is not to like.
So good!!! Hayden Christiansen 🥰
"While some may be dissatisfied, this movie provides emotional, action-packed sequences that are unforgettable and make the rise of Darth Vader live up to what it deserves to be. While sad and devastating, it is one of the highlights of my childhood."
The best that Star Wars has to offer!
A Well written and directed prequel! A few things could of been better but overall just a great movie
Best movie of all time.
"Best prequel, the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is amazing"
I think this is the best movie of the trilogy and the end lightsaber fight was incredible
This is my personal least favorite star wars movie because of its horrible explanations for just about everything except the emperor resulting in plot holes in the original trilogy that didn't even used to exist
"This movie ROCKS. Anakin becomes the evil Darth Vader. I don't even need to say anymore. As good as the original, in my opinion."
Perfection. Wouldnt change a thing.
Best of the prequels
Great movie with a lot of action. Its a very dark and emotional movie. The lightsaber battles are great. I love everything about this movie and its my favorite Star Wars movie.
Loved almost all of it.
"Anakin vs. Obi Wan, Order 66, That opening... Do I need to say anyting else?"
"Frequently called the best of the prequels, it earns that title gracefully.
Here, George Lucas has finally decided to put some effort into his direction. And the results are powerful. While Attack of the Clones forced you to focus on it's poor writing, Revenge of the Sith's utterly gorgeous visuals distract from any nagging logical questions.

Anakin vs Obi-Wan. The birth of Darth Vader, Luke and Leia. The death of the Republic, the rise of The Empire. All these moments happen so fast and in sequence... and yet they still resonate powerfully. 

George still obviously has trouble directing actors, but the level of talent on display here is impressive. Hayden Christianson unfairly was criticized for his performance, but time has validated him- and this film."
My favorite Star Wars film.
"Great opening, great finale, the middle varies in quality but the when action, score and special effects all come together the film becomes one of the greatest sci fi movies of all time"
"I liked the third act, that's it. There are many boss battles, it feels like a video game going from battle to battle."
It my most favorite movie ever made and I love it especially the opening fight scene and the battle of mustafar
Perfect ending to the Star Wars Saga.
"Probably viewed as the best movie out of the prequel saga, and personally my second favorite out of the prequels and original trilogy. Dark, lots of action, and a good conclusion to the prequels."
"Revenge of the Sith was a really good movie. A dark plot, Obi-Wan's famous line, and a great story that concludes the Prequel Trilogy."
"A masterpiece. This movie is definitely the strongest instalment of the entire Star Wars saga. It ties every movie so stunningly with a completely hole-less plot. The emotion brought in during the mustafar duel makes for a beautiful ending, and in my opinion, is the best Star Wars duel. It truly shows what two jedi in their peak look like when fighting for their life."
"It was as one of the best prequel movies, showing Anakin's shift to become Vader and it portrayed well how quickly the Galactic Empire rise to power. It ties the prequels right into the original trilogy and later into Rogue One and Solo. It showed the emotional struggle of Anakin as he was pulled to the dark under the influence of Darth Sidious (Sheev Plapatine.) The movie also showed the conclusion of the Clone Wars and the corruption and imbalance of the Jedi. It featured some very emotional and deep scenes as well as amazing lightsaber duels. The movie had a beautiful opening scene that instantly immerses you into the initial space battle over Coruscant. It is one of my all time favorites."
This film always gets me emotional. It gets too much hate but this film is beautifully done.
Probably an unpopular opinion but Revenge of the Sith is in my top 3 favorite movies from the Star Wars saga.
Best installment of the best Star Wars trilogy.
The best of the prequels.
"The best of the prequel films. It's pacing is very fast, considering where we start of and where we finish after two hours. The film demonstrates why we should have really gotten more of this, particularly the character interactions between Anakin and Obi-Wan throughout the previous two installments that would have made for a far better storytelling experience. But as it stands, this film manages to tie together the prequel and original trilogies in a neat bow."
Grew up with it. I love it
"Brilliant end to the trilogy. Dialogue can be rough at times, although the emotional weight carries the movie throughout. Revenge of the sith is pure star wars from start to finish"
Best Star Wars movie ever.
Awesome story that properly transitions the golden days of the republic into the Evil Galactic Empire.
My favorite of the entire saga!
The best prequel. A great ending to Anakins story.
"Poor acting, terrible dialogue. Why did they decide politics was the missing part to the saga. George Lucas can't do this shit by himself, he needs to be pulled up and told he's wrong. And why was their a chain of people from the emperor to stupid robot worms trying to kill padme"
"Impressive the best movie in the Star wars saga, and the best for me in the history of cinema."
"The best movie in the saga, no comparison!"
"Mi película favorita de todas (solo por un poco por encima del episodio 5), desde el día de su estreno no he podido dejar de verla"
"I loved this film, laser fights were fantastic!"
Clearly the best film of the Prequel trilogy. I enjoyed most all the interactions between Anakin and Palpatine.
"Apart from some non sense dialog and screenplay, This movie is jam packed with action and emotion. It made me cheer, cry, and laugh. Overall dark and a good lead up to a New Hope."
Revenge Of The Sith is very good it is the best in the prequels. And that last lightsaber fight is probably the best in the saga
Can we please get more Anakin and Obi-wan?
"The best of the prequel trilogy. If that is saying much. This movie had a huge potential and it almost fulfills it with finesse and perfection. The visual effect are stunning again, that lightsaber battle is still the best we've seen on the big screen, but this time it is combined with a broodingly epic atmosphere of impending doom leading to a satisfying end.
 
It has an issue with overexplanation and shows us some things that I firmly believe we did not need to see. But Lucas closed it off nicely enough. Overall a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise."
"The most underated Star Wars movie ! top 3 star wars movie, no doubts"
Лучшая часть киновселенной!
"When I first watched, and over viewing it again, I think the same thing: this movie excites me, it gets me caring about what happens (even though, even in the first watch, I pretty much knew what would happen). For me, that's very rare in a movie that isn't drama. I usually don't expect much from sci-fi magic movies, it's not really my thing, but after this movie I went and learnt more about Star Wars, which I wouldn't probably have done without this movie and how it made me care, in this genre which isn't usually my thing. I don't think it adds much to the original trilogy, or to the two previous movies, I think it's a movie you can watch on its own."
"This is my fourth favorite Star Wars film, being Empire, Force Awakens, and Return of the Jedi. 

Unlike Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, most of the effects in this film still hold up, which is saying something for a 15-year-old movie. 

There are many elements in this film that make it one of the better Star Wars films despite some bad dialogue. All of the duels in this film are amazing, the battle scene that starts the film is one of the best ways any Star Wars film opens, Ewan McGregor nails the role of Obi-Wan, and it does a good job of wrapping up the trilogy and showing how Anakin became Vader.

My Review: B+"
Continues to get better over time. Belongs in everybody's top half of star wars films.
Some dialogue could be fixed but a great end the the prequel trilogy. Iconic moments in this movie.
"A unique movie that creates a classic tragedy within itself. Dialogue in the movie could've been better. The movie is dark compared to any other Star Wars movies, the more you analyze the movie the more dark you realize it is. A dark premise is what was expected as we knew George Lucas was making these prequels to explain the story of how Darth Vader came to be."
4th revenge of the sith 3rd best a new hope 2nd return of the jedi 1st the empire strikes back
Definitely best of the prequel trilogy.
Precuels Best! Anakin vs ObiWan
Star Wars Revenge Of The Sith was an fun epic trilogy to the skywalker saga. Get your tissues ready.
"I loved this movie, it was by far the darkest Star Wars movie"
"The relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the crown jewel of this film. A tragic story, we all already know how it ends, and yet still very moving performances. 

Some over the top moments that come off as cheesy, but still gotta give it a high score. Visually beautiful. Though these first 3 are quite complicated plats, this one is the simplest excellent telling of the fall of Anakin Skywalker. 

Also, in comparison to episodes 7-9, this along with episode I, are way under appreciated. Episode II is still kinda horrible with bad villains and terrible dialogue."
"Ok, George Lucas finally got over the hump with this one. Much better than Episodes 1 and 2. I still hate Anakin but I appreciate the clone wars TV show showing us what he could have been like so I'll get over it. Lightsaber scenes are by far the best part. Better CGI but still has a long way to go."
"Darth Vader was a bad ass, this makes him seem like an Emo kid."
the second best star wars movie
Second best star wars movies ever.
absolutely bloody amazing
"I think this is the best movie of George Lucas's newer trilogy.  I find the transformation of Anakin Skywalker to the evil and infamous Darth Vader to be remarkable.  The scene where he loses his legs and burns up from lava is the most poignant moment of the whole movie.  I enjoyed the Hayden Christensen's performance as the brooding Jedi gone Sith.  Ewan McGregor was a perfect choice to play the young Obi Wan.  I can't help but feel that Natalie Portman was an annoying light weight in this, and that Samuel Jackson was so out of place that it was absurd.  The character of Yoda could have been done much better.  The production of Yoda frankly just stunk compared to the puppetry of the character in Lucas's first series.  It could have brought this movie to a new level if that character had been produced better.  One might say that this was all overly computerized.  Stylistically, I think it could have been a great deal better to blend the style of the original classic films with these new ones so that the six movies flow more believably together.   This is the only one of the three George Lucas new trilogy movies that I'll watch.  I just purchased this on iTunes for $9.99.  A bargain IMO.  I'm glad to have it in my collection and I'm sure that I'll revisit it again some day.  Not a perfect masterpiece, but it does justice to the story of Luke Skywalker's father turned to the dark side."
the best of the saga
"This depiction almost destroys an otherwise perfectly fine storyline. If mediocrity was the goal, it is a shining follow-up to the horrible ""Phantom Menace"". I have no idea where most of the critics' heads were at when they gave these two movies higher marks than ""Attack of the Clones"", but I can guess. There are some great effects and scenery in all three prequels, but the acting, dialogue, and worse yet, delivery of the dialogue in the prequels gags me. They would be just GREAT if they'd been made in the 1950's, because that's what they sound like. But the absolute WORST thing about this movie is the burning ""birth"" of Darth Vader. The fight scene over the lava looks like it came from an early '70's made-for-TV movie, or worse, a mid-1990's SCI-FI Channel movie - almost as if the effects budget ran out just in time for the climactic scene. Really, I might have to go back and watch it again to see if I was seeing what I think I saw; maybe it will earn another half a star!"
All three of these new prequels sucked.  What a disappointment.
Definetly my favorite Star Wars movie
From the prequels this is the best
"The most powerful, most emotional, and the better written film in the prequel trilogy. ROTS dives more into the turn of Anakin Skywalker from good to bad. There is less of the cringe dialogue between Anakin and Padme in this than in EP II, they have more chemistry in this film. The CGI is way better than the previous two films. The beginning of the film shows a rescue mission in space and the effects looks very good in it. Hayden Christian performance is much better, there is less of the wooden acting from him, and that might have been down to George Lucas. It is the most powerful in the prequels because you've got the order 66 screen which is powerful on it's own but it has the music from John Williams which is some of his best in the Star Wars franchise, but that's not his best in the film as that belongs to the music that plays over Anakin and Obi-Wan fight at the end of the film, the choreography throughout the prequels is fantastic and it is shown in the final fight between them. It is also fantastic to watch it as a experience. The movie also goes at a quick pace throughout the film, it doesn't really slow down for much. But the only big criticism I've have on this movie is that the whole (Spoliers) Padme dying of a broken heart doesn't really have the emotional effects that Lucas wanted to show and the whole Darth Vader saying NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Isn't the best thing to hear coming from Vader."
This movie redeems the Prequel Trilogy and avoided some (not all) of the cringe-worthy aspects of the first two movies.
A great plot makes for what is easily the best prequel.
"The way George Lucas pleases the fans in this final episode of the new trilogy, is astonishing, giving them what they wanted and even more, closing characters stories, and giving us some answers that we all had before this trilogy."
"Episode III concludes the prequels well but not great, the story is good and to see a child turn into such an infamous villain is great to watch and is heart-wrenching. What this movie suffers is more with the directing and the monotone pieces of the script, Ewan saves this movie but there are still weekpoints. Overall love it alot"
The Fall of Anakin is amazing. The deeper you look the better it gets.
It has not aged well like The Phantom Menace in my opinion. Although the movie does a masterful job on playing on character emotions and the last 3rd of the film is done perfectly.
A relatively satisfying cap to the prequel saga with good character moments and set pieces.
Great film. Dark and well written. Couple of flaws but mostly perfect. Must watch Star Wars film.
"Movie got too much hate when it first came out, but turned into an all time classic. One of the best star wars movies ever made. Perfectly balanced with emotion and grit, with the prequel duels."
Way better then any disney one
Top 3 Star Wars films ever released! And this is by far the best prequel
"The origin story of Darth Vader and prequel to the 1977 Star Wars film, A New Hope!"
As the final piece of the Skywalker saga for all time to come George did a near perfect job of rounding out the story and does so in his signature style.
This movie was by far the best from the prequel trilogy. There were still some flaws but this movie was the reason why we watched the prequels to begin with. Better CGI and this movie were really dark at the end. It had a good introduction to cinema's most loved space villains. There are things that don't make sense in this film but at least it well in the end.
"More like Revenge of the Sh*t. Episode III still features terrible dialogue and terrible acting from Christensen. Out of the three it’s the least painful to watch but that’s not saying much considering how awful Episode II was, and how terrible Episode I was."
By default the best of the prequels.
"Much better than I remember it being! The film does a good job of why people were so willing to ditch the Jedi and Republic in favor of the Empire. The Jedi really did everything the Palpatine accused them of including trying to overthrow him and take over the Senate. Still suffers from a lot Prequel/Lucas-isms including a plot that centers around politics and clunky dialogue. I also refuse to believe that Anakin is a tragic hero. Independent of prior knowledge, it's clear that he's turning evil the entire movie. He wears black leather (in contrast to brown cloth), has a menacing scar and consistently shows that he is arrogant and hateful."
A good Star Wars movie.
One of the greatest movies ever made!
"Easily the best of the prequels. There are still issues, like how quickly the turn for Anakin was, the way Padme dies, and some of the acting. But there are some great special effects and action sequences here. The final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is arguably the best in series history. A very enjoyable entry."
"My all-time favourite Star Wars movie, and indeed my favourite movie of all time!  A perfectly plotted and executed end of the prequel trilogy and set up for the original trilogy, this is THE movie Star Wars fans waited for for almost 30 years!  It is easily THE most thrilling and exhilarating Star Wars movie, becoming a non-stop thrill ride for most of its running time.  It features THE two greatest lightsaber duels of all time (Palpatine-Yoda and Anakin-Obi-Wan).  The special effects were the greatest at that point in time (and in many ways still rival those of the sequel trilogy & Anthology).  Cast is great, with Ian McDiarmid in particular providing his best performance yet.  Also easily the darkest Star Wars, yet benefits immensely from it."
REALLY picks up the threads left dangling by the other two. Excellent all around.
"The final installment of the prequel trilogy is the best film among the three- which isn't saying much at all. Revenge of the Sith is a dark movie and even its few lighthearted moments come under a cloud of grim expectations. Although Revenge of the Sith is the third volume of the prequel trilogy, its quality places it alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars has to offer. Its flaws are easily forgiven; it offers the same successful blend of high energy sci-fi melodrama, epic tragedy, and satisfying storytelling provided by Episodes IV and V. In many ways, Revenge of the Sith is the most important chapter of the first six episodes and, until its release, the Star Wars saga remained incomplete. Revenge of the Sith exists not only as a fine chapter in its own right but its existence improves the other five segments, adding context and depth not only to the two other prequels but to all three members of the original trilogy."
"Finally, they're getting better."
"I think the movie is almost entirely held up by the end, as the end has great soundtrack, fights, and dialogue. A great movie for the prequels."
"Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Star Wars prequels, mainly because the plot gets to the good stuff, with Palpatine finally making his grab for power and the rise of Darth Vader. Sadly, Anakin's turn to the Dark Side and the reveal of the Emperor's true face are fumbled badly, in scenes more likely to illicit giggles than gasps. There's no question that Lucas is a visionary, it's just a shame he didn't see fit to collaborate with other scriptwriters and directors, as this could all have been so much better."
Some underwhelming parts but an overall fitting end
"For sure the best movie of the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith shows us the birth of the greatest villain in cinema, with an outstanding performance of all actors, incredible."
"Best Star Wars, best film"
"Quite good, better that the previous two prequels and worth of the original Trilogy."
"It has its flaws. However, there are many redeeming qualities. The story of Emperor Palpatine's rise to power is one of the best story lines to come out of the prequels and to see its climax is quite something. The choreography is near flawless, using real guards and techniques a proper swordsman would use which adds another layer of depth to each fight scene. I would highly recommend this to any and all star wars fans, becoming a must see for those who have watched the clone wars cartoons as it adds even more depth to each character and story arc."
81% || The best of the prequel trillogy. Perfectly ending off Anakin's origin.
O melhor de todos comparado com ação!
"Revenge of the Sith is certainly a flawed movie, but I defy any Star Wars fan not to enjoy it.

In spite of the gratuitious use of CGI, the storyline of Obi-Wan, Anakin, Padme, and Palpatine is actually an incredibly interesting tale. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are absolutely peerless in their embodiment of their characters: the noble Obi-Wan and the sinister Palpatine.

Hayden Christensen, while given some scenes of atrocious dialogue, actually does Anakin justice in several notable scenes. The stoic fear he displays in the scene where he discusses his nightmares with Padme. His anger and frustration when being given a secret spy mission from Obi-Wan. He massively improved from his performance in Attack of the Clones.

The final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the most emotionally charged in the franchise's history. While Luke and Vader were father and son, the two hardly knew each other. Anakin and Obi-Wan grew up together and have saved each other's lives countless times. The fight choreography is the best in the series, as well, by far."
"Finally, out of the prequel series, this is one that I can recommend. It hints at being corny, but I think the overall mood of the series which led up to episode IV brings it to a satisfied conclusion. Some things were high in regard to the storyline. But still, we get this sense of humor that's not needed. Winks and nods to characters in the story seem reliable and it ends in a bad note, but it needed it. It is worthwhile. Still get a kick out of it. I recommend you see it."
"for me personaly, i think this is the best star wars movie there is.
i loved it the first time i saw it and i still do!
i remember when it came to cinema and the hype serounding it. it was a great time!"
"really good movie, still gets the prequel hate.
Well these people should start watch the sequels and rate them to get to know what is a bad star wars movie"
"A great finale to its respective trilogy, ""Revenge of the Sith"" has a much darker tone with many thrills and emotions in a movie filled with so much great action and much better acting with a more developed plot, 9/10."
"By all the Prequels, Revenge of the Sith aged the best and is arguably the best of the Prequels"
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was amazing. I love it.
My opinion of this film is it is the greatest thing to ever happen to star wars. I love this movie wholeheartedly and believe this film is a must see for anyone.
"Revenge of the sith is an emotionally rich, epic action packed film and necessary addition to the star wars saga, and the savior of the prequels"
Best movie in the franchise for me.
very good. The connection and love shown from Ewan Mcgregor (as Obi-Wan) towards Anakin is sublime. A must-see for any star wars fanatic
This is where the fun begins
Best star wars movie ever
Save yourself some time and skip to the last hour. The birth of Darth Vader did not need to be stretched out over 3 bad movies.
Actually kind of enjoyed this film
amazing so much to love the not just the best prequel its the best star wars movie so much to love it has ever thing action Darth Vader emperor Plapitine and so much much more.
"Nice ending to the Anakin trilogy, bittersweet and good fights. It shows how an heroic and compassionate religion can work for and help create a great evil."
Too much walking and talking
"I loved the stunts. By far some of the best fighting, and the soundtrack was amazing too. I wish we'd go back to this style instead of what we got."
"I love this movie but like every other film it has some minor bad parts, but overall it is enjoyable to watch."
"The climax of the prequel trilogy, Star Wars Revenge of the Sith brings balance to the force by closing all loose ends between the two trilogies, portraying Anakin's fall to the Dark Side and the rise of Darth Vader. A satisfying conclusion, ROTS has four of the best duels in the saga, with expert swordmsanship from Ewan Mcgregor and Hayden Christensen. It also introduces fan favourites to the saga such as General Grievous, a four-armed cyborg with asthma, and clones such as Commander Cody, who were destined to become iconic through the Clone Wars television series. Despite some incredible special effects for its time, the movie suffers from poor scripts and dialogue, resulting in lines such as ""From my point of view the Jedi are evil"", and ""You're shorter than I expected"". John Williams delivered an impeccable score however, superbly supporting scenes such as Order 66 with themes of tragedy and sadness. George Lucas's final Star Wars film provided the emotional height of the saga, the tragic betrayal of the Jedi setting up the original trilogy's feeling of hope and desperation well."
amazing dont listen to the haters
As much as I'd hate to say it it's my favorite Star Wars movie. Although far from perfect it has a certain charm to it with very fun and exciting action scenes. I just love this mo
"Great story, plot, and effects. 
Unfortunately, some of the execution is just not there. Scenes that should have had some better progression (ie: Anakins decent to madness) were rushed. It lacked some depth with showing the other members of the council being taken down by storm troopers and missed a huge opportunity for an action sequence. Nonetheless, it tied up the prequel trilogy nice in terms of storyline."
The movie is full of memes. Enough said. All is the best of Prequels
Revenge of the Sith deserves more credit than it gets. It's always been my favorite of the prequel trilogy and in my opinion has the best choreography and scoring in the series
"Really a well made film. Best prequel by far. Excellent plot, action was epic, acting was good, cinematography was beautiful, and some of the best music ever. Really an Integral part of the Star Wars experience."
Literally the best Star Wars movie ever made. Also the most underrated Star Wars ever made. The reviews don't give this film enough justice. The storyline is phenomenal and Ian McDiarmid as emperor Palpatine is one of the best performances of all time.
Best Star Wars film
The final pre-queal of the Star Wars saga we've been waiting so far.
"One of the best Star Wars film to date. Amazing scenery, great story telling, and a great end to a trilogy. Couldn't be happier with the movie."
"While this movie has its very noticable flaws, the general consensus around this movie is in my opinion wrong and Revenge Of The Sith is a good way to end off the Prequel trilogy."
I wish they had left the original trilogy alone! I appreciate that these three films were planned to come out first but really?!? I thought the effects of the original films were actually more realistic. I thought Ewan McGregor was the poorest choice for Obi Wan. But who could replace Alec Guinness? This truly was an awful film.
"The best film of the prequels.  This film has great special effects and story writing.  It feels a little convoluted at times, but in essence, it IS a Star Wars film in feel and in name."
"If someone wants to see a Star Wars movie even after watching all of them, I would recommend this. It has everything a Star Wars fan would want. The Clone Wars, the Jedi, the sith, the Republic, the Empire, Dooku, Palpatine, Vader, Luke, Leia, the Millennium Falcon, Grievous, Jar Jar, amazing lightsaber battles, and amazing CGI."
"A lot of people say Revenge Of The Sith is the best of the Prequel Trilogy, and I agree it is indeed. The visuals, even the performances of the cast has greatly improved thanks to the much needed improvement from George Lucas' writing and direction. But honestly, I still prefer The Phantom Menace at the end of the day."
"The perfect end to the prequel trilogy. Brilliant actions scenes creating some classic Star Wars moments. The iconic rise of Vader being one such moment. Well acted by McGregor, Portman and Mcdiarmid who move the film brilliantly"
"Best of the prequels. An enjoyable watch with lots of action and one of the best lines in the Star Wars Saga - ""I have the high ground""."
"Often eschewing logic and having a central couple with zero chemistry sinks this love story, but at its core Revenge of the Sith is an interesting tragedy that manages to tie up the prequels satisfyingly while setting up the events of A New Hope boosted by a strong performance from Ewan McGregor, and one of the best (and longest) lightsaber duels of the whole saga."
This is where the fun begins!
Very dark like it should be the best movie from the prequels by far
This is a great movie. In my opinion this is the best star wars movie ever made. Yes this movie does have some flaws but everything else in the movie throws those flaws out the window. The cast are so much better in this movie the best being Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi
"By far the best of the Prequel Trilogy. Wraps up the 6 part saga beautifully. Beautifully shot and the score, Fantastic. John Williams at his best. Ian McDiarmid is brilliant as the Emporer."
Best Star Wars movie made....
Personally I love this movie. Very surprised to see such a low audience rating. Sad actually. Yoda vs Sidious and Vader vs Obi wan are classic scenes that will live forever in movie folklore.
"The one prequel worth watching. The digital filmmaking techniques Lucas has been developing for years finally payed off, and the more dramatic story naturally paved the way for much more interesting and polished art direction (especially considering this is a space epic). Many problems of the other prequels are still there, especially cause they mostly have to do with world and character building, but there are also a number of memorable epic scenes and the story is very focused(presumably cause we already know the ending) and actually meaningful politics this time. The darkness also brings an interesting flavor of Star Wars hinted at in The Empire Strikes Back. You'll have a good time if you don't think too much about how it connects to the original trilogy(the answer is surprisingly too well)."
Best start wars movie. Epic wars in the stars
The best Star Wars film
Better than all of the new ones!
"space battles were epic, fight scenes were epic, very emotinal, overall just one of the best movies of all time"
"My personal favorite star wars film, BUT not the best. It would be if what it tried to be came to fruition 100% of the time."
"After 3 attemps, they finally got it right. This is what the Prequel Trilogy should have been from the very start. Sure, the effects and acting woes are still there, but the story and pacing are a vast improvement. This movie hooks you from beginning to end, and is worthy of its Star Wars name."
Best Ever. Best opening of any movie and galaxy shattering ending cannot be replicated ever again
Im giving this 5 stars 1.because im a man of culture.  2. Because obi wan indeed did have the high ground.
This movie was a masterpiece of Scifi. The ending  will blow you away and the tension it builds is incredible.
From the get go you can tell this is the story Lucas was trying to tell in the prequels.
best memes ever r/PrequelMemes
Jesus saw this movie and was inspired to create the galaxy.
I think George needed more than 3 movies to really do Anakin's journey to the dark side some justice. Some of it seemed rushed and out of place.
"Loved this flim, I used to like it more than a new hope, this flim had a great ending to, would have been better had lucas kept the scene were yoda lands on dagoba where luke meets up with him 20 years later but lucas always wanted yoda to be a mystery, so I'll give that a pass. My main problem with this flim is how anakin assume padme and obi wan were in cahoots that made zero sense to me."
The best film in the star wars saga
the best star wars movie!!!
"Revenge of the Sith is an entertaining and thrilling end to the Star Wars prequel trilogy, even if the plot is still rushed and a bit uneven."
A fun interesting ride with a lot of action
I thought it was a good movie with some great battles in it and some relatively good CGI.
Revenge Of The Sith. Is my favorite film of all time with The Empires Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. It really came full circle for me.
One of the best movies ever made
The added reviews in the past couple years make this out to be better than it really is. It was and will always be a 69%. It’s definitely not a B-.
"Masterpiece of a movie, tied together the superb Star Wars plot and saga engineered by George Lucas, special effects stunning, plot emotional and exciting and one of the most memorable movies you'll ever watch."
This is the stars wars movie.
"This is among the best Star Wars Movies ever made, Don't let the first two mediocre movies from the prequel trilogy fool you.  This movie was a masterpiece."
"Overrated. Yes, it is better than the other prequels but not by that much. The acting is still terrible, the writing is even worse, the story is not only predictable but extremely lazy and the cgi looks like a video game. It's not terrible but not good either. Meh is about right."
The Best Prequel-Movie!
The best of the prequels...
My personal favorite in the star wars saga. This movie starts off with a terrific opening scene and has the best action out of all the movies in the saga.
best star wars movie.
Galaxy shattering movie that for ever destroyed republic and Jedi order.
"With Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas brings his second Star Wars trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant -- if still a bit uneven -- conclusion."
It has some of the best star wars scenes of all time like order 66 and Anakin vs Obi Wan. But for it still has the same terrible writing and storytelling that we saw in the first 2 prequels. This isn't an amazing movie but it is a very rewatchable movie that gets more praise than it exactly deserves.
"Some many good scenes, so a powerful story."
Best SW by far. This is SW trikogy that really worth something telling story of falling civilization and not OT. OT don't even have depth
"How to redeem a saga! This is a great Star Wars movie, far better than Attack of the Clones and the Phantom Menace. There are some many cool fight scenes I need a page to write them down. Hayden Christensen is much better here than Attack, through hes still far behind other actors like Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson. Apart from the whole Padme thing, a great movie even if it is a little tiring."
Nothing more can be said except Best SW in history and non will ever reach its heights
Excellent conclusion of one of greatest trilogies of all time
For me story end with this. Im not interesed in obsolete trilogy not in defeat of Sith. Republic has fallen and empire was raised. No more Jedi and small rebellion are not of interest to me.
It's an improvement in this chaotic unnecessary trilogy.
Amazing!! The battles and the entire soundtrack are one of the best things of the movie.
The best one and that's obvious
"Easily the best of the prequels, but by no means a masterpiece. I like the opening space battle, Palpatine and that's about it. 4/10."
It's so fantastic this is the only movie of the prequel saga that reminds me of the old Star Wars movies and the Darth Vader transformation was brilliant
For me this Star Wars movie is the best movie. I think every film is good but this is the best.
This is The Best out of all of the Star wars prequels. I enjoyed this movie. I watched it 300 times.
This is the best movie of the prequel trilogy telling us how anakin became Vader and also shows us how Luke got to tatooine and How Liea ended up in Aldeeran
"Though the prequel trilogy may not had started the best way, it ends on a thrilling, exciting and awesome way, with great character development, amazing visual effects and splendid battle sequences."
Both the phantom Menace and attack of the clones had the potential to be great movies. But each one had a movie-wide problem that made the movie average overall. Revenge of the sith is the result of that potential being used to it's full ability. Giving us undoubtedly the best Star Wars prequel.
I guess I liked it. This trilogy really did live up to its potential.
One of the all time greats
This movie has the high ground out of any Star Wars movie. Real emotion felt. Disney feels watered down. Like hey guys likes blow up the death star a third time! Wow that is so inventive... Also let’s have Rey never have any training just be really good with a lightsaber because girl power... Kylon ren is also a whiny schoolgirl. Gimme Darth Sidious Anyday. Infinite power!
"A perfect film, in every way. Great story, visuals, choreography, and average script."
"10/10 Best Star Wars Movie to date. CGI still holds up almost 15 years later. Great emotional beats and a perfect score, holds up nicely both as a stand-alone film and as the finale in the 6 part franchise orchestrated by George Lucas"
Amazing. A stunning piece of history
Lucas' true masterpiece. Simply breathtaking
A work of modern art
Best prequel movie forsure. A great tale of the rise of Vader and the end of the clone wars. A must watch in my opinion and much better than the films Disney has come up with.
This is where the fun begins.
The best Star Wars movie ever!
Some movies get better with time. The full range of pure emotion that this film conveys is striking.
Excellent movie. It’s easily the best movie of the prequel trilogy. This along with the prequels have only gotten better for me over the years. I love the work of George Lucas and appreciate it all the positive impact the films had on me growing up.
"It's one of my favorite Star Wars movies.

also the only Star Wars movie I can't make it through without crying, if I am lucky enough to make it through, cos Order 66 is too fucking sad

all the clones :("
Classic. Far better than the sequals.
Revenge of the Sith. It's a bold one
Incredible. Arguably the most compelling star wars yet
Never saw the twist ending coming
"Amazing.
Epic conclusion to the Prequel trilogy and holds up perfectly to this day. The duels and score are by far the best of the saga, far beyond what the newer movies and shows can match."
home of literally the best lightsaber fights in star wars it is a must-see
Classic. Slightly rushed but good overall.
Epic. It is critical we send a positive review there immideatly
Best Star Wars movie ever!
I love this movie. Not even ironically or as a meme. I just love this movie. Will watch whenever it's on. Never gets old.
"This movie beatuifully captures the internal conflict Anakin is suffering from, the rise of the Empire with the fantastic Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine capturing the role as Palpatine perfectly. Not to mention amazing special effects and John Williams best to date music."
"Revenge of the Sith was a great ending for the Prequel trilogy, perhaps the greatest there could've been. It has come to be an absolute classic, by both telling a great story and by being as Star Wars as Star Wars could be. It didn't only tie off the Prequel trilogy, it also serves as a bridge to the originals."
The greatest movie of our generation.
"Revenge of the Sith was the Chosen One! It was said to destroy the bad press of the previous movies, not join them! Bring balance to the Prequels, not leave them in darkness!... And it did!"
It's the best movie of all time.
Favorite fight scene ever
"Cant decide whether i like this better than force awakens or not, but its a great star wars movie. If lucas had made the first two prequels the way he made this one, the prequels could have been awesome movies. But, this is the only great prequel. Phantom menace is ok and attack of the clones is dogshit"
It's over Anakin I have the high ground
Best Star Wars movie! Love it!
11/10 Best star wars film don't @ me
Have you ever heard the tragedy of the ROS audience score? It’s not something the Rotten Tomatoes executives would tell you...
"Saw it when I was 15, fun movie. Would watch again."
"It was good, not as good as the originals but better than the other prequels and pretty emotional."
The only prequel in the Star Wars franchise I would recommend!
Best ending to the prequels and originals
"Star Wars revenge of the Sith successfully caps off the prequel era. It seemed like this movie did few things wrong. Anakin Skywalker was a way better protagonist in the beginning of the movie. The story was absolutely incredible and the cgi was great for its time. This film is on par with the original movies. It included an amazing scene with Palpatine explaining to Anakin about Darth Plagueis that was portrayed flawlessly! The romance was a little bit better but was still nonetheless cringeworthy. I personally think this film was underrated. My only problems were how they handled Padme at the end (a broken heart really), the fight between the Emporer and Yoda (we don't need lightsabers), General Grevious (he was portrayed as a coward), and weird dialogue. I personally thought Anakins beginning lightsaber fight scene was pretty good as it showed how powerful Anakin has become since we saw him in Attack of the Clones. It's hard for me to say a lot of negatives about this movie because there aren't many negatives. This movie successfully closes out the prequel era and transitions into the original era. In my opinion the prequels failed to capitalize on their main characters as they had so much potential to be great. I think the handling of their main characters wasn't perfect but did a lot better than the previous two movies. The Anakin and Obi Wan friendship in the beginning was a great example of that. I thought this movie successfully closed out the prequel era and I would recommend it"
"definitely the strongest of the star wars prequel trilogy, and my personal favorite. this movie truly felt like a tragedy, and you felt the emotion after order 66 and anakin's fall to the dark side. while the dialogue was still scrappy at some points, it was a true dot-connector."
"Everyone loves ROTS, and don't get me wrong I love it too, but it's still a prequel with hokey acting, dated visuals and some bland characters. McGregor, Oz, and Jackson make the prequels worth watching, and as I said before this is a good film, but to say it's the best Star Wars film is a long shot for me. The prequels took focus from the stories away in favor of world building, but this film focuses back on the story and puts things on track to stick the landing. (albeit a little bumpy) This definently has some of the best sequences and scenes in any SW film. The Mustafar fight, Order 66, General Grevious vs Obi-Wan. As I said before the visuals for this film have become SOOOO dated it's not even funny, normally I wouldn't complain, but The Lord of the Rings came out around the same time, and this is Star Wars they are known for there Visual Effects. Hayden Christiansen's acting is bad, but I blame that on Lucas' direction, and Portman clearly just isn't into it (feeling more like a daytime SOAP actor, and yeah I know Star Wars is like a soap opera, but it's also a big budget blockbuster movie, so come on.) I prefer The Original Trilogy and The Sequel Trilogy over this film, but it's well made and I still get goosebumps when I see that mask draped over Vader's face."
Revenge of the sith is the best movie in the prequel trilogy which may not be saying much but it is still fairly decent the cgi is miles better and is alot more entertaining and better as far as movie making goes but the movie still suffers from Hayden Christensens bad acting and still has terrible dialogue but is definitely an improvement from the previous two films and deserves a 7/10
SW Episode 3 is by far the best out of the entire Prequel trilogy!
"3rd (story-wise) in the Star Wars saga, it's the movie that finally connects the prequels with the old trilogy. The main enemy finally shows his true face and we finally see how the most iconic villain of the series came to existence, while seeing the downfall of the Jedis and with them the old republic. The Siths' plan and actions are smart, unforeseen and implacable. The action is still there, and the tension and emotion remain present. The dialog and romance aren't still quite at the level we could expect, but the overall scenario feels sound and on par with the rest of the saga."
A Entertaining Ride at Home.
For me story ends with ep 3. I don't care for OT or ST. Star Wars for me is fall of republic and jedi and rise of sith and empire. OT I have not watched from 2005 nor I'm planning to ever again. PT only for me
"Surprisingly, Lucas finally brings on the big screen, the explanation of the events of the original trilogy, and is explained well!"
Best Star Wars of all. Star Wars are Sith and Jedi and battle between light and dark. This is last true SW. Nothing in future will show that struggle. Especially not The Mandalorian who will be SW just in name because no wars or duels will be there.
"A dramatic emotional conclusion of the trilogy. Although badly acted in some cases and certainly unevenly paced, a fitting and thrilling story."
A great and chilling end to the trilogy.
It's in my top 5 of favorite Star Wars films. Easily the best of the prequels. McDiarmid steals the show and is phenomenal in every scene he is. Hayden is much better in this one than Episode II. Definitely the darkest Star Wars movie to date.
"An exciting, entertaining and challenging conclusion to the prequel trilogy, combined with Lucas's direction and script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Tattersall's cinematography, Burtt and Barton's editing, Bocquet's production design, Roberts and Giovanni's set decoration, Biggar's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Revenge Of The Sith is the best and most entertaining of the prequels and challenges The Empire Strikes Back for the title of darkest Star Wars story!"
The best of the saga
"Another trilogy ends; unexpectedly, it doesn't end on a whimper. ROTS solves its dialogue problem by having a great story and numerous, fantastic action sequences."
"It is considered better than first two preuql films, but come on. its build off cliches, predictble plots and twits, and awkward lines.
Not theat legendary unlike star wars glory days."
Revenge of the Sith is underated and is my third favorite Star Wars movie.
Best of the prequels! Great to see the Vader origin!
"Absolutely love it, has everything a Star Wars movie, must have, and the final showdown between Obi and Annakin are cherry pie"
"This movie is excellent, Ewan McGregor is fantastic as Obi-Wan."
No one can top this movie! This is star wars in its truest form
"If your not with me, then you're my enemy"
Its the best movie of the saga
"The best stars Wars film. This movie is almost perfect, it's pure poetry. The plot it's a tragedy. Ewan mcgregor is amazing, like in every Star Wars film, he steals the show. The cgi it's amazing, it has age well. If you only have to watch a Star Wars film for all your life, choose this one."
Don't see how this one has a higher rating than the other two. It is the most predictable and hardest to watch of the prequels. The only saving grace is Ewan McGregor
Best SW movie ever and only ep2 ending with battle on Geonisys was better
Not as bad as I once thought
Best Star Wars ever
Anakin cut hand from Windu is point of no return. His wife was more important to him than Jedi Order
"This film adds the most action of all star wars films. It's crammed with lightsaber duels, space battles and deception. The second half does a good job tying up the loose ends between the prequels and the originals."
"Now this movie is definitely one of my all time favorite Star Wars movies ever!! I'll never forget watching this movie with my dad when I was 5 year old, it was a really beautiful movie!! John Williams' scores were amazing, the CGI improved majorly, Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor's performances were amazing and the acting was some what good. The tiny flaws about this movie that I still dislike to this day are the scenes with Anakin and Padme, those scenes always bore me to death. The acting seems really lazy in those scenes and is somewhat cheesy in the one scene on Mustafar before the lightsaber duel.

Overall, this movie was an awesome closing to the prequel series. The best parts of the movie for me was Anakin and Obi-Wan in their ships in the beginning, the fight with Count Dooku, Palpatine fighting Mac Windu and the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan."
The first two episodes may not have been George's bets outing... but man did he make up for them with the final installment.
"I don't care what others say, this is a damn good movie."
The essence of Star Wars!
It is recomended for PG 10.The actors is vary very cool. He rpresents the history in a way inprecionant. And is vary dificult to represet. they can do this. Congratulations
"Visual mastery and complex story allow this movie to surpass all the other prequels, if not all the rest of the Star Wars movies."
"This is Star Wars!
Battles everywhere, lightsaber duels, Jedi has fallen into trap of Sidious and he managed to cought them by surprise destroying them.
Jedi Council was corrupt and power hungry as much as sith.
Best Star wars movie"
"Lo mejor, espectacular"
"Excellent, the best movie of the Star Wars"
"Fantastic, thrilling and visually beautiful. Star Wars episode 3 is wonderful fit to the saga. Better script and better dialogue. This film is a vast improvement of its other two predecessors, and is a MUST WATCH. Don't let the bad reviews fool you into thinking otherwise. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT."
"An amazing movie that brought a touching conclusion to the end of the prequel trilogy, and to the end of the story of Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight."
It is a very good movie it's a good way to conclude the prequels it's obviously a very underrated Star Wars movie I think anyone could like it's fun to go to action heart Etc.
"best movie of the prequels, heartbreaking, masterpiece of george lucas."
"This movie has the highground!!!

(Over the sequels especially)"
One of my all time favorites.
My favourite of them all
"Say what you will about the performances and some of the dialogue, But the Story, World-building, design, and effects are some of the best Hollywood has to offer."
"This was a great movie , people hate on it for nothing"
"An Amazing Plot, Awesome special effects for 2005. Hayden Christensen really stepped it up.... The score can leave you with goosebumps...Clone Troopers are great and General Grievous is an interesting and thrilling character. Revenge of the Sith is a thrilling film that I rank as my NO.1 Star Wars film."
"This is now the 11th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and I can gladly say that it was as good as the last time I watched it.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the 6th Star Wars film and the 3rd Star Wars prequel. The film was directed by George Lucas who also directed Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The film stars Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker and Ian McDiarmid as Sheev Palpatine.


The acting unlike the last two films was steady from the emotion to the dialogue delivery. There were a couple bad actors, but for the most part I felt that the acting was quiet good. I also thought that Hayden Christensen did quiet a good job unlike the his portrayal in the last two films.


The characters/character arcs I found my self enjoying and even liking this time around. Unlike the last two films the characters are both written and portrayed a lot better.


The film also has some strong cinematography with some very good shots of the characters and scenery.


The film also has some strong memorable settings from the planet Mustafar to General Grievous's ship.


The set designs and props are done very well from the building designs to the various weapons.


The costume design and makeup is also done very well especially with the Jedi and Sith.


The special effects improve on the last two films, but are still dated. Some of the CGI looks good with the ships and machinery, but when the CGI is a living breathing life form it always looks off.


The action also improves on the last two films especially the duels between the Jedi and Sith. Some times it's a little over the top, but that doesn't really bother me.


The music like most of John Williams work is really strong and fits the film very well.


The story is also the strongest and most enjoyable of the prequels. The story in my opinion is done very well and is one of the stronger story's from the Star Wars universe.


The comedy didn't work for me, but luckily most of it is toward the beginning.


The film toward the beginning had a okay atmosphere, but from the 2nd act onward the film had a very strong atmosphere especiallyaround the character Anakin Skywalker.

I also want to point out that in my opinion the scenes between Anakin and Palpatine are handled exetremly well.


The film is also really enjoyable and is something that I could watch again and again.

Over all I give it a
6/10
60%
3/5


""Master Skywalker there are two many of them what are we going to do?"""
"Even though Hayden Christensen is given the worst dialogue and direction possible, the rest of Revenge of the Sith actually feels like a Star Wars movie. Visual storytelling, a good mythos, and possibly the greatest lightsaber fight at the end make the film an enjoyable watch."
This and the last of the trilogy are the best
"This isn't a perfect movie, but it is pretty good. Hayden Christiansen is a terrible actor, but there's some other great scenes in this like the opera scene or the final battle, Ewan McGregor is quite good in this as well."
"Similar to the other films in this trilogy, it is messy at parts. The second half seems rushed and tries to squeeze everything in and makes you feel the past two films are useless. Simply, the thrill of seeing the younger characters from the originals participating in epic duels is unbelievable. This makes the film visually undeniably brilliant and exciting. It provides a satisfying explanation for the beginning of the original trilogy."
"This movie feels like George Lucas forgot where he was going in this trilogy in this film and in some cases it can be watched without the other two episodes in this trilogy. It seems, from a long-time viewer of this saga of films, that the first two prequels are mostly pointless in the overarching saga making this film have to pick up the pace and fill in any plot points left out to bridge the gap to A New Hope. This film is very rushed and tries to cover a lot of ground very quickly, but overall it does a pretty good job doing so. A lot of the performances are well-acted and the shots set up are mostly nice looking ecpecially for the time."
"Episode III will always hold a special place in my heart. It completed the epic six part saga George Lucas created in 1977, all while being a decent movie on its own. While many older Star Wars fans may have been disappointed in the over-usage of CGI and flashy set pieces, Episode III contains one of the best lightsaber battles in the entire saga."
The prequels are great
"This is definitely the best out of the prequel saga. They had a lot of story to cover since the first two did not cover much ground when it came to Anakin. The movie has decent pacing, decent CGI, good action, and a good amount of entertainment."
"So far (April, 2019), my favorite Star Wars movie!"
Better than I but not by much
"Best one of the prequels. some clumpsy dialogue and the worst ""Noooo"" in movie history, but still very enjoyable."
This is the a fun and cohesive way to begin one of the most beloved trilogies in the galaxy.
"The best of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith is a entirely entertaining and satisfying conclusion with lots of great action, effects and character moments. If only Hayden Was a better actor"
Probably my favorite STAR WARS movie! This is amazing!
one of the best star war films to date
"If you're just looking to set your brain aside and enjoy stylized violence with good visual effects, this is actually a pretty fine movie for that."
10/10 best sci-fi movie and best movie ever.
"La mejor pelÃ­cula de la segunda trilogÃ­a y eso es decir mucho, tiene algunas forzadas pero el aire de derrota le ayuda mucho a la historia, varias cosas pasan porque tienen que pasar para que coincida con la trilogÃ­a original"
Episode III is by far the GREATEST Star Wars film to ever be produced. The movie perfectly portrays all the characters and is by far superior to the original trilogy and the garbage disney movies that should never have been made to begin with.
"Say what ever you want about the other two Prequels, they probably deserve it, but this IS a good Star Wars movie. 
In this movie they finally got the brother relationship between Anakin and Obi-wan right. Jar Jar is not present (thank God). Yoda kicks awesome butt.  
Now there are problems though, there is still some terrible line deliveries, mostly by Hayden Christianson. 
But I still say this is a good Star Wars movie."
"With too much corny dialogue, Anakin's turn to the dark side feels silly and contrived. Too much cartoon physics, such as the lightsaber battle on lava."
"I think I like Revenge of the Sith as much as The Empire Strikes Back.  My only gripe with the movie was really Anakin's seemingly turning to the Dark side so fast.  I know it wasn't fast and he always had that darkness as a child.  It was just ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" was really when he stopped Mace from killing Palpatine by cutting his hand off, thereby inadvertently letting Palpatine kill him.  Ok, so he screwed up big time, but just turning to the Dark side because Palpatine told him, he could help Padme was just stupid.  He should have been kicked out of the Jedi Order and probably some imprisonment of some sort.  But the acting from Ian McDirmant and Ewan McGregor was excellent."
Sceneggiatura buona. Recitazione buona. Scenografia buona. Colonna sonora ottima. Complessivamente buon film; Voto: 8
"good lightsabers duels and visual effects, good ending for the prequels."
This explains how Anakin wanted to be a sith but meh it’s ok
I liked the sequels. there!!
Best Star Wars film ever in my opinion! It just truly shows how  Anakin became the dark lord we truly love.
My favourite movie by far
"The best one of the Prequel, I loved that first space battle scene"
Can't say i enjoyed it to be honest. I preferred the older movies.
Not a great film but the lightsaber fights and the final battle is awesome. Has the Starwars core and true to the mythos.
Should have been better but they wanted kids to be able to see this.
To me its proof that Lucas never planned out a prequel.  The worst prequel and still miles better than the Disney reboots. Violence for the sake of it. #NoRoleModels
The best of prequel movies by far. Great action scenes and Hayden's acting got a little better. Dialogue improved vastly from 1 and 2 as well.
"Hmpf! This movie is really good. Yet it can't shake of some of the stupid things the previous two failed at (bad dialogue, bad CGI etc). A shame because this could have been excellent!"
"it was for me yeah ok, however like all prequals you sort of know who isn't going to die and who are expendable, with all of these prequalgies of Star Wars i think the special effects aren't quite as good as they could be and let it down a little for me, prefered the special effects in the original trilogy but I'd be wrong to say this film hasn't grown on me as I've watched it a number of times now"
really good set of movies sequels don't get nearly as much love as they should.they're not perfect but they're way better than the Star wars movies were getting now.
Perhaps the greatest movie of all time
"I dont know why this movie get such hate, its so good"
"Of the prequels, this is the one I will watch more often and enjoy."
This is where the fun begins
An overwrought mess of a movie.
"Greatest movie ever, and not just cause the memes. I loved Anakin and Obi-Wan's relationship"
The entire reason I made this review was to return balance to the force and repair the view rating to 66.
A fine addition to my collection
This is where the fun begins.
This movie comes from the same breath as the mediocre prequels but feels like it came right out of the original trilogy.
A masterpiece of film making and the fulcrum upon which the greatest film saga to date rests.
better then the sequels
"Amazing movie, overhated but amazing"
"(sees the 65% audience score)
(visible confusion)"
A suprise to be sure but a welcome one.
"Despite the rocky start that the first two movies in the trilogy provided, Revenge of the Sith is an absolute masterpiece of film making and storytelling that perfectly bridges the prequel trilogy with the greater Star Wars lore. Best remembered due to it's numerous quotable lines and memorable action sequences, Revenge of the Sith is truly one of the few pieces of art that made it onto the big screen in the new corporate age of film making. 10/5 stars hands down."
Underrated gem with a great story that ties up some loose ends that the originals left hanging. Also very memable
"This is the best star wars since empire. A truly emotional and epic conclusion to the prequels, and, even tho it has it's problems, it's definitely an amazing movie"
This is where the fun begins.
Meme classical film! This film is for not only the men but women and children too.
"The most complete movie of the three Prequel Trilogy films, results in a very satisfying end to a series previously plagued by cheesy dialogue and cringy moments."
Honestly one of the very best movies I've ever seen. The sheer creativity in worldbuilding makes this one an essential must-watch movie.
always a fine choice for a movie night
I love the star wars franchise and this is the best of them all
The most comprehensive view of darth vader you will ever see: basically the one movie the entire star wars saga is set upon.
It will be done my lord.
"This is the best film I know. It tells of the fate of a corrupt state falling to fascism, the descent into darkness of a warrior and the conclusion of a destructive war"
My favorite of the saga
"Masterpiece.




Hello there!"
Most iconic movie ever.
The starwars prequals have the best memes.
"Easy good film ver fun such emotions better nerf itelia
Guacamole black person male genitalia"
Formative for a young nerd.
"On behalf of r/prequelmemes, the audience score must reach 66%. Execute order 66!"
This movie changed my whole life.
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
The finest prequel! Good action and you learn the origin of Darth Vader.
ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
"It will be done, my lord."
Best movie of all time
Nice action and story line great acting
"Revenge of the Sith is dark, fun and tragic culmination of the prequel trilogy. It might have poor dialogue, but, it still makes for an enjoyable and thrilling watch."
Overall a really good film aside from a few cheesy lines and a bit of bad acting. Overall a satisfying end to the otherwise meh prequel trilogy. A great climax and an amazing final fight scene makes this film great
Hello there. This is a perfect film. It's my favorite Star Wars movie. It has the most and the best Lightsaber duels by far. It is the biggest event in the entire saga. It also has the best and the most memes. There are so many great lines.
my second fav starwars movie right after empire got a bad score in part because of how bad episode I was
"My favorite in the Saga, very underrated film."
"Revenge of the Sith wasnâ(TM)t afraid to set a darker tone and was more competently made than the previous, albeit the cheesy dialogue and acting."
Definetly the best star wars movie so far
"One of my all time favorite Star Wars films, great storytelling without any over powered or invincible characters. Highly recommend."
These movies are boring.
miles better than the last jedi. If you liked the last jedi this makes that movie look like the room by comparison
"Way to ruin the original trilogy, George.  Can't introduce new generations to the series by showing them in chronological order because you fucked up the greatest reveal in cinematic history with that shit at the end of this film. =("
"Easily the BEST Star Wars movie (until now), we see the transformation of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader, breaking the heart fo his most loved ones to save them (or at least he thinked so), but in the process corrupting and surrendering to the Dark Side. It is filled with astounding action scenes, magnificent heart-breaking scenes and hard morale decisions."
The 6th entry in the main Star Wars franchise continues the fresh ideas of the series.
Now THIS is podracing! Best movie ever made. Do yourself a favor & don't ever watch the Disney star movies except for rogue one.
My fave Star Wars movie.
"Best of the prequels. I love the atmosphere, the story and the editing. Everything falls into place perfectly.

Georges Lucas is a Genius. It's so unfortunate that Disney ruined everything."
One of the best Star Wars movies ever.
The second best starwars
I miss when Star Wars was dark..
Waaaaaaaay underrated.
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
Amazing star wars movie
The best of the Prequel movies by far.
Anakin vs Obi-wan is just awesome
It's george lucas' star wars. What more to say.
"Despite an abnormally low audience score due to falsified reviews (which is shown by the enormously unrealistic number of them), Episode III deserves accolades for its interesting characters, thoughtful plot, satisfying conflict and resolution, well planned structure, and its amazing visuals. Even its dialogue is improved from the other two prequels. The last good Star Wars movie made (with the exception of Rogue One), and my personal favorite, with the story George Lucas tells really coming to the heart of what Star Wars is and represents. This movie is everything Rian Johnson is not and will never be. This movie is at the heart of a franchise this miscreant cannot understand as he seems to be too much of an ignoramus to understand how to strucutre a plot of design a cohesive expanded universe. The Last Jedi is not only a bad Star Wars film, but a terrible movie. The Revenge of the Sith, in contrast, is both a good movie and an amazing addition to the Star Wars universe."
The emotion in the last 20 minuets is breath taking. It has that feel that non of the previous two movies had
This movie belongs to Emperor Palpatine.
Action packed saved it
Best Star Wars movie to date
"The ending of the saga, and what an end. Almost perfect"
one of the best star wars movies not as good as empire strikes back but still great watching sky walker become Vader.
"As Lucas's last Star Wars film how does one rate this film today? Well sadly the dialogue and narrative continue to do nothing to engage you, still visually interesting and featuring satisfying action Revenge of the Sith concludes a flawed but fascinating legacy."
"Lucas used too much CGI but I like this film, is my favorite star wars movie although is sad. The action I like it, I mean the lightsaber fights are great."
"Iï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve never watched a movie that left my mind blown as much as this one. The main antagonist starts making some good points at the end, and you can empathize with ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2the chosen oneï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and his thought process through it all. The three dimensional characters that viewers can relate to made the movie very memorable, and the fact that the ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2good guysï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2bad guysï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? had some serious grey area for viewers to think about who they would have sided with in that situation made this movie amazing. I also like that they tied in events that happened in the preceding movies because it answered some of the questions I was left with after watching them. It also made me realize that the movies preceding this one (ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2The Phantom Menaceï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and âThe Clone Warsâ?)were not just standalone movies that were good in their own way, but they were actually building up to the awesome climax that ended this film. After the movie I was left pondering the events leading up to the climax along with the main antagonistï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s reasons to reconsider who is ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2goodï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and who is ï¿ 1/2 1/2  1/2badï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â?.This movie sparked my love for the Star Wars universe, and is by far my favorite of all the Star Wars movies. All in all it was a real 10/10 movie in my book, and I hope the franchise can work some of the positive aspects of this movie into its future movies."
"Despite some corny dialogue, this movie is the strongest in the prequels and one of the most emotional in the whole star wars saga, with a good runtime this installment is well done."
"Revenge of the sith Brings the Star Wars prequels to a satisfying , yet a heartbreaking end with the origin of Darth Vader ."
"great action scenes
pacing was good
acting was good
CGI and sound effects were amazing"
What a flip! I'm good. (10 seconds later) I'm evil. Nope. There are some tolerable fan edits of the entire trilogy which smooth out the transition but not this movie. A shame.
testing the tomatometer don't take this seriously
"awesome movie, top 3 of best of star wars movies George Lucas I love you"
"My favorite Star Wars. Tons of action, great story telling, nice execution of the lead to the next saga, and an amazing fun experience."
"Not bad, but not exactly good. There were some parts I enjoyed and there were parts that I did not. The whole prequel trilogy was a story that did not have to be told. Which usually does not bother me considering I like the standalone Star Wars movies. When I rewatch Star Wars movies this is hardly ever the one I watch."
"A huge improvement over the other prequels, but not something you go back to often."
"This is my favorite Star Wars prequel movie. Better yet, one of my top three Star Wars movies. It's got the impactful emotion of how Darth Vader came to be and everything, but I just think they shouldn't have made Grievous some sissy general. The movie had so much potential with giving General Grievous a character, but ultimately, it did fail. It's still a great movie though."
I really like it. Very exciting battles and the stakes are real. Even some heartbreaking parts that caught me by surprise.
"I know it's a prequel, but it's the best one and very enjoyable."
Best Star Wars movie out there
You cannot defeat the High Ground
"My second favourite star wars film, second to empire of course, definitely the best of the prequels and doesn't deserve such a low score."
"best star WARS MOVIE, PERIOD."
"Amazing movie, best of the prequel trilogy and is relatively a tie with The Empire Strikes Back. It takes everything the previous films were building toward and really delivered on the tragedy of Anakins fall to the dark side. How he did everything just to save his wife and how he felt betrayed by the Jedi. The large scale visuals were fantastic and characters were all interesting.  Did a great job giving us a story arc that leads into the story of the originals and makes us think of Vader in a whole new fashion. How Palpatine became the emperor from his manipulation and how the Jedi were wiped out. Simply incredible story, and couldnï¿ 1/2(TM)t have been as good without the build up of the previous 2 films."
"People like to say ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the darkest and best film of the saga, but I would dare to say ""Revenge of the Sith"" manages to be even more sinister and terrifying, as well as  a tad bit more exciting."
I actually prefer clone wars for world building. This is a better script. All of these prequels feel like they could be combined like the hobbit should have been.  I like them but I know they aren't very good. Childhood nostalgia and world building must be a lot of the reason. The use of cgi is fun and world building at least for me.
"Fantastic movie, the best Star Wars movie ever as far as I am concerned. Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Luke is born. The Emperor at his best, This movie has it all including the best lightsaber battle ever between Ob-Wan and Anakin. I have watched it countless times"
"George Lucus gives what STAR WARS fans have wanted since the beginning: the story of the tragic fall of Anakin Skywalker, the rise of the powerful Darth Sidious, and a riveting conclusion to the STAR WARS saga. REVENGE OF THE SITH hits the mark!"
"Gets better on subsequent viewings. Main weakness are some stilted dialogue and acting, but overall does an excellent job of wrapping up the trilogy and setting the tone for the next movie to occur chronologically."
The mythological themes of good vs evil and liberty vs tyranny are incredible.
"Quite epic, at least didnt do strange things like yoda in the VIII film"
Better than TLJ and solo and the remake of a new hope aka force awakens
It was OK.  Again I can't help but think that George Lucas plan for Darth Jar Jar would have been epic.
"Highly poignant and brilliant in its plot, this movie is one of the best Star Wars movies to date, though there is still room for improvement. The dialogue is less wooden than its previous counterparts, though still unrealistic for the most part, though highly memeable. I was highly disappointed with the depiction of Padme, a strong female heroine who was reduced to barefoot and pregnant in this movie with a rushed death that, in retrospect, was brilliant, but was not at all explained. It also frustrates me how she had to die for Anakin to have his character change. On a positive note, the portrays of Palpatine/Sidious by Ian McDiarmid, and Obi-Wan by Ewan McGregor were excellent. Additionally, the last fight between two of the main characters was undeniably the best fight in the Star Wars saga: beautifully choreographed, portraying how even the closest of friends can turn from brothers to enemies."
I love the part where theres sand and stuff lol yeah
FOR THE REPUBLIC. FOR DEMOCRACY!
This is where the fun begins
B E S T M O V I E E V E R
This is where the fun begins.
Greatest star wars film
"It concludes a trilogy that many may not appreciate, but it's a tragedy and a story of peace, justice and security."
Absolutely amazing 66/66
"Hello there! Seeing that this film had such a low audience was a surprise, but not a welcome one. However knowing that this will start to rise, this is where the fun begins."
The one of the best star wars movies and the best Prequel movie.
realy good movie ewan on his a game. prequel memes
Big Man says this is the best movie ever! 5/5
"Hello there! Even if this movie is considered bad and it had many flaws, it's still a gem compared to the Disney trash, namely TLJ. The lightsaber duels are amazingly choreographed and the movie respects the general in-universe lore (unlike the sequel trilogy) and does not feel like a blatant cashgrab. Also the meme factor and the fact that this movie has the cheesy feeling to it makes it worth a watch in my eyes.

My favourite Star Wars movie of all times <3
"It's surely underrated, and is a overall great Star Wars movie, despite some problems."
"With out a doubt this is the best prequel movie, some would argue that this is the best star wars movie."
"Although the acting and CGI isn’t the best we’ve seen, I still believe this is the most fun and most watchable Star Wars movie ever made. I can watch this movie over and over and still feel all the emotions that I felt during my first time watching the film. The character of Anakin goes through a troubling time so of course he’s going to be an emotional wreck throughout all the prequel movies. I don’t think the character of Anakin was written bad, I just think the way Hayden portrayed this character could’ve definitely been better. As for Padme, I think that her love with Anakin was a bit corny at times and could’ve done without some of those scenes. Obi-Wan, Grievous, and Palpatine to me were perfect and they were all played by amazing actors and I couldn’t see any other actors playing theses characters for me unlike Anakin and Padme. In my opinion, I can get over the bad CGI and dialogue and enjoy the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of the Empire and Darth Vader. At the end of the day this is just an opinion and enjoy what you want and dislike what you want. I in no way want to change your opinion, but I do want to make all sides heard. Thanks for reading :)"

A lot of lightsabers! epic. Too much CGI. I really felt the emotion in Obi-wan and Anakin.
Legendary and  a lot better than 1&2
A real return to top form
Honestly not as bad as people say it is
A triumph as far as how much ground had to be made up for ep I and II. Thrilling and amazing from beginning to end for me. As good as a New Hope for me personally.
"The best of the prequels. No question. Although it still had some laughable dialogue and wooden acting at times, this was a much more enjoyable ride. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid completely one the roles of Obi-Wan and the Emperor. The action was pretty too notch. Even though I’m not a huge fan of Yoda with a lightsaber, it still was cool to see him take on the Emperor. Hayden Christensen is also much better here than he was in the last movie. Thanks George Lucas you ended on a high note."
"For me this film failed in one of its most important story goals - explaining Anakin's turn to the dark side in a manner consistent with that described by Obi Wan in the first Star Wars.  Rather than being ""seduced"" by the dark side, it looked more like he was driven mad with worry over an uncertain future and an inability to control his emotions.  His descent from Jedi Hero to child-killing monster happened so rapidly that we didn't quite have time to fully grasp what was going on..  This gripe aside, ROTS was an amazingly exciting film to watch, with some great moments that have since become cornerstones of Star Wars legend.  I wish the sequel trilogy was up to this standard."
"While it has some weird dialogue and bounces back and forth with wipes, it is my favorite of the Star Wars movies and shows how a movie can balance emotion and action in such a great way."
Best of the prequels and 2nd best SW movie to Empire.
The film is action packed with thrilling and exiting duels and a overall good and emotional story...George Lucas really outdid this one.
"I honestly don't get what people have against the prequels, if you saw my previous star wars review i said i love star wars 1-6 flawlessly, revenge of the  sith is my all time favorite star wars movie and i love how  george lucas was not afraid to go dark with this film, this film just like star wars 1-6, gets 5 out of 5 stars, this film blew me away"
"A great film that has been used to create many memes and will continue to be one of the greatest films of all time, execute order 66"
It's treason then.
"Finally, this is how the movie is done. Not the best Star Wars film but it is the best of the prequel trilogy."
"This movie isnâ(TM)t perfect by any means, however it still makes for a great watch. Episode III redeems the bumpy start the prequels had. Two great fight scenes and a lot of important story telling.  A lot of people like to bash the prequels, but Iâ(TM)d like to put my 2 cents out there, give credit where itâ(TM)s due, and say that itâ(TM)s definitely worth watching!"
A well made ending to the otherwise bumpy prequel trilogy.The Force was strong with this one.
best in the prequil trilogy but alot of the acting was terrible
"A Very Tense, Emotional, Long Awaited Prequel"
"Revenge of the Sith becomes a suitable film to finish a great saga, where the story is strong and moving, with exceptional battles and a well developed plot, despite having a few weak moments."
"In context, it fits perfectly and is easily the best prequel. Perhaps on par with Return of the Jedi for me."
"The current greatest Star Wars prequel, and the best of the prequel trilogy"
Nothing to add here.
"Many fans and critics seemed to have hopped on board with this final installment of George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels. I believe more than a few simply convinced themselves of the film's greatness due to Anakin's transition to Darth Vader, and I will admit, the final half hour indeed delivers the goods and reminds us all why we fell in love with ""Star Wars"" to begin with. But, I can't remain oblivious to Lucas' lack of skill when it comes to dialogue, character development and providing a soul to his story. Overall, it provides a lot more than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" though that's not saying much. However, when it comes to reaching the level of greatness that Lucas once did with his original trilogy, it pales in comparison."
Best movie of all time
"After the colossal disappointments that were the previous two films in the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith brings a significantly darker tone, perhaps the darkest Star Wars have ever seen, and I can find few flaws in the movie. It really does build up to the original trilogy's plot quite well, and offers a very satisfying yet incredible payoff for the series. It really does a lot to build the Star Wars universe. One cannot also understate the lightsaber duels in this movie, easily being some of the best. I even want to mention the soundtrack, particularly the backdrop to Order 66, which really adds a lot to the scene, and even on several re-watches is still haunting and lovely. The criticisms I would level at this film would primarily revolve around the continued love narrative between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, which fails to add much to the story and still fails to come across as even remotely sincere. In addition, Jar Jar Binks remains, for some reason, although his involvement is incredibly minimal, thankfully. These negatives can be easily overlooked however, and I would consider this to be on the same level as Empire Strikes Back, the best of Star Wars."
Best of the prequels
"I enjoy Revenge of the Sith  as much as, if not, more than Return of the Jedi. I find it to be a very underrated movie, even with all of its flaws. This movie has great action, a great (but occasionally cheesy) story about Anakin's turn to the dark side. This movie also benefits from great action and some of the best soundtrack in the series. Sure, the movie does suffer from Hayden Christiansen's cheesy acting, and certain aspects of the movie could be better, but I think it's a great way to conclude the somewhat disappointing prequel trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is good, but not great. It gets a 7/10."
Although I hate the prequel trilogy if I had to pick a favorite it would be this one. Ill say 65
My favorite Star Wars movie!
"While the CGI and script leave much to be desired, this was actually a good movie, especially when compared to the disney garbage."
"It got some great action scenes but the overall plot is not very compelling at all, and the reason Anakin turns to the dark side just does not work, also it takes to fast. And as well there are some terrible moments as well as Hayden Christensen does not do a good job with portraying Anakin."
Imperfect but thoroughly enjoyable. This is suitably dark with epic action and some great dramatic scenes. There are a few bits which could have been done better but overall this is a great success.
This film was almost good.
The best prequels movie is the second best STAR WARS movie and my favorite movie.
This movie just gets better over time.  Since i fall into the OT group by age this is by far my most favorite of the prequels better than  most of the other Star wars movies.  If you are having issue with Episode 1 or 2 this one will make it worth the pain
The birth of Darth Vader was very awesome
"People claim this is the ""good"" star wars prequel. Well I have a hard time believing that the other 2 can be as bad as this and at this point I'm too afraid to find out."
"Il meno peggio della trilogia prequel, ma questo non vuol dire che sia un bel film. Ma neanche totalmente brutto. Ha i suoi momenti, come delle divertenti scene d'azione e qualche dialogo incredibilmente ispirato, per essere lo stesso film che contiene lo scambio di battute: ""Sei bellissima"" ""È perché sono molto innamorata"". Già... purtroppo i dialoghi e le scene cringe non mancano neanche in questo terzo e fortunatamente ultimo episodio prequel, così come non mancano la piattezza della maggior parte dei personaggi, la storia noiosa, raffazzonata e difficile da seguire e tutti gli altri elementi che ci hanno fatto odiare i due precedenti abomini della trilogia. In sostanza, questo film riesce tutto sommato a risultare godibile, merito soprattutto del finale, che si ricollega finalmente alla trilogia storica nel modo più epico ed enfatizzato possibile, anche se, anche qui, non mancano le classiche cappellate alla Lucas, come il famigerato ""nooooo"""" urlato da Anakin/Darth Vader, o la morte più stupida dell'intera saga (chi ha visto il film sa a quale personaggio mi riferisco). Insomma, definite questo episodio III un bel film è forse troppo, ma può quantomeno risultare quello che ep. I e II non erano e non saranno mai: intrattenimento senza pretese."
Revenge of the Sith is my favorite star wars film.  Hayden Christensen is once again great in star wars and cool action scenes make this movie awesome
"The dialogue may have been bad, but overall this movie is entertaining, rewatchable, and tells a great story, even if it had to get through a lot of details in a rather small amount of time. This is the darkest and most emotional Star Wars film, which works well here. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is amazing here in my opinion, which helped as well. This is a very enjoyable film, a huge improvement from the previous two movies."
There isn't a better movie anywhere anytime ever. This is the one.
Out of the Prequels easily the best. But had its flaws. Most people give prequels a bad name but if the 2 prior was like this one then they would be better.
"Wow. Just wow. Star Wars has done the impossible. They have actually ruined movies. The hype on these things was a lesson to all audience members; you don't always get what you wish for.

To be honest , I don't know who was still watching these things. After the first 2, it was only going to get worse. But it got slightly better. This movie had a direction, and an actual plot, something that you want in your big blockbuster franchise. And to be honest, at one time, this was actually my favorite Star Wars movie. But, watching it over again, I now realize where it lost its footing. A horrible script really drove this movie into the ground. As for any other complaints for this movie: Hayden Christiansen."
The best episode of the original trilogy
"An amazing conclusion to the series. As far as im concerned this IS the last star wars film released since Disney made the franchise garbage.

Love the tragedy of darth plaguis the wise as well as see anakin transform into vader.

The musical scores are brilliant and the fights are amazing and epic"
la unica buena de las precuelas
"Loved it, best star wars from the prequels"
"The memes are good, the story not so much."
It was a surprise to be sure but a welcome one when I found out that this movie had so many great moments and happy landings. The tragedy of Anakin and Darth Plagueis was wonderful with the depth and lore it added to the franchise. This movie has the high ground above all the other prequels and is always there to say hello there when Im looking for something to watch
"It's a great movie, this movie is before the clone wars series (3D), so it shows us some part of that war between droids and clones, that is something characteristic of this saga. And also it has the greatest fight.  Anakin vs Obi-Wan so far the best even counting the news movies of Disney."
"The birth of Darth Vader concludes the trilogy as a bombastic interstellar opera.
On renewed viewing I still think that Anakin Skywalker's metamorphosis to Darth Vader a bit unconvincing; much of the fun comes from the supporting characters and diverse aliens."
Best of the prequels
"Even though Hayden Christensen is given the worst dialogue and direction possible, the rest of Revenge of the Sith actually feels like a Star Wars movie.

Visual storytelling, a good mythos, and possibly the greatest lightsaber fight at the end make the film an enjoyable watch.

8/10"
"Of the prequel trilogy, this is the film that most matches the emotion and force filled action of the originals."
Best movie ever made
My favorite Star Wars movie by far
Very underrated my personal favorite movie of star wars
I liked the clone wars part of this movie. And of course the memes! Anakin may have been annoying but at least he got what's coming to him in the end! And again they aren't just re using old plot lines! Sad that it even has to be mentioned.
"The best reviewed prequel in the franchise for over ten years and rightfully so, ""Revenge of the Sith"" still suffers from the occasional poor dialogue and plot hole. But Lucas gives it his all in terms of visual storytelling and delivers a satisfying conclusion to the Republic. John Williams gives his best score since ""Empire..."" and Ben Burtt's sound design gets two big thumbs up. Revisit it soon if you haven't seen it in a while, it's likely better than you remembered it."
The only prequel that is actually good besides (technically) Rogue One
"Definitely not as good as any of the Star Wars films. We all kinda hoped the prequel trilogy itself was already just erased from the Star Wars universe. Nobody is more of a pity than Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker. Leave it to the real jedi, Luke. I actually want these films to be remade. The film itself isn’t very bad, but the everything it contains is just horrible and last generation CGI."
The Best movie of the saga and One of my favorites in general
Best of the prequel trilogy.
One of my favourite Star Wars films. Prequel or not I don't care. Growing up during the prequels this was my favourite movie.
"A great conclusion to the rocky Star Wars prequels, is it perfect? Far from it. Anakin's turn feels fast in this film, understandably so as George Lucas only had one film to make a character take a major change in character from conflicted and emotional to murdering Sith Lord. Being critical and taking nostalgia out of the equation as much as possible for someone who grew up with the prequels as well as the original Star Wars movies I think this is critically the best of the Star Wars prequels."
Best Star Wars prequel movie. The fall of Anakin Skywalker. Classic ending.
"this is by far the best way to experince the prequels
You underistame my memes"
In my top 5 favorite films list.
Liking just for the memes.
"Highly overrated film. For so many years ever since I was a 9-year-old kid, I loved this movie, but after watching Mr. Plinkett's review video of this movie on YouTube, I realize that this movie is actually bad. All of the characters in this movie are dumb, except for Darth Sidious/Palpatine. All the characters (except Palpatine) lack cohesive thoughts. The only reason I gave this a three star rating instead of a two and a half star rating is because Jar Jar Binks is barely in the movie, John Williams' amazing soundtrack, the entertaining action scenes, the attempt at emotional scenes, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and the movie just being fun (but that's it, it's just a fun movie, not a good movie). The CGI has not aged well. There is still too much overuse of CGI. The acting (mainly from Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman) is a lot worse than I remembered. The Star Wars prequels are poorly made, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, and poorly executed films. There are big continuity errors in this movie. Anakin wasn't seduced by the dark side, he was tricked into going to the dark side. In A New Hope, Obi-Wan said that Vader was seduced by the dark side. In Return of the Jedi, Leia told Luke that she remembered her birth mother and said that she was always sad. In Revenge of the Sith, after Padme gave birth to the twins Luke and Leia, she died a few seconds later with no explanation whatsoever. There is no logical way Leia could've remembered that. The Mace Windu vs. Palpatine lightsaber duel scene was badly choreographed and laughable. Darth Sidious should not have used a lightsaber in this movie. In Episode VI, he referred to a lightsaber as ""a Jedi's weapon"". That scene was so unintentionally hilarious that it looked like a parody/comedy. That fight scene was so stupid that it spawned so many memes. The acting and dialogue was so laughably bad that a bunch of the lines from that scene became memes. Mace Windu brought three Jedi Masters with him but all three of them got taken out so quickly and easily. The Jedi purge scene could've been emotional and great if we had known at least a few of the Jedi who died. None of them had any character development, so it was hard to feel any emotion when they died during the Order 66 scene. I know a lot of people are going to say that you have to watch The Clone Wars show to get emotionally invested in those characters, but if I have to watch a TV show to understand a movie and to feel emotions for the characters, then the movie fails. Movies need to stand on their own. I shouldn't have to rely on the lore to understand the prequels or any movie for that matter. The Star Wars prequels rely too much on the lore and The Clone Wars show for things that are never explained in the movies. It's been so many years since I watched Star Wars: The Clone Wars, so I can't remember any of the Jedi who died and can't get emotionally invested with the characters. Another huge problem with the Jedi purge/Order 66 scene is that it used far too much CGI and the visual effects did not even age well at all. Some parts of the scene literally looked like a video game cutscene. Obi-Wan said too many cheesy one-liners and some of them didn't even make sense. The dialogue in Episode III is still terrible and awkward like the previous prequels. Anakin and Obi-Wan's lightsaber duel with each other in the third act on Mustafar was ridiculously overchoreographed. The final battle went for too long and it kind of mostly feels like it was just them showing off their cool moves and stunts rather than having a realistic and emotional final battle. Also a lot of the acting (mainly from Christensen and Portman, but mostly Christensen) and dialogue (especially from Anakin) on Mustafar was so horrible that it was laughable and unintentionally hilarious. I felt like I was watching a comedy instead of a serious action/space opera film. And Darth Vader screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" at the end was extremely overdramatic and corny. Episode III ruined Darth Vader. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is definitely the best and most watchable of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, but it is still a pretty bad film. I can only now see this film as a guilty pleasure. Hence why I gave it a three star rating.

Rating: 4.8/10"
"Probably the darkest chapter in the Star Wars saga yet, Revenge of the Sith makes up  for the previous two Star Wars movies' failures."
"After two disappointing previous instalments, the Star Wars prequel trilogy finally gave us a satisfying film. It still has a lot of the same issues as the first two - some of the dialogue is pretty poor, and Hayden Christensen still isn't convincing as Anakin - but the pacing is considerably improved, the plot is more focused and engaging, and the action scenes (especially Obi-Wan vs Anakin) are well-done. Not the best in the series, but still a solid film."
This is the story Lucas wanted to tell at the start and it is the story the fans wanted to see.
The best of the prequels
"One of the best of the prequel trilogy, action scenes were a little over the top."
"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie in the prequel trilogy. George Lucas finally brings us the Star Wars Story that fans have been waiting for since 1977 when A New Hope was released. Three years into the Clone Wars, the Jedi rescue Palpatine from Count Dooku. As Obi-wan pursues a new threat, Anakin acts as a double agent between the Jedi Council and Palpatine and is lured into a sinister plan to rule the galaxy.

 The film builds us tension really well and that makes it better. It has the best action scenes in the prequels because the final fight between Anakin Obi-Wan was brilliant. My only problem with this movie is that Hayden Christensen acting is terrible but the acting is redeemed with a terrific performance by Ian Mcdiarmid. The ending of the film is my favourite scene because it is the most emotional scene in the film. It is probably the most emotional Star Wars film and is also the most enjoyable prequel for the entire family to enjoy.  George Lucas has directed the star wars saga very well and now he has drawn it to at close with this astounding film.

Grade A+"
"Revenge of the Sith is, what I consider to be, the least bad of the prequel films.

The lesser of three evils, if you will.

My opinion is probably based on the fact that I enjoy dark, adult-themed movies. Revenge of the Sith is definitely a step in that direction, although it does feel extremely contrived at times.

My biggest issue with this film is that Anakin's (Hayden Christensen) turn to the Dark Side feels forced and unconvincing. I know that Lucas was attempting something meaningful when Anakin ended up being the death of Padme (Natalie Portman), but it just doesn't work.

As with the previous two films, Revenge of the Sith is plagued with atrocious writing and horrible performances. Ian McDiarmid, who had previously been the constant bright spot in terms of acting, devolves into laughable overacting.

As I was beginning to write this review, I realized that I couldn't remember a single thing about the first half of the film. I had just finished watching it. The plot with General Grievous was so uninteresting and dumb that my memory had decided to purge itself.

A coughing robot with functioning organs? What?

I mean, Jar Jar Binks is still the worst character in the trilogy, but Grievous comes close.

Honestly, one of the things that bothers me most about the whole horrible prequel trilogy is the character of Padme. She's a Queen and, later, a Senator... and yet she is written to be completely useless. She has no agency of her own. Her entire story is focused on her infatuation with Anakin. She can't even survive childbirth, because she's so heartbroken about him.

This from the same man who wrote the character of Leia Organa.

Really, George? Really?"
One word: masterpiece
Anakin's fall to the darkside is executed very well. This movie is dark and emotional and has the best score in the saga. This movie is a satisfying epic conclusion to the series and has amazing action sequences. Hayden Christensen's performance is also excellent.
