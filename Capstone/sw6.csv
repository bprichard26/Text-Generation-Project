"Proving it is difficult for lightning to strike three times, this finale to the original trilogy is nevertheless an exciting ride and works very well as closure to the first round of films."
About as poor as the previous two. So pleased to have got through this trilogy. Lockdown makes people do weird things. Never watching these things again. Awful.
A good film. An alright Star Wars. Not as endearing as the first two but still a very well crafted movie. The Luke and Vader story is the heart of the film and keeps the interest in the story. But it is still Star Wars and it is still amazing.
"No ultimo filme da trilogia, não há nada de muito novo.

Chegou um momento no qual comecei a questionar-me da tamanha conveniência. Sim , eu sei que o foco do projeto é o publico infantil, mas isso não impede o desenvolvimento dos personagens. O filme me soou corrido demais, como se ele tivesse que acabar de qualquer jeito. Não vemos a progressão de nada. Apenas é posto em tela e é esperado que acreditemos.

Quanto ao desenvolvimento, chegamos a nos questionar sobre determinados elementos do universo, que não tem minimas respostas até então - nem no ""subcontexto"". Como eu disse, o foco do filme é um publico que não costume ligar pra isso, mas aumentar o numero de filmes dessa aventura em especifico e diversificar seria a melhor opção na minha cabeça. Ainda sim, foi uma experiencia boa, só poderia ser bem melhor."
My personal favorite Star Wars movie.
"While not as good as the others in the trilogy it’s still really good, with great effects and characters. Just the pacing is a bit off"
"Equally amazing as the other five, great end to the open-ended Prequel Trilogy and Original Trilogy."
The amazing climatic finale of Star Wars for the original trilogy! George Lucas and ILM outdone themselves again with the special effects and battles. Still one of the greatest space battle ever made. Luke and Vader's final showdown along with the legendary John Williams score help sell the pain and anger going through them. Ian Mcdiarmid cackling and insidious performance as the Emperor who we at long last finally get to meet in person on screen despite his short screen time was enough to sell how much of a menace he was. Nothing better than a feel good ending with the celebration excluding the most likely cannibalistic ewoks on Endor who maybe ate the other dead Imperials. Still the celebration was beautiful!
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is how you properly end an amazing trilogy!"
"a slight decline for the saga, but still an epic finale"
"The original George Lucas trilogy concludes with Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, and the narrative revolves around the rebels' efforts to bring down the Empire and the second Death Star. Filmmaker Richard Marquand, from a script by Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, does a fantastic job of immediately starting the relatively quick procedures, as the film begins with an exciting opening leg detailing Han Han's rescue from the clutches from Harrison Ford from Jabba the Hutt. From there, however, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi advances to an episodic midsection that, unfortunately, is often as padded as it is absorbing, with the continued emphasis on the exploits of the protagonists on the home planet. Ewok Endor certainly perpetuating the erratic vibe (meaning most of these things aren't terribly interesting). On the other hand, it is so clear that the film features a series of typically stellar moments and sequences, with the entirety of the final act, involving a series of electrifying battles, rather than offsetting the somewhat lackluster nature of the film. midsection. (There are also some calmer, more fascinating scenes, including a heart-to-heart affective conversation that takes place between brothers Luke and Leia.) The delightful and delightful conclusion, in addition to finally putting the Ewoks to good use, ensures that Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi ends on a highly positive note, securing its place as the culminator of a solid trilogy that."
The ewoks and Han Solo ruined this movie for me but the final act is outstanding! I found the film mostly boring
The stakes are as high as ever as our rebel friends need to reunite one last time to defeat the evil galactic empire.
The last great Star Wars movie.
"A less emotionally mature, but still an adventurous and satisfyingly concluding sequel to the groundbreaking trilogy."
"Originally, I was not a big fan of this movie but I rewatched it and I loved it. None of the scenes to me dragged on or felt too short and this movie has one of the best final battles with the battle in Ednor, destroying the Death Star and Darth Vader, the Emperor and Luke combined with emotional feelings, great action and CGI makes for a very satisfying ending to the unforgettable OG. The acting and dialogue is great and the story was well-structured and it manages to capture the same magic and heart as the first 2 Star Wars Movies:
Overall: 9.5/10 (A+)"
"The pros and cons of Return of the Jedi...Star Wars' weaker entry of the original series of 1st 3.  
I finally watched again Return of the Jedi after so many years gone by as lots of time to kill during this epidemic and the ending is so very weak and bad!  The celebration dances after blowing up the Death Star yet AGAIN are so very pointless with no rhythm and made no sense to dance like that with some Ewoks to that style of music!
The Ewoks are so bloody wimpy and how do the Stormtroopers get taken out so easily with all that armor on by sticks and arrows and even small rocks!  Is it a comedy???
Lando has zero dance moves as a Black guy, really?  
Too many special effect flaws when Empire was 3 years prior and Star Wars New Hope 6 years prior and both had better effects!...???  Both were more interesting too and NO bloody EWOKS!  Worst characters ever...Ewoks and Jar Jar!  
Yoda had as little screen time as Boba Fett...both very awesome characters only wasted in screen time potential action.
Some good in the movie...the whole start with Jabba and the Rancor and all the way up to the Ewoks showing up.  Plus the space battles were quite good for this time period.  

Killing Boba Fett so very easily...Lucas...you fool!  This lost as many marks as the whole Ewok idea. 

Original Star Wars...10 out of 10
Empire Strikes Back...another 10 and even better
Jedi...lucky to get a 5.5 but only cause it is a Star Wars franchise movie with a few good efforts

2 hrs and 15 mins running time...make it an even 2 hrs and get rid of the Ewoks and the dreaded dancing at end!!! 

The movie poster was quite good though!  And its quite visual minus the lacking special effects. 

I think this is it, the very last time I ever watch Jedi...I am good forever!"
"Though it is not as good as the 1st 2, I still recommended"
"It is the best episode of all Star Wars series. Worth watching it, even though I am a huge anti-fan of this whole saga."
Best star wars movie of all time. It has the best writing and deserves to have the title as the best movie of all time!
"It's goofy but fun, a fitting ending to the original trilogy"
"É um bom filme, porém poderia ser melhor, considero o mais fraco dessa trilogia e é nisso que acho que ele peca pois já que é o último deveria ser o melhor mas ainda assim gosto do filme pois o que dizer de Star wars se não que é tudo maravilhoso"
"A New Hope gave everyone Star Wars.  Empire showed us that Star Wars has the emotional range to engage the mature.  Return of the Jedi reminded us that Star Wars is for everyone, and in the midst of Luke's pivotal defiance of darkness, our still-living Han and buddies team up with teddy bears.  That is Star Wars as a whole summed up quite nicely; serious, life-or-death stakes, solved with kids toys."
"Battle of Endor is intereting (with teddy bears gamboling about, who wouldn't be amused?) and the finale is just about right, in my opinion. But seriously, where's that medal for Chewie???"
"Return of the Jedi is a satisfying finale to the original Star Wars trilogy and the Ewoks are the greatest alien species in Star Wars. Most of the characters from previous films are just as likeable and Darth Vader's redemption is well-earned and feels genuine. However, Luke is really arrogant and annoying in the movie and makes the movie decrease in value for me."
"I love Return of the Jedi. This movie is great in so many ways. It's one of my favorite 1980s movies. My favorite scene is the Tatooine scene with Jabba the Hutt. I found it very entertaining. The only issue with this film is the Ewoks that are making the battle harder for stormtroopers to fight which doesn't really make sense. Stormtroopers should easily be able to fight Ewoks. Other than that, it's a great story."
stunning end to the saga
es perfecta la película
"It is not as good as the previous two movies, but The Return of the Jedi is nonetheless a satisfying conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy with epic action and an engaging narrative with many twists and turns."
This is a disappointment compared its predecessors but keeps the Star Wars spirit alive with a worthy third act
"This third installment of the original Star Wars movies was very good. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, James Earl Jones, and the rest of the cast did a spectacular job in this movie. The actions scenes and the special effects were awesome. The plot to the movie was very good as well. This is a definite must see."
"The emotions run deep, the action is better than before, and it's rather engaging, especially compared to its predecessors. 92%."
"This largely underappreciated gem went everywhere that its, while enjoyable, admittedly mainstream predecessors were too common to explore, and for that reason I will NEVER EVER forget Return of the Jedi."
"Ending was pretty great! The movie was great too. I guess if I was a Star Wars fan, I would have gone crazy about this. I still liked it. Chewy is my favorite character."
great instalment of the 3rd film of the original trilogy
"Probably the weakest film in the original trilogy but it still is an amazing film. It's fun, exciting, and is a somewhat perfect ending that ends the trilogy is a satisfying way."
"Return of the Jedi flings back to the non-dark tone that ""A New Hope"" had compared to its successor ""Empire Strikes Back."" Return of the Jedi wrapped up everything correctly that was set for our favorite heroes Luke, and Leia Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. It has its flaws, but it doesn't mean that it wasn't a bad Star Wars movie."
"It's not quite as great as Episode 4 or 5, but still a great watch. It's the ideal ending to Luke's story."
"While it's film making is a little less breathtaking than Empire Strikes back. Return of the Jedi is a fun, entertaining, and truly endearing story with its fantabulous writing, characters, visuals, and score. And of course, Ian McDiarmid's palpatine is still the greatest villain of all time."
"George might have had a bit too much control of this one - it lacks many of the complex elements that made Empire so great, but it's still a solid conclusion to the original trilogy, even with the Ewoks."
it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!it's beautiful!!!!
This movie concluded a revolutionary masterpiece of a film trilogy in the best way. This is a film to 100% see.
A masterpiece of Lucas
"Great film. The best aspects of the movie are the Luke-Vader scenes. Vader's redemption is what makes this film marvelous. The Ewoks are not problematic. However, Jabba's Palace is primarily due to Luke's plan, but it's forgivable."
"A really fun and energetic conclusion to the first star wars trilogy.
Not quite as perfect as Empire Strikes Back,but still phenominal"
Epic conclusion to an epic trilogy.
"I do feel that this movie is the weakest of the Original Trilogy, but I love it a lot. This movie has amazing action sequences and character arcs that end in an excellent way."
"From the lightsaber battles to the love stories and tragedy,  this film was the way to end the original trilogy. Like the other Star Wars it's holds the ability to be rewatched a hundred times and more."
"The weakest of the originals but is still amazing, the ending is better than Revenge Of The Sith's ending, and now after watching the overall ending in The Rise Of Skywalker i understood that if Star Wars was just the originals it was perfect."
Started out with exitment and ended with non satisfaction!
The last act of the this lame movie moved me to tears many times
"Suggested Audience: Everyone |
Critical Rating: A |
Nostalgia Factor: Insane |
Viewings: 4+ |
Detail: The final volume of the original trilogy, this film provides a satisfying conclusion to an industry changing series. Not a lot of films can boast that, and as such, it deserves a chance from every moviegoer."
"Awesome! The second best SW saga!! A great joy of the film, Return of the Jedi was great before, but thanks to the special edition is much better. The fans and people can said what they will of negative notes, but Lucas did the right thing to changes whole the movie. It was supposed to be this way in 1983, but in many reasons he cannot put this original story in his time. Im glad he made a great connection of the prequel. The true ending  of SW saga, respectfully for the special surprise of the planets, ending music & most of all the spirit Force of Anakin(Hayden great cameo)! True Star wars conclusion!!"
"Pros: Palpatine is a great villain and the best he has been in the saga. Darth Vader is great. Luke Skywalker is the best character in this movie and I love him as a Jedi Knight and how powerful he has become. The Jabba scene is fun.  Yoda's death is quite emotional. The speeder scene is fun and the Ewoks capturing Han Solo and everyone else accept Leia. The battle of Endor is epic and I like the Ewoks and this is the best third act in StarWars in my opinion. The arc with Luke Skywalker is fantastic with him trying not to turn to the Darkside. The lightsaber fight between Vader and Luke is my favorite in the original trilogy. The scene where Luke cuts off Vader's hand is great because he realizes his father did this to him and if he continues he will turn to the Dark side. So he refuses and Palpatine uses sith lightning on him to kill Luke. Darth Vader turning to the light side at that moment is perfect and him taking the Emperor and killing him was great and he phophil's the prophecies of Anakin bringing balance to the force. Vader's death scene is the most emotional death scene in all of Starwars and Luke being the only one at his funeral is really powerful writing. 

Cons: While the first 40 minutes in Jabba's palace were fun, It feels useless and it doesn't need to be there and it is just there to save Han and is very disjointed. They even had someone break the fourth wall and run up and scream at the camera. The death of Boba Fett is stupid because he just gets knocked over by an item and falls into the monster and this is the guy that captured Han Solo. There should have been a fight and it was not funny and it annoys me. Luke and Leia being a sibling felt odd to me because they never hinted at it in Empire Strikes Back and it came off as weird because there was a love triangle between Han, Luke, and Leia and it doesn't have the pay off it should have had. This movie also got worse after Rising of Skywalker because Vader phophilling the prophecy feels less satisfying because (Spoiler Alert) he is still alive.

Overall I still really like this film even though it is my least favorite in the original trilogy but that's not saying much because it is a good film. I'm going to give StarWars Episode 6 Return of the Jedi a (B+)"
Fine. Not as good as the others though. The script is bad and the pacing is slow. This movie is just boring for two thirds. The finale is cool though.
"though not really perfect, it is quite entertaining. Seeing Luke become from a whiny and loud teenager to a serious and steady Jedi Knight was fun. Seeing Darth Vader kneeling to The Emperor was surprising to some, and Ian McDiarmid acted The Emperor perfectly, and the ending fight when Luke swings his lightsaber at Darth Vader savagely is quite tense."
Filme fantástico que fecha bem a trilogia
"An exciting conclusion to the greatest movie trilogy of all time.  While few action/adventure films in the 80s (without the name ""Star Wars"" in the title) could match Return of the Jedi, in this era of three-or-more Marvel movies a year it doesn't hold up quite as well as its two predecessors.  Still, sequences like the first act at Jabba's palace, and the introduction of Ian McDiarmid's iconic Emperor, make Return of the Jedi incredible fun even today."
"Best of the OT! Ewoks, action, and a second Death Star? Did I mention EWOKS?"
It got too cute.  Less singing and dancing and stuffed animals would have been nice.  Still has some iconic sequences in between the fluff.
A clear example of a STAR WARS MOVIE
"Not as good as Empire, but good conclusion. I loved the green saber as a child :)"
Second best movie of the entire franchise. 2/11 to date.
"A complete entertainment, a feast for the eyes and a delight for the fancy."
Several nostalgic moments in this movie.
"Of course the action and effects in this movie are outstanding: (the Jabba, Endor, and Space sequences being some of the best in the franchise), but the redemptive themes and closing out of Luke's character arc are what make this one of my favorite movies ever."
"Good story, not as great as its predecessors. But is still worthwhile."
"Just slightly not as good as ""Empire"" (the greatest film ever made IMO); and just as important to pop culture as ""Empire"" and ""A New Hope"" are. ROTJ is full of epic moments; arguably the greatest space battle ever put to screen; and one of the greatest redemption arcs in cinematic history. A fitting end to the original SW trilogy."
"Bom, ursinhos estragam"
"83 was a great year for these kind of movies, and the ending to the Original Trilogy is just perfect! In fact, this installment is perfect! This is truly the best STAR WARS sequel and STAR WARS film of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I can't say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said.
"7.25/10. 'Return of the Jedi' is the weakest of the original Star Wars films. Where the first two pushed boundaries and innovated, 'Return of the Jedi' was content to do little more than end the story in uninspired - albeit entertaining - fashion. There isn't anything inherently wrong with making a simple, breezy, popcorn-ready flick, but being anything less than ground-breaking like it's predecessors were is a recipe for disappointment. The plot doesn't seem to have any forward thrust; after a thrilling first act, the story settles into well-troden territory by following the blueprint of 'A New Hope' - a gang of rebels must defeat the empire and it's giant destructo-ship. It's unfortunate that the creativity and character development from 'The Empire Strikes Back' couldn't carry over. The movie was still quite entertaining, as any fan of the effects-driven action sequences, so viscerally brought to life by a top-notch technical crew, can attest. Another familial twist and the final redemption arc that sees peace restored to the galaxy are interesting nuggets, and Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor is a scene stealer. 'RotJ' wraps up this trilogy with technical wizardry and fun, but opted for safe, crowd pleasing mundanity instead of creative daring. It could and should have been much more, but ultimately stands as a testament to the complacency that often follows success, and foreshadows the overarching creative issues found in Lucas' prequel trilogy."
It had the best action of the original trilogy but the Ewoks were annoying and the plot was similar to A New Hope.
"Entertaining, conclusive, thoughtful, good performances, special effects and a great story is what allows Return Of The Jedi to be a good close to the original trilogy."
"This is my favourite Star Wars movie because of the excellent storyline and the amazing scenes like the scene where Luke fights the Rancor, the Sarlac Pit scene, the Battle On Endor scene, Darth Vader vs Luke Skywalker scene, and the space battle scenes. Another reason this movie is great is because of the adorable Ewoks!"
An absolute classic.
"I love this movie the Ewoks are lovable characters and are a great part of the movie the whole scene with Luke, Darth Vader, and Emperor is amazing and one of the best scenes in movie history and there are just so many more great things about this movie"
This is without a doubt my most favorite movie of all time! This is the best Star Wars Film without a doubt!
I love this movie. It is a classic should watch movie.
"Good finale of the whole saga, amazing visuals and music and Anakin's redemtion by Luke."
"It has Ewoks, but it's AMAZING"
"An exciting end to the original trilogy, combined with Marquand's direction, Lucas and Kandan's script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Hume's cinematography, Lucas, Barton and Dunham's editing, Reynolds' production design, Ford and Lange's set decoration, Rodgers and Jamero's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Return Of The Jedi is a great and fitting end to the original trilogy!!!"
"While the movie suffers from some questionable choices, it still is a great watch and has some of the greatest highlights of the entire franchise."
Also the best of this trilogy
"the best star wars movie, every location and scene is brilliant"
"A great film although not without its weak points, a great conclusion to a world renowned trilogy."
Yeah this is a great Movie
"Entertaining movie, great casting, memorable characters, fantastic storyline, action-packed movie"
"Good movie, but not as good as A New Hope or Empire.  But, then again, very few movies are."
"Good Stuff: The action, the greatest battle of the original trilogy, the amazing conclusion, the best ending in all of star wars.
Bad Stuff: Boba fett is dissapointing, and if you think about it lukes beginning plan to reduce Han is very… flawed."
Amazing I love this film <3
GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
"I enjoyed it. Good emotional ending for Vader and Luke. The ewoks attacking the Storm Troopers was a fun fight scene. Not as good as Empire Strikes back, but better than the prequels and holds up to some of the current ones. Solid concept, solid execution."
Very good. A little off for the OG trilogy but still awesome.
The film is a must see. The first sequence on Tatooine is so action packed and serves to expose our heroes' developments. Dark Sidious is a very nice addition the star wars lore.
"Not as good as empire or revenge of the sith, but a solid star wars movie to end the trilogy."
"Awesome conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. Wraps up the story of Episodes 4-6 on a high note, completing the main characters evolution and journey in a way you may or may not have expected. It was also a visual marvel at the time, that has stood the test of time."
"Though not as imaginative as the previous two, Return of the Jedi is a satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy."
"A bit of a slow start leads to plenty of action and a worthy finale to the original trilogy of star wars films. Its hard not to remember the associated memes as each classic line is delivered, but they are only poked fun at because they are so iconic. There is a reason that they keep making Star Wars films, people want space battles, speeder-bike chases, lightsaber duels, blaster fights and all that jazz, and this one delivers it all."
"Don't get me wrong I absolutely love this movie along with many other installments I just feel that some scenes don't really grab my attention like the others do but there are still some of my favorite in the franchise scenes like the space battle, and the lightsaber fight and luke turning one of the most dangerous people in the galaxy to the light side, is really over all a good movie."
"Amazing, the Ewoks I admit were a little annoying, but such a great way to end the trilogy"
"Again...amazing.......
so here's my rankings of the originals.
1. empire strikes back
2. THIS MOVIE (It is so good and shows Luke at his most powerful and most bad*ss stage of being a Jedi.)
3. new hope"
My favorite of all the SW movies
my favorite out of the whole franchise. lots of fun. Something for almost everyone to enjoy in this one.
"This film is an epic and satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. It expertly shows how our favorite hero's and villains have developed since we first met them. The only issues I have with the film lie in an odd series of choices with the story at Jaba's Palace, and the Ewoks. The space action is the best of the trilogy, and Luke and Vader's relationship is fascinating to watch."
Outstanding! Epic! Superb. Star Wars is ♥️♥️
"Not the perfect conclusion we'd be hoping for to the first Star Wars trilogy, but it's a lighter Star Wars than before, which is in keeping with the tone of this episode -- which is about the life-affirming stuff. As well, brilliant visual effects, new creature creations, and vivid new images to the Star Wars series, which includes a haughty Emperor, new settings, a mightily amusing gangster called Jabba the Hutt, and a matured Luke Skywalker who can handle Jabba's guards. And it is fun."
Great ending to the trilogy!
Return of the Jedi is a amazing movie has a very well written story lots of great effects exciting spaceship battles and blaster fights and its a much better ending to the Skywalker saga than that horrible Rise of Skywalker movie.
Luke I am your father!
"Great film, weakest in the trilogy. That's all. One word, EWOKS. When they show up, quality drastically declains."
It good but not better than any of the original 3 movies and could have finished off the saga better but it finished it up nice
Great end to the trilogy. Great movie as a kid and still fun as an adult.
A great finish to a great trilogy.
"I'm not one of those preachy fanboys who likes the original trilogy more JUST BECAUSE they're the original trilogy 

But I'm not ashamed to say that this IS my favourite Star Wars movie"
The teddy bears were a sign of the end of this franchise being good.
This movie is perfect.
A cinematic masterpiece and a great way to finish off the trilogy.
"The Director's chair of triquel went to the inexperienced Director Richard Marquand, and it catches the eye. In primarily suffered special effects - under increased in two times budget CGI looks worse than original movie, what cannot be said about effects practical - tens of darlings ewoks and dwellers caves Jabba the Hutt direct proof of. Because of the excessive detail of some scenes, there is a problem with the pace of the narrative, but all this is forgotten to hell, when half an hour later you plunge headlong into the very childishly bold action, for which we love the original trilogy of the franchise."
If it's the original DESPECIALISED edition it gets five stars but loses one for making the wookies into Ewoks. If it's the special edition it still loses a star because of that God awful dance scene so four stars.
"With the original trilogy coming to a close, this conclusion to the original saga doesn't quite as match the tone and quality as it's predecessors, but does deliver the familiar quality of special effects and character story arcs to make it a satisfying conclusion. Though a little bit slow at parts, it does showcase the great cast supporting the screen to keep you in a good mood~"
"THE REAL AND UNIQUE FINAL OF STAR WARS. A sentimental episode, nostalgic, endearing and sad to see the final game of Anakin Skywalker and true rise of his son Luke as the last Jedi master. Except for the Ewoks that are not up to a saga of this caliber, everything in Episode 6 is great."
"a great classic movie and a great end of the saga.
compared to the new star wars movies the plot ,characters and even the action scenes are much better."
"My second favorite Star Wars film. It was well done, highly suspenseful, and the film to cause me to love the franchise."
Great story. Timeless.
fantastic. if you love star wars you will love this.
"No, yes, and HELL YES! This movie is so much fun, a satisfying (yet not permanent) close to the series. A film with great moments and some of the best in the series with some mediocrity sprinkled on top to bring a great package as a whole. A true classic with one of coolest scenes in all of Star Wars makes this movie a must watch."
Sure its not better then the other two it is still a great film
"One of the best movies ever made, George Lucas was stupid and a genius by creating this franchise. I love it!"
"Close to perfect, with a fairly slow second act compared to the first and third. Still felt amazingly fresh after the first two, and ended the trilogy very well."
"Excellent film, hard to beat the originals."
"ROTJ was not that great. Easily the worst movie in  the original trilogy, the Endor parts of the movie REALLY dragged on and the Ewoks were unnecessary. I cannot complain about John Williams per usual, he is human perfection and cannot do wrong. Vader vs Luke was quite compelling and one of the best parts of the movie. Seeing Yoda again was refreshing. All of Han's characterization is seemingly erased from his memory from the events of the last movie."
Sadly the ewoks took it down a notch. but this is the clasic star wars11
The last great Star Wars movie.
My fav of the originals
One of my favorites.
"The true ending to the Skywalker Saga. It was great from beginning to end, the action was amazing and done well. All the characters shone in their own way."
"This is the REAL ending for the saga. The real wrap up for the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy too. Well written, well acted, beautifully shot, fun and exciting. Considering the year, this movie has aged very well throughout the decades. The music is awesome, meaningful and tense exactly where it needed to be. Spectacular climax. Definitely a must see."
Brilliant - it's easy.
Ewoks!!! Enough said’
"Aside from some silliness, this film delivers a satisfying, action-packed finally to Lucas's iconic trilogy."
"Nice, even tho Vader went insane."
"Great movie. And also, Ewoks."
The true ending of the Star Wars saga. Everything that came afterwards is just rich guys bad fan fiction.
"I absolutely LOVE this film. From the introduction of the mighty Jabba, to his downfall, to the true intro of Darth Sidious; I love the savage and adorable Ewoks and Luke in his prime is great to see. The Rancor beast is amazing and visually spectacular and the speeder bike chase rocks! The pacing is great and I love that the Death Star II fails miserably to gain any traction outside or blowing up a few rebel cruisers. It's hilarious to watch the Empire fail and lose and I enjoy the heroes winning! #MyFavStarWarsFlick"
Let's face it Ewoks are awesome! And the final battle is too!
"Nothing's perfect, kids. This movie sure ain't.
Perhaps it is here we see the problem that Star Wars and Empire had created. You can top one of them... but both? Possible, sure, but infeasible by mortal hands. So, what is a writer/director to do? Well, first off, ghost direct it so that you don't actually have to do the work, and secondly, just copy-paste a few bits from the first one.

Now, Star Wars has a very convenient but truly genuine excuse to recycle plot like this- The Force. Even in the first movie, lines of dialogue were identical, planets and people had similar names, and the structure of the film was circular to an extent. But even 36 years later, Return of the Jedi is a little to close to Star Wars for comfort, something that seems to be a returning problem in the franchise.

However, the opening act and closing final act are top-grade, essential Star Wars. The middle of the movie focuses mostly on Ewoks, and some non-consequential adventures with Han, which coupled with the return of the Death Star and Trench Run-esque sequence, really bog down what is one of the best climaxes to a trilogy ever.

In the end, Return of the Jedi is the first seriously flawed Star Wars film, but time has been kind to it, and today it is remembered alongside it's two sibling films as fondly as they are"
I can't even tell if this is a good movie or not. Yet a great story that completed the Original Trilogy.
"As a kid Return of the Jedi was my favourite Star Wars film. Why? Because it was a glorious end. In Star Wars we were introduced to all these amazing characters and they went on an adventure together. In Empire Strikes Back, they were separated and each suffered through their trials and tribulations. But in Return of the Jedi, they all come back together, they've grown as characters and as a group and go on one more adventure together to save the galaxy from the ultimate evil. Was the Tatooine part a bit weird? Certainly. But it was a nice call-back to the beginning of the saga and a great way to kick-start the action. Ewoks? I love them. As a kid I loved them and even as an adult I still love them. What, you don't think these small furry creatures should pose any danger to seasoned Stormtroopers? Judge me by my size do you? Well, you should not. RotJ brings about the most satisfying conclusion to the trilogy imaginable and I will leave it at that. I did not need anything after this, except for maybe a few additional fun adventures, which we got in the form of the Extended Universe and were fun enough to keep me entertained a little longer in this vast universe of stories and amazing characters."
"In my opinion, even better than Episode IV!"
"Muy buen final, lo de los Ewoks un poco exagerado pero eso no arruina todos los demás momentos emocionantes"
Of all the Starwars this is my favourite ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Return of the Jedi has put the conclusion to the original trilogy in good use. The screenplay is ok, the characters began to develop more, and the action sequences are better than ever. I love the creation of Jabba the Hut and the Ewoks. Not to mention the fantastic space battles. Overall, Return of the Jedi has put everything in place for the big finale between the Empire and the Rebels."
The second best film on the Star Wars saga of films. This movie made us all believe what it was to be a Jedi.
A wonderful end to a classic franchise.
Return Of The Jedi ends the original trilogy and truly all of them are the same amount of good of each other
"Great movie and should have been the end of the Skywalker saga, because it did it to perfection"
"This is my third favorite Star Wars film, behind Empire and Force Awakens. The first hour or so of this film, until they get off of Tattooine, is the greatest Star Wars film. The second hour, however, brings the entire movie down a peg. Once Luke, Han, and Leia get on Endor the movie is hurt by the inclusion of the Ewoks. 

Picture this, instead of having the final battle on Endor with the Ewoks, the movie could have the final battle of Kashyyyk with the Wookies. Make it a more action-packed and serious battle instead of a kiddy and goofy one. If the last hour of the movie played out like that, then it would be the best Star Wars film.

My Review: A-"
"A satisfying ending to a revolutionary trilogy. Lots of fun, brilliant visual effects and some fantastic story beats. It is the weakest of the original trilogy working more towards to kids movie than a space epic.
The beautifully constructed outline is sometimes buried beneath an overly quick and colourful atmosphere. However, there is enough there to call it a solidly entertaining conclusion."
"I don this movie
finalis in option  bad"
Really a good conclusion to the original trilogy
"Although its not the prefect Star Wars movie ever made, this is still a very entertaining  movie from beginning to end. Easily the best parts of the movie involve Darth Vader and Luke, every time they are on screen together, it brings the best out of both of them. When it comes to the storytelling it doesn't improve on Empire, it probably the weakest in the OT in every department. The beginning of the movie which involves Jabba's Palace is a good way to open a Star Wars movie.... however since George Lucas changed the OT in the special editions... in ROTJ it has the WORST changed that George Lucas ever did to the OT... adding the Jedi Rock song and seeing down a CGI creature throat when he's singing is just a embarrassment and really cringe... don't know why Lucas added that to this film. The CGI doesn't look good at times, especially when they are on Endor and on the speeders, the greenscreen behind the actors is so bad, it makes it less believable to watch. The Emperor has a strong presence throughout the film. Also I don't have a problem with the Ewoks being in this movie, at least they are more watchable than listening to Jar Jar Binks."
Teddy bears with spears beat advance scifi tanks...
Very good. Very entertaining and is fun.
Another one of the same threat.
This movie is the one i watched the most
"Return of the Jedi holds a special place in my heart. I know it's not the best Star Wars movie, but it's my favorite. The scenes with Luke and Vader steal the show!"
"The movie is very very well made, so fun to watch and holds up astonishingly well even without the 2000s edits.
The problem with this final chapter is that, for some bizarre reason, Lucas decided to ‘brand it' too much like a toy-selling machine: the battle of Endor is the perfect representation of a well thought context, with such a huge potential, which was ‘ruined' (in the sense that it just made it a little worse than it could be) by the Ewokes (or whatever they're called) screeching and ‘fighting' the Galactic Empires Army. I mean: the most powerful organization with almost limitless resources beaten by some furry creatures with sticks, ropes and stones? Come on.
I could also talk about the first scene of the movie and how ridiculous it is (except for the fight part) but it would take a lifetime.

What saved this movie? The duel between Luke and Vader, the redemption of Anakin Skywalker and the true nature of a bond between father and son. A truly powerful message that really hit me: I will never forget the final dialogue between Anakin and Luke."
I personally don't mind the Ewoks...
A fun conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy
The third movie in the franchise is the most thrilling of the series with a good plot and a lot of action. The storyline is very thorough and it gets to the point easily with some of the best scenes in the series. The ending is very satisfying with an amazing dramatic fight scene between Father and son. Return of the Jedi proves to be the best in my opinion because it shows the growth that Luke has made throughout the trilogy. The big problem that people have with these movies are the battle scenes with the Ewoks. I don't mind these scenes but some are extended and get boring to watch after a while.
!00% badass. they should have never made 7
The sixth episode of the Skywalker Saga finally ends the story of Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire!
"Great! I mean its not as good as ""A new hope"" Or ""Empire strikes back"" but still 9,5/10"
"Greatest sci-fi movie of all time.   Nothing has ever come close to this one, and I doubt anything ever will."
Perhaps the 3rd best sci-fi movie ever made.
"It's the weakest of the original trilogy, but Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is still an enormously fun action-adventure and a fitting and fantastic end to the trilogy.  Surprisingly thought-provoking, too, with great themes."
"i really liked this movie. It managed to have a good story, unlike the prequels."
A more than satisfactory conclusion to a legendary story. The movie does brush over some plot details. However it is full of brilliant moments and wraps the story of the series up beautifully.
Probably my favorite film of all time a long with The Empire Strikes Back.
I always remember being so exited watching this movie as a child. The Ewoks are so funny and lovable. Its a great family movie. This is my favourite Star Wars movie.
"Exciting and with a iconic fight, Return of the Jedi is both stunningly beautiful with a simple story and creatives some cringe moments."
"Everything on Tatooine, Hamill's performance, Han's jealousy, the heroes reuniting…it's wonderful adventure storytelling. Sure, people hate the Ewoks; they're wrong. People think it lacks emotional stakes; they're wrong. People think the final battle is lackluster; okay, they're kinda right about that. People say it's the worst of the original films; no question. Still, ""Jedi"" proves that this trilogy is so much better than the sum of its parts. Individually, each film is great; as a whole, they're legendary."
Return of the Jedi is a good ending to the original Star Wars Trilogy. Some scenes were powerful and might be considered the best in the entire franchise. I wouldn't say it is  as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back mainly because the film isn't as equally exciting. The beginning serves as continuation to Empire Strikes Back but no huge plot relevance. I would say this movie is very good but not amazing as the first two mainly because the movie isn't consistently amazing.
Star Wars: Return of the Jedi was amazing. This trilogy was great.
"The weakest of the original trilogy, but still a very good movie. Would like the Ewoks to do one, but other than that a very satisfying conclusion."
"In my opinion, this film wasn't as good as the past Star Wars."
great finish to the classic trilogy
"Often considered the weakest of the original trilogy eturn of the Jedi concludes the series with not so much as an explosion but with a thud. Its not a bad movie but it doesn't scale the heights that the previous two films scaled. The dark, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of The Empire Strikes Back is gone. Instead, for Return of the Jedi, we have good triumphing decisively over evil, a too-pat resolution to a love triangle, and walking teddy bears. Even Darth Vader doesn't seem very daunting this time around. With the arrival of the Emperor (a gaunt-looking Ian McDiarmid), Vader has turned into a second fiddle. It's decidedly unsatisfactory to watch him engage Luke in a civilized conversation. From a technical point-of-view, the space battles are amazing, easily dwarfing anything depicted in the previous films. Not only are there many, many more ships, but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved."
"Though failing to reach the cinematic heights of its predecessors, Return of the Jedi remains an entertaining sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy."
"While not being better than the movies before it ""The Return of the Jedi"" is to date one of the best Star Wars films. It delivers the emotional notes like the first two films and has by far the best action from beginning to end, with what's probably the best 3rd act out of any of the films. But it has it's weaknesses with the 2nd act really slowing down the movie with a slow pace and an oddly out of place yet exciting 1st act, 9/10."
The best conclusion to the only REAL trilogy of Star Wars.
"Such a great ending to a nearly perfect trilogy. They could have used less CGI though, seems like George Lucas was getting ready for the prequels."
An almost perfect ending to the trilogy.
"A classic ending and film, not as good as it's predecessors but still great"
Ewoks are the only thing holding back a 5/5.
My favorite of the original trilogy.
"This film is amazing. The end to a saga, and they delivered perfectly. The deaths of our two villains were great and respectful. A must watch."
This is one of the best movies around. Fun for all the family and really good acting. I find this episode a lot better than any of the new ones. Storyline is a lot better than the others. Phantom menace and clone wars are also garbage. Originals remastered all the way.
"A lot of epic , a dash of corny . Hella fun though ."
Great and classic movie.   Mark Hamill is great throughout.  One of the few films from the 70s that holds up.
"The ending is now irrelevant in Disney canon. Ehh who cares. Legends is better. Anyway, the perfect ending to the Skywalker Saga."
This is definitely one of my favorites! While not like Empire Strikes Back it’s still great! The Emperor is shown in person and even though he is a frail old man he is also very dangerous! Darth Vader also is really good as he is more emotional as he struggles between dark and light! This is the second great one after Empire Strikes Back! It’s far from the best though as there are so many other Star Wars movies like “Rogue One”! It is still very memorable and I love the Ewoks!
"Definitely the weakest of the Original Trilogy, mostly because of the Ewoks. Even still, some great moments with Luke and Vader make this a solid ending to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time."
"Here is where the cheese starts. It's at least a conclusion to the 2 great movies before it, but even as a kid I knew this was not as good as the first 2. It was the first of many times I left a theater watching this franchise feeling empty."
"People tend to give the last film of the original trilogy a hard time because of the Ewoks, though somewhat ridiculous it was always George Lucas' plan to have primitives fight the Empire. Its in the original rough draft for the first film. I never heard a complaint until I saw Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"". It still gives the thrills and spectacle fans are used to and concludes Luke Skywalker's story in an excellent way."
"So awesome! Vader's redemption is a powerful and iconic moment. Luke risking everything just because he sensed some good left in him, epic! A satisfying ending to an action packed trilogy."
"Though maybe not as evolving as its predecessor, Return of the Jedi remains an entertaining sci-fi adventure and a fitting end to the classic trilogy."
A good Star Wars Movie
A great finale for the middle of the Star Wars trilogy. I loved how the Ewoks were a surprising group of hero's that actually were instrumental in defeating the Empire. And really liked seeing how it was set in a forest. The movie did a great job of bringing the storyline together and tying up loose ends.
I like even the Ewoks
I feel calling this the worst of the trilogy is unfair - it should be seen as an equal to both A New Hope and Empire. It's still a near perfect film that gives you a more than worthy conclusion. The Empire is defeated and our heroes live happily ever after in the ultimate showdown of good vs evil.
"So many great things, some bad things. The Emperor is probably my favourite Star Wars villain, even above Darth Vader. He is such a screen presence, and ever scene he's in is great. There is the emotional (and fun) final battle between father and son. There is the Luke and Leia twist. And, finally, there's the final battle of Endor in both the forest and space. But there is also a slow and tedious first act to get through on Tatoonie. Still, great movie with great music, through not as good as the Empire Strikes Back"
"Insult to intelligence. Ewoks, Luke plan to save Han, No explanations why others join rebellion. Worst after empire of first 6"
"It falls short of the first two, but it's still a satisfying end to the classic trilogy."
"Return of the Jedi's emotional conclusion is a blissful reminder that the force is with us, always."
"A great conclusion to the saga, Mark Hamill, James Earl Jones and Ian McDiarmid all give great perormances. Ford and Fisher don't give performances on par with their previous installments and for the first time for Star Wars, toys weren't made for characters, characters were made for toys. Nonetheless, a great addition to the Star Wars saga. 8.5/10."
It's brilliant with a fantastic ending this is how a trilogy should end
"What a great ending to the fantastic Star Wars Original Trilogy. Luke Skywalker is at his best in this film, and Ian McDarmid is incredible as the Emperor. The space Battle of Endor is fast-paced and a joy to watch, Luke's lightsaber duel with Darth Vader is great, and Vader's redemption and death are some of the most emotional scenes in all of Star Wars. Yes, the Ewoks are bad creations by George Lucas, but those aside, this is a great Star Wars film, and my second favorite movie in the series, with The Empire Strikes Back being my favorite. A+ 98/100"
Best Origional trilogy star wars film!
A beautiful ending for a very well developed trilogy.
It does an effective job of closing off the trilogy.
Ewoks are kinda meh but great ending to a great saga
It's not as good as the two movies before it but still incredible. The ewoks might seem silly and ruin it for some.
"This was an awesome film that successfully ended the Original saga! This movie made Darth Vader's character one of the greatest characters in a movie! It had an amazing story and cashed in on the same character depth that was given to these characters in Empire Strikes Back! Despite a successfully story, I think this movie had some corny scenes in the beginning. The Ewoks fighting the Empire is very weird and probably shouldn't have been included. I think they should have had the Wookies fight the Storm Troopers. The movie was great but not without some flaws and some wired scenes. I think it does fail to live up to its predecessors but overall was still an amazing closer to the whole series and gave it a definitive ending!"
"The last film in the original Star Wars trilogy ends on a high note, and while it may not be the best in the trilogy. The film continues with more iconic moments like Jabba's Palace, the Ewoks, and Vader's Redemption. The acting and characters are both amazing and intimate. While some regard it as weak, I personally hold it in as much esteem as it's predecessors."
Excellent just watch the Original with the 90s CGI
I have always liked RotJ the least out of the original trilogy however that does not make it a bad movie it's just not as good as ANH or ESB.
"The end of the saga of the Skywalker. A true journey in terms of character development and story, where we learned to love and respect our protagonists. The emotion from the two previous movies is still there, while the story remains true to its foundation and world-building, it's a masterpiece!"
Best of the original trilogy.
"With two successful sci-fi adventure blockbusters, we were given Return of the Jedi, which gives a satisfying conclusion to this unforgettable trilogy!"
Although this movie is definitely the worst one of the original trilogy it is still worth watching. This movie drops the dark take that empire strikes back had and made it more child friendly by adding in the ewoks but still had it's dark and emotional moments such as when Luke and Vader have the end battle but decide to stop battling against eachother. Return of the jedi is definitely not as good as the original two but it is still a great film worth the watch with a great conclusion to the original trilogy 8/10
A heroic epic with high stakes deeply philosophical family drama at its core. A great conclusion of the trilogy.
This is my favorite Star Wars movie
"A stunning finish to an equally stunning trilogy. Though it reuses the original's final venture to destroy the Death Star, ROTJ will be remembered for being a good end to the space opera."
Lucasfilms took a step out of the more serious genre into the realm of camp with this last movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. The interesting characters and vast set pieces allowed for this to be overlooked. This is the beginning of the ‘Star Wars Formula' that would be used again in The Force Awakens.
The best Star Wars film ever made. Hamill is incredible and should have been nominated for an Oscar. The Jabba scenes and the ending scene in the throne room are some of the greatest scenes in the entire trilogy.
Not as good as the first two but still a mind blowing sci-fi adventure.
Luke is far dumber than in previous movies. His plan to save Han should enter into history as worst plan in long history of bad plans
bad ending to bad trilogy
If it weren't for the Ewoks this movie would be pe
A satisfying conclusion to an amazing trilogy.
"Ewoks, Jabba palace dumb rebel fleet that should lost etc..."
The best conlusion for the original trilogy
"Though as powerful as The Empire Strikes Back or impactful as A New Hope, Return of the Jedi still packs a punch."
"Re-watching this movie is very strange, this movie is very goofy and over the top."
An epic ending to the first saga of star wars.
"This is now the 20th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi and I'm sad to say that it didn't live up to the 1st two.

Star Wars: Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi is the 3rd Star Wars film to be released in cinemas and the 6th film in the Skywalker story line. The film was directed by Richard Marquand and stars Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Ian McDiarmid as Sheev Palpatine.

The acting in my opinion was just as good as the last two movies, but there were one or two scenes in which a couple of the actors felt a little off. 

The characters consist of some of the greatest from cinematic history, but also a couple characters who felt out of place. The original cast of characters were really strong, but some of the newer characters like the Ewoks didn't work for me.

The cinematography was strong with a few really good shots of the characters and scenery.

The settings were steady ranging from Tatooine to a new destination the Forest Moon of Endor.

The set designs and props were done really well from the building designs to the various weapons and machines.

The costume designs and makeup were also done really well especially with Darth Vader and the rest of the Galactic Empire.

The practical and special effects were very strong from the various puppets to the lighting effects.

The action I found was not as strong as the two previous films, but that's not to say that there wasn't any good action. The action for the most part was sound from the Ewoks fighting Stormtroopers to the various blaster battles, but I have to say that the final duel between light and darkness was great.

The music like almost all of the Star Wars films was really strong especially toward the end of the film.

The story may not be as strong as the last two films, but I still personally really enjoyed watching the story fold out.

The comedy was okay, but it didn't really work as well as it did with the last two films.

The film also had some strong atmosphere especially around the characters Darth Vader and Sheev Palpatine.

The film did also have some really iconic scenes like the end duel, and the battle on Tatooine.

I did have some complaints with the film like how they made it a lot more child friendly, but luckily it doesn't take away from the enjoyability of the film.

In my opinion the film is really enjoyable and something that I could watch again and again.

Over all I give it a
7/10
74%
3.7/5

Not as good as the 1st two, but still very strong"
"Granted, the first act in Jabba's Palace goes on for WAY too long, the effects are back to being dated, and there's too much cute emphasis on the Ewoks, Return of the Jedi is still a decent conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy, and has one of the best scenes in cinematic history with the final confrontation of Luke, Vader, and the Emperor."
This and revenge of the sith are the best by far
"I will say this is the weakest in the original Star Wars trilogy, but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's just the least perfect one."
A perfect ending to the trilogy and one of the best 3rth parts of all time
I love this movie very fun movie and with a good story 🤗
Nice Vietnam allegory but very silly and wacky more than interesting and groundbreaking.
"Episode VI is a solid conclusion to the Original Trilogy that expands upon the father son dynamic Luke and Vader share and further advances the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa. “Jedi” cements “Star Wars” as a children’s franchise, while still delivering serious moments sure to keep adults happy as well."
"This movie is awesome. The only reason it does not have five stars is because of a lot of time wasted with the Ewoks. The fight scenes with the Ewoks are also pretty silly. But other than that, it's very good with a satisfying ending."
Might not be as good as 4 or 5 but still 5 stars worthy!
Gives the saga an appropriate  ending. Humor ist at some points bad  and the overall feeling is not as in the movies prior.
"Maybe it's the worst movie of the original Star Wars trilogy, but it's still a 100% movie."
"Every time I think of an epic ending to a story, this is the first movie that pops into my head. Besides Return of the King, this movie hast the best ending in cinematographic history in my opinion. How appealing the characters are and the symbolism it has is just fantastic. Best sequel to its phenomenal predecessor."
Return of the Jedi is a cinematic treasure.
"Always used to love this movie, but it is kind of boring."
"Maybe the less powerful of all the original trilogy but for sure one of the best in the whole franchise. I remember watching this movie almost every week back in the day, when my older brother recorded it from TV. A classic and after all, a good ending for the long war against the Galactic Empire. The best moments: the whole scene in Tatooine with Jabba and Han's rescue, and the final battle with the death of the Emperor and Vader's redemption."
"Perfect conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Exciting, funny and an iconic part of my childhood."
incredible and perfect movie
"This movie is a massive disappointment in comparison to The Empire Strikes Back. As a movie in its own right. this movie is great. The storytelling, acting, and character development work very well. This movie is really emotionally satisfying. My biggest issues are the Ewoks and the pacing. Other than that, this movie is really good. Grade: B+"
I really loved this movie where it shows how Luke turned Vader back to the light.
Best of all star wars movies. The battle of Endor is just so epic.  Best music ever.
Un buon film; strega il fatto che riesca a commuovere un finale di una serie di fantascienza.. Sublime. Il tutto condito da un ottimo J. Williams. I parametri di giudizio sono tutti buoni. Voto: 8
Incredible way to end the Saga! Masterpiece.
This is by far my favorite Star Wars. Despite a lot of people hating the Endor scenes I loved them personally. A bunch of teddy bear with sticks and stones beating a bunch of well trained soldiers with lasers and explosives? Absurd but I loved it.
"While it isn't the best, this is my favorite Star Wars film. The scenes from the emperors throne room are fantastic. What a score!"
"For me this is the second best of the Star Wars saga and was my favorite as a kid.  The final showdown between Vader and Luke, Jabba's Palace, and the awesome space battle at the 2nd Death Star all make for a fantastic movie.  Also, count me as pro-Ewok!"
not as good as people like to think rated to high because of empire
"While it does show some signs of age, has a bit of a slow pace, and has a small short-term memory from its predecessor, RETURN OF THE JEDI is an immensely satisfying conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever constructed. The emotions REALLY get there, especially near the end of the film. The conflict between Luke, Darth, and Palpatine is incredible and written with unparalleled expertise. It is a bit more light-hearted, but it maintains the previous films' staples as a complex, energetic, quite beautiful, and a damn near solemn film on its own. DEFINITELY one of the best ""final-chapter"" films in any franchise."
"4,5/5 because ewoks."
Return of the Jedi is a great ending of the classic Star Wars trilogy.
"The Original Trilogy finale is a worthy romp back to a galaxy far, far away. This is a worthy follow-up The Empire Strikes Back and closes out the initial story in satisfying fashion."
"Maybe this should have been the last in the series, though I did enjoy Episodes 1 and 3."
Do not underestimate this timeless entertainment.
Jumped the sharl still good
"Third best movie of all time, right behind The Empire Strikes Back."
"Featuring some of the best action scenes in any of the Star Wars films, a great opening, and a climax that is action packed, emotionally powerful, intense, and provoking. Though some see Return of the Jedi as a step backwards, for me it concludes the trilogy in spectacular fashion."
"It was just epic, it showed a great story with the Jedi and diversity of aliens instead of POC politics.
Ewoks are just a cash grab toy sale though"
The Star Wars Saga comes to an emotional and Satisfying end for our heroes with a high note’ .
"Saw it in theaters. While not quite as good as the previous movies, the Ewocks were a little hard to take, it still wrapped up this series wonderfully and is a fine ending to the trilogy. Happy to watch this movie any time."
The best thrilling movie ever made!
"Even when I watch it with the special edition effects, it's still amazing. Don't get me wrong, the special edition with the added unnecessary effects was just horrible in all, but it didn't take away the childhoods that were made in the 2000s. In the end, it's a great movie to end off the best trilogy in Hollywood history."
"Watched it every year since it's release and it's still a pleasure. Great characters, great story, and some of the best scenes in Star Wars history. The only weak spot is one or two Ewok scenes in the middle, having said that the battle of Endor was still fun and credible."
pretty funny but the first i saw when i was 7 years old! A perfect one to start with as a kid
"Enjoyable and grand finale to the original trilogy. Has some weird plot choices though, especially towards the second and third acts."
"Wonderful movie, gave a good end to the Rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader.  Another classic."
Concluding one of the greatest trilogyâ(TM)s of all time. Return of the Jedi is on the same level as the two before this.
A classic. Top notch
A fitting conclusion to the trilogy! A must watch if you are a fan of Luke and Vader!
"Looking back, this is where this story should have ended cinematically. Excellent resolution to possibly the greatest fictional story of all time."
"Return of The Jedi From Rio De Janeiro... Incredibly perfect Cursive Mr. Carter...
Wonderful movie.. I did it with the R like Rakim.. As the earth gets further and further away planets as small balls of clay..
May the Force be with you.

I AM YOUR FATHER"
RETURN OF THE JEDI completes the riveting STAR WARS trilogy with a satisfying ending and another excellent movie.
Wow can we please give 6 Stars this movie has been such a big part of my life I love George Lucas and his vision and his desire to give us masterpieces like return of the Jedi.
A thrilling and action packed conclusion to the near flawless original trilogy.
"It retains the magic that helped make itâ(TM)s predecessors some of the best films ever made, but lacks the originality of Star Wars and the dark story of The Empire Strikes Back."
"Everyone seems to be a lot more mature in this film, it is probably my favorite out of the Original Trilogy. The story is good, and the acting is much better."
Star Wars at its peak
"Now that’s how you wrap up a story. Packed to the brim with outstanding visual effects and fantastic characters, Return of the Jedi remains an awesome albeit kinda silly (Ewoks) conclusion to the awesome Star Wars trilogy."
"i love this film, george lucas should never have sold star wars to disney, as much as i enjoy tfa  i think this is a true ending to the skywalker saga, george lucas' baby, anakin brught balance to the force when he destroyed darth sidious, there was peace in the galaxy as im writing this review, im thinking, as much as i like tfa its kind of unnecessary, anyways in this film , i can overlook someof the cgi shots cause its not as much as it is in phantom menace anyways this film is awesome and return of the jedi absofuckinglutely gets 5 out of 5 stars"
"Despite not being able to match the brilliance of its predecessors, ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" is still a well-written, action packed adventure that brings the original trilogy to an end perfectly."
"Great movie and great trilogy finale. One of the greatest trilogy finales ever and one of the few good trilogy finales, but this movie is still highly overrated and very flawed. It has a lot of problems. The pacing was so off, Han gets unfrozen too quickly, Luke's plan to rescue Leia and Han from Jabba was way too convoluted to be believable. The scenes with Jabba and the Ewoks were dumb, childish, weird, and cringey. I find it laughable how the Empire's army of elite troops were defeated by an army of little midget teddy bear-like creatures. It was ridiculous. It should have been an army of Wookies defeating the Empire's elite troops instead of those stupid Ewoks. That actually was originally going to happen, but George Lucas must've changed it to having Ewoks instead so he could earn more money since the Ewoks sell more toys to children than Wookies. Luke barely helped to defeat the Empire, he was mostly trying to bring Darth Vader back to the light side after figuring out that he really was his father. Lucas was too concerned about the money and selling toys than he was about the quality of the film. It was still a great movie but it still could have been SO MUCH BETTER. It had potential to be better than The Empire Strikes Back. Return of the Jedi could have been the greatest Star Wars movie, but it sadly wasn't. Overall, Return of the Jedi is a great, solid trilogy finale that is also a bit of a disappointment. 

Rating: 8/10"
"Great movie. Great ending, great dialogue and many more"
A fitting end to the legend of Luke Skywalker.
The most funniest ending to a much loved classic trilogy
"Slightly disappointing after the high of the previous entries in the saga, but perhaps it's only that way in comparison. Great end to the original trilogy, but something of the magic is lacking."
The most overrated Star Wars movie
"Star wars VI is the best of the 80's and star wars saga.

It's a old movie but the GFX and SFX are awesome.
In the movie the stormtroopers are very stupid and they can't aim propely.
The fights are impressive, the musics are beautiful but, but, but it's the loooonnngest movie I ever seen.
My favorite moment on the movie is the fight between Luke Skywalker  and Dark Vador (his father).

Finaly, it's great movie and I advise you to see this movie."
A great underated conclusion of the Star Wars movies. To me it delivers on every level except for some weird ewok stuff and a little bit of an inconsistant plot.
"While it is the weakest film of the original trilogy, it is still a great film, with outstanding performances by Hamill and McDiarmid especially."
Hopefully this saga will go on forever
"La degna conclusione di una delle più grandi trilogie della storia del cinema. Spettacolare, mozzafiato, ricco di azione e di momenti emozionanti, un vero gioiello, tanto quanto gli altri due film. Forse dei tre è il più difettoso, a causa dei famigerati Ewok, i quali però, sinceramente, con il tempo diventano sempre meno fastidiosi e risultano quasi simpatici. Insomma, non stiamo parlando certo di un Jar Jar Binks. Togliendo la terribile scena del numero musicale nel covo di Jabba, aggiunta nelle edizione restaurate del film e che sarebbe stato meglio non vedesse mai la luce, il film è davvero uno dei capitoli finali di trilogie più soddisfacenti di sempre. Magnifico."
"While a great story and movie overall, I cannot help but mention the Ewoks. A good 20 minutes of the movie was just plain boring. Other than that, it had one of the best endings of any movie series ever."
Satisfying and poignant final episode in a truly historic saga
Make Star Wars Great Again
It’s amazing how this movie holds up over time. This is the real Luke skywalker.
"Granted, the first act in Jabba's Palace goes on for WAY too long, the effects are back to being dated, and there's too much cute emphasis on the Ewoks, Return of the Jedi is still a decent conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy, and has one of the best scenes in cinematic history with the final confrontation of Luke, Vader, and the Emperor.

7/10"
"Not as strong as the other two of the original trilogy, but thankfully, it's still great."
A good Star Wars movie. Everyone should watch it at least once.
Weakest of the original trilogy in terms of originality. Still better than any Star Wars film that followed it.
"My favourite Star Wars film. Love it, must see."
This film is a fantastic end to a fantastic trilogy of films that focus around the fight between  good and evil. Now in this film more than ever it's about the bonds between friends and family. A tear jerking last visit to that galaxy far far away (well for a decade and a half)
What a satisfying finale to the original trilogy of the greatest franchise of all time.
Yet another amazing addition to the Star Wars saga: Return of the Jedi is everything a Star Wars movie should be.
The final piece to the puzzle that brings the story to a close. Film creates closure for the main character arcs and creates a sense of completion.
"And excellent, well crafted conclusion to a great trilogy of movies. Well paced, more of what I loved from the first two movies, worth watching just for the Jabba the Hutt puppet."
This was a great movie to end the first six and wishing it would of stopped their but still my favourite
"A satisfying, albeit lengthy movie."
While not as good as A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back it provides a fine conclusion to the original trilogy.
"The final movie of the original 3. Not as good as the first two but still a 5 star movie, loved the ewoks as a kid but not a fan as much as an adult but it's still acceptable."
A perfect ending the an amazing trilogy that delivers one of the best emotionally charged final fights in the history of cinema.
Best movie @ Brock K you dont want that kyle lowry smoke
"THE EWOKS SUCK!!!! AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE IS BORING AS HELL, THE ONLY THING THAT REDEEMS THIS MOVIE IS THE LAST 30 MINUTES WHICH ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD BUT THE FIRST HOUR AND A HALF SUCK."
"A very satisfying ending to the trilogy. Carrie Fischer’s golden bikini provided many you make fans a sexual awakening. She is gorgeous in it, and Luke’s final confrontation with Vader is excellent. The Ewoks could have been better and the acting disappoints at times with Hamill and even the usually stellar Ford, but this is really Vader’s film and his performance is excellent. We all wanted more after this and years later were forced to endure the prequel trilogy. Perhaps worse The Last Jedi which makes the ending of Return of the Jedi somewhat pointless."
"It's not Empire, its not Star Wars, but at the same time it is Star Wars. This is the third part of the greatest space opera of all time. It might fray a little at the edges, but Yub Nub brings it all home!"
Conner. Ni  Star Wars  maybe in
A truly amazing way to end the original Star Wars trilogy.
"A great conclusion for the original Star Wars trilogy, would have been perfect, but is unfortunately hindered by some pacing issues. Still a must-see."
Worst Star Wars movie
Good bad i think that jabba part Could be much greater
"A fitting end to the legendary saga, for balance has been brought to the force."
"seeing this in '83 blew everyone away in terms of FX alone. I was hooked by 'empire' and 'hope' already. im glad the audience score of over 1 million rates this at 94%. Could it be any better? Not for me.
The space battles and Endor scenes on the speeders are excellent. they really had honed the craft of making things look more realistic, with speed, distances and sizing of spaceships etc.
The story is great and answers all the questions i had and wraps up the mid section of the Star Wars Saga perfectly.
A Gem which i will always have a lot of love for and will return to again and again and again. Although if i see one i always have to see the whole lot. x"
"Return of the Jedi is a great conclusion to an epic trilogy that is slightly underrated. Not as great as the first two, but definitely worth the time. Bonus goes to Slave Leia in that bikini being chained by great puppetry of Jabba the Hutt."
I'm an original trilogy era person. Yet....ROTJ was a huge let down for me. One word....Ewoks.
"Though lighter than previous films, Return of the Jedi brings a satisfying conclusion and continues to have engaging characters and story"
Good but not as good as the first 2 but a great ending to the original trilogy.
Favorite of the trilogy
"The Return of the Jedi has some strong edges over some of its predecessors in certain way but the final battle ultimately feels like the same as The New Hope's final battle.
-7/10"
"Yes, great finish to the original trilogy"
an excellent end to a excellent trilligy
Despite some bad twists and ewoks this is still almost as good as emperor and has the best scene in the OT
"4/5.  It's not as good as the first two, due to the Ewoks and the poorly paced second act, but it starts strong and has a great finale and is a solid ending to the original trilogy."
Not a fan of the ewoks but still great star wars.
"Disappointing that they went for a lighter tone in this one, many opportunities for great character drama thrown aside for childish popcorn cinema tropes. The addition of a second Death Star is a boring retread but the character conflicts are still rich and overall it provides a satisfying conclusion in the places where it counts. Leia and Han's storyline is pretty lacking but Luke, Vader and Palpatine's is A+ level stuff."
"The force will be with the good portion of mankind within this movie, Always. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"Return of the Jedi is, indeed, the weakest of the original trilogy, but it's still brilliant anyway. The movie is a bit slow to start, unlike the exciting introductions we saw in the previous two entries. I could even argue that the whole Han Solo rescue sequence on-board the nefarious Jabba the Hutt's palace goes on too long, and isn't terribly interesting from a visual standpoint, but it manages to win us over with some inventive action sequences and some self-aware humor. The real excitement comes when the heroes are battling in space around the second Death Star(lead by Lando Calrissian) on the forest moon of Endor, and inside the Death Star itself. These story-lines intertwine and support each other, with actions from the surface affecting the space battle and what transpires when Luke confronts the evil Emperor and his father, Darth Vader. The latter sequence is one of the most emotional, and powerful of the entire series, as we see not Luke but Anakin Skywalker fulfill his destiny of stopping the Emperor and restoring balance to the Force. 

It isn't perfect, as the Ewoks probably weren't necessary and yet play a huge role in the climax (not to mention they grace the official movie poster), and some of the drama is a bit cheesy and heavy handed. Yet, it all feels just right, as we love and cherish these movies and the characters so much, we're willing to overlook occasional bumps and lapses in taste to enjoy a solid ending to one of the greatest film trilogies of all time."
"Not only my favorite of the original trilogy, but my favorite of all Star Wars media."
"The true end of the saga.  Redemption, love, family, and the epic struggle of light against dark."
"It must have been very hard for everyone at Lucasfilm to work on this film, because they had one of the toughest tasks in the history of cinema: living up to two masterpieces that had made people obsessed with the Star Wars universe. So I'm very thankful that they managed to pull this off. ""Return of the Jedi"" starts not too long after its predecessor ended, with Luke Skywalker in a mission to save his friends from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, using his still quite new Jedi powers. After dealing with Jabba, there is much more for the group to accomplish: that is to end the long lasting war between the Rebels and the Empire, by defeating Darth Vader and the Emperor. Luke is the one destined to do this, but the young Jedi Knight believes he can bring his father back to the good side and save him, alongside the rest of the galaxy. Concluding the simple yet emotionally complex storyline of the trilogy and finishing off several character arcs, ""Return of the Jedi"" is yet another balanced space adventure, packed with some really entertaining action sequences, a group of underrated animals and some truly powerful acting by its lead and supporting cast, consisting of Hamill, Ford, Fisher and more. The film ends this chapter of the Skywalker saga on a high note and John Williams with his breathtaking score surely contributes to that."
"My Favourite of the Series, it comes to a amazing finale"
Being able to see the Emperor as the puppet-master of the previous 2 movies (and even getting 3 precursors) is truly what makes this movie great! Very emotional and compelling!
Amazing fantasy set in space. The OT is still amazing. I never get tired of it.
The best space battle in the star wars saga epic
The movie had lots of action packed scene and great finale to the series.   some of the acting fell flat especially during the scene with luke telling princess leia that she is his sister.
"My personal favourite Star Wars entry! It has the largest cast of characters, and the greatest space battles of the original trilogy (I'm a sucker for a good space battle). The diversity of characters is one of my favourite parts about this movie and lots of new and interesting aliens are introduced. This trilogy shaped my formative years. I consumed all of the content that was available when I was 15 in no time at all, and continued to do so for 20 years thereafter.

It is far campier than the previous entry in particular, but all our heroes' efforts and growth have led to this, and bear fruit in this exciting final installment of the Star Wars saga! 

There are no other Star Wars movies after this one."
One of the best Star Wars movies that i love so much
Great finale to the originals ??
"This movie portrays Luke as a Jedi master, here we see how much he has matured! Han and Leia relationship is so cute and I love the Ewoks too! C3PO gets his king moment and R2 continues to Rock! We also witness the redemption of Vader! This movie is AWESOME!!!"
One of my favorites
"a must see star wars film, but watch  episodes 4 & 5 in orderly fashion first."
A great wrap up to the originals.
"Despite some flaws, it is a good conclusion to the OT."
"Wow, this movie could be a lot better if the kid freindliness had toned down after a very small amount of being dark and scary. The effects are good, nothing compared to the others, but makes up for the great climax and lightsaber fight, which is my favorite in the franchise. (Seriously, what was the purpose of the ewoks?)"
Amazing film has Ewoks and metal bikini for no reason.
Much better than the new movies.
Love it! There's no way Return Of The Jedi should be ranked below Episodes 7 and 8! I guess I'm old but for me nothing so far beats the original trilogy. Hopefully we'll get an official Blu-Ray theatrical version someday.
Wonderful and fun film that inspired generations of children to explore dci fi and always look for the good in people. Great characters that inspired excellent EU content! Must see!
"To be honest, this movie was the worst of the original trilogy. The pacing was pretty bad, and one of the only highlights of the whole thing is Darth Vader VS Luke at the end."
"Was part of the original trilogy abd thus gold, but was the weakest of the first three films with sub par graphics, acting, and story telling."
"The end of the originals and the beginning of George's big failure. Ewoks, jedi rocks and mostly less inovation. Nevertheless, Ian McDiarmid and B.D. Williams are shining and the last duel is one of the best in SW history. 4 1/2*"
Return of the Jedi is an insult to its two predecessors. A prime example of how the need to push for merchandise turns a film into a chaotic mess.
"I can't stand this film given that lucas took 5 films and crammed them into this one film, all because he was bored with star wars,"
Luke is back to bring peace but he will have to face Darth Vader as we know Vader is bad who is strong with the force will Vader all ways be on the dark side or will the tables turn! All ways remember that Quaigon said Annika will being balance to the force is it still true! Find out.
the redemption of anakin skywalker. classic lightsaber battle between luke and vader.  but ewoks besting stormtroopers? ewoks are just a blatant cuddly merchandising idea and insulting. otherwise a pretty good movie.
amazing movie has aged well
Some say it doesn't live up to A New Hope and I'm sure that this can be argued but for me it is a fantastic film with some truely epic moments. I will always remember the desperate want to see the next film that this perfectly created.
"I think they should have kept the old ending. If you're watching the saga with someone new, and you start at ""A new hope"" (order by release date), the ending is confusing to them."
This one really tried
Answered many questions. George told an amazing story. Thank You Mr. Lucas.
"If only the goofy intro scenes with Jabba were dumped, along with all the foolish ewok nonsense, this would rate much higher."
wow what a great movie! I WANT A EWOKE!!
"A fitting end to the original Star Wars trilogy, this movie is explorative and brings a balanced closing to the Saga. It may be challenging to overcome the amazingly done films of A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back, But Teturn of the Jedi manages to bring home the trilogy to a note where all movie-goers can enjoy."
Best SW movie IMO. Everything in this movie is a joy and everything is absolute class in this movie
Just perfect! If your picking holes in this film you're being picky!
one of my favorites.
The weakest of the original Star Wars
"Everyone has their favorite Star Wars and normally it's empire, but not me. This one was my favorite. I remember sneaking out of the movie my family was watching to see this playing. I got in trouble for doing it, but so worth it. I got to see the final scene with Luke fighting Darth Vader. This completes three part trilogy, i feel it has the best characterization of them, the story is great. It stumbled a bit in the beginning in the movie with Luke's plan to save Han, and I actually never liked the teddy bears in this somehow beating technology. But I still liked this one the best and always will. it has a warm place in my heart."
"One of my favorites because when I watched it as a kid I loved the Ewoks! Also a heartfelt ending to the best villain in film history, Darth Vader! Seeing Luke as a Jedi was precious!"
A great finish to the trilogy not as strong as the first two before it but a good solid finish opening decades of joy in Novelizations and more.
"As an adult I realise how silly the Ewoks are, but as a child I loved this movie. And I think it is truly timeless."
"Loved it as a kid. As an adult, I realized that it's a bit stupid. But, I still love it."
"a good ending. and where they should have stopped the timeline. Anakin brings balance to the force, Luke becomes the Knight he was born to be, Han and Leia end up together. Everything tied up in a nice little bow"
"Great ending to the Saga of Anakin Skywalker, Aliens, Lore, Action, Adventure, Heart Warming, Love, Depth and a Happy Ending you won't believe....."
"A great film to end off the Original Trilogy, although I would've loved to see Luke turn to the dark side like it was originally going to be."
"Satisfying end in the trilogy,not as good as Empire but still enjoyable"
"In contrast to the stark stability of its predecessors, ""Return of the Jedi"" is a rollercoaster of ecstasy-inducing highs and dishearteningly miserable lows. Fortunately, the film is never derailed too far off track and survives long enough to deliver an epic ending that will forever remain one of the great moments in cinematic history."
"While it may not be as refined as the other 2 films, Return of the Jedi still manages to deliver a thrilling and emotionally impactful conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy."
"""Return of the Jedi"" is a fitting conclusion to the original Star Wars Trilogy."
4 stars bc the ewoks were supposed to be wookies buy Lucas started going crazy by this point and thought wookies would be to scary for kids & ewoks would appeal more.
Best ending to a trilogy ever
"While this film doesn't come close to The Empire Strikes back, it certainly gives us an exciting and thrilling end to an amazing sequel. The Return of the Jedi gives an amazing conclusion to the infamous original trilogy."
"I love this film, it's a great end to the franchise...and I mean to the franchise, because the new sequels are not part of the same history, they have almost no connection to the other six films.  The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are just reboots labeled as sequels."
"Ewoks and belching jokes. Why God? Why? Could of been better ,could of been worse"
Great movie which would have scored more if Chewie barbecued an ewok...
The third greatest fantasy film of all time.
"Another great Star Wars movie. Not my personal favorite SW film of all time, probably my 1st or 2nd most disliked. Nothing major wrong with the film, more of a personal preference. I believe many different routes could of been taken to end the story. To many this is their favorite, and I have no problem with that. In the end it is a just and good end to the Star Wars saga. Rating: 4/5 82%"
Great movie with some classic and great scenes. Amazing conclusion to the series
epic final of a legends
This is my all time favorite Star Wars film. This film is a masterpiece.
my second favorite star wars film.
"Good, but not great. Some of the character moments and special effects are on par with New Hope and Empire. The beginning and end are extremely well done, but the Ewoks are very annoying and some elements show flaws, however Return of the Jedi is still a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy,"
good but i dont like teddybears
"A great ending to the original trilogy. In my opinion, the first 30-40 minutes is the best moment of the whole Star Wars franchise."
"The weakest link in the original trilogy and never reaches as many heights as its predecessors, however it is still a very entertaining film and the finale is one of the best parts of the entire trilogy."
"Return of the Jedi has been near to my heart since its release in 1983. It has the best scene to date in the entire suite of eight episodes. With the release of the missed opportunity concerning the treatment of Luke in The Last Jedi, this is movie has now replaced Empire as the best of them all. This is as close as we get to seeing Luke in his prime."
"My personal second favorite Star Wars movie, but probably the weakest of the original trilogy. The first portion of the movie serves to establish Luke as a now very capable Jedi Knight, and the scenes on The Death Star with Vader, The Emperor and Luke remain as some of the best the entire franchise has to offer. the score is the best in the entire saga (I'll also take ""Victory Theme"" over ""Yub-Nub"" any day) and while it has problems with its tone sometimes and some slower parts, it's a fantastic finale to the story, and where my personal head canon ends."
As good as the first two no. Still makes me feel good yes oh yes.
An exception to my opinion the 3rds the worst. A tie with episode seven for my favorite Star Wars film
"Return of the Jedi brings a slightly more light-hearted  presence with the Ewoks and all, but still brings back the compelling story from it's predecessors."
What can I say? It's Star Wars!
"The only movie in the orginal trilogy that isn't widely regarded as a masterpiece, and for good reasons. The opening act in Jaba palace, while incredibly athmospheric and creative, was a complete mess of a storytelling. Who wrote that? It almost felt like the script was improvised. The whole deal with Ewoks and battle for Endor was a waste of time for the most part. The only worthwhile part of the movie is the final act with Luke, Vader and Emperor on the Death Star 2.0. And no, i'm not giving them a free pass for rehashing the Death Star, it was bad when TFA did that, so it's bad here too. Overall, i can't say the saga ended on a high note, but unfortunately, it just went downhill from there."
Darth Vader dies. Master Yoda dies. Jabba dies. Lots of death. I love Star Wars.
"Misses the dizzy heights of Empire but still a wonderful film. it was always my favourite growing up the final battle is just magical, in space and on endor. Vader's redemption stunning to watch"
"Although not quite as versatile as its predecessors, it's still a magical sci-fi picture with epic scenes, that balances our favorite characters perfectly, while being an appropriate conclusion to this legendary trilogy altogether."
"The end of the trilogy, and a great conclusion (till Disney fucked it up)"
"Not as good as it's predecessors, but still a good finish to an amazing trilogy."
"Luke looks a like a good jedi appreantice, the actions are a little slow, some times looks very patethic how the ewoks beat the stormtroopers, Anakin sounds and looks different to the one of the episodes I to III, it was just a good movie"
A great finale.  Who knew it was actually the start of a new generation of films a new decades later!
The title speaks for its self.  Legendary. I say no more.
"Awful! Really horribly terrible. Poor timing, long winded, over dramatic, rubbish actions scenes, Just awful!  Only kudos goes to special affects team."
"This Film has A Way too long opening, a sillier tone than Empire and a bunch of small little CREATURES that gRind this film to hAult and is DEFINITELY the weakest out of the original trilogy.  Having said that, it's still a fun adventure with some cool sequences and fitting character arcs that culminates in a great finale and conclusion to a series that helped this movie appear way better than it actually is."
"I know this isn’t the best Star Wars movie, but it’s the one I most enjoy watching."
"Though slightly weaker than its two predecessors, Return of the Jedi gives a satisfying and quality conclusion to the most iconic trilogy in film history."
In my opinion it is about as good as a new hope. Same formula but has great special effects (NON CG VERSION OF IT) of jaba the hutt and all the other aliens.
A great conclusion to an amazing saga.
One Of The Best Sci Fi Movies Ever Made
"Return of the Jedi is not as iconic as A New Hope or the masterpiece that The Empire Strikes Back is, but does a very good job at wrapping up the trilogy while introducing fresh and creative editions to the existing universe."
this was one of my least Favorited episodes but thats only because the rest were better i actually liked this movie the ewoks were cute Han was a bad-ass Luke was interesting and that slave leia scene was hot  i think they put that on the cover to attract boy fans but that scene made we want to watch this movie over and over
"Return Of The Jedi is a fun final installment to the masterfully crafted trilogy...yet manages to be the worst of the 3 films. It's still a great movie, but Episode IV and V demolish it compared to writing and storytelling.
 I'll give it 
         - 84%"
Fucking Ewoks. Besides those little fuckers its a great movie.
Great ending only ruined by some campiness.
"A satisfying conclusion to the 'Star Wars' trilogy, it may have failed to live up to previous instalments however with more action and an involving plot, 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' still lives up to expectations. This film deserves 92%."
A great conclusion to an amazing saga.
"A strong finish to the trilogy, but ultimately one that can only do so much. Setting the bulk of the film on Endor does provide a nice change of scenery, but it's also a gamble. As an adult, I didn't find the Ewoks all that endearing, though I may have if I had first seen the film as a child. All the major characters get well-rounded endings."
"One of my favorite movies and one of the best Star Wars movie in my opinion Luke Skywalker was the best in this movie I loved how he used to be a farmer and now he gets his own green lightsaber, Han Solo wasn't as good as the last two movies Princess Leia was great, My favorite scene is the fight between Luke and Darth Vader and this movie proves that Anakin is the chosen one, The Ewoks were great and cute of course the story was great too. This is one of my favorite Star Wars movie it is a great movie."

"A great "" Star Wars "" movie.  Had everything you can want in a great adventure space fable.  A classic close to the "" Luke & Leia "" trilogy."
"My favorite in the series. Simple as that. The throne room scene is cinematic perfection. The movie series for me ends here from 1-6. Post George Lucas filmography is bad fan fiction made by amateurs who not only tossed out Lucas' own story treatments, but also think that good visuals and comedy = a great movie. Not cool. Thank you George Lucas for giving us something truly special over so many years!"
"In my opinion this is the worst of the three original movies, but is still truly epic.  If you have not seen this movie, you are doing yourself a disservice.  The final confrontation between Luke and Vader is beyond amazing; one of the most memorable scenes in movie history.  ""Take your weapon, strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey toward the dark side will be COMPLETE!"""
"I feel the finale to the original trilogy is underrated. Yes it does feel more like a kids movie with the ewoks but I don't mind them. They are cute and fuzzy and were probably only their to sell toys, but at least they aren't as annoying as Jar Jar Binks (thank god). This movie is just as good as the original and it takes the saga in new directions. It has the best space battle of the original trilogy and arguably the most emotional lightsaber fight in the entire saga. The cast is once again great as they all maintain the charm the had in the first two movies. The finale to this trilogy is what closed out the greatest movie trilogy of all time and ending the saga on a high not (until the prequels)."
This Used To Be My Favourite Star Wars Movie When I Was Little!!
Jabba the Hutt died too easily.
"George Lucas has done it again!
Apart from the irrelevant and confusing 'Jedi Rocks' scene in the film, this is another classic final Star Wars chapter in the Original Trilogy yet.
There's a sweet part in the end where Darth Vader has a change of heart, and I think the Ewoks are weird but cute characters (despite the fact that they don't speak English).
The film has a cool storyline with the original classic characters, except that I find Jabba The Hutt really annoying, as if he's speaking an alien language in slow motion.
Otherwise - great film!"
My favorite part is Luke fights Darth Vader and we get to see the emperor choose your destiny
"My personal favorite amongst Star Wars movies, simply awesome !  A classic !"
"Despite falling through in a few places (namely the death of Boba Fett and the Ewoks), Return of the Jedi provides us with the same great main cast, the same great special effects, and the same compelling action that we got from its predecessors, delivering a great finale to the Star Wars trilogy."
"An interesting change of scenery, best moment is the battle between Luke and Vader and end of the Emperor. Lots of fun throughout."
"Clearly establishes the dichotomy of good and evil in the Force.  The young Jedi mistakes himself for a Knight, plays it loose with the Dark Side and kills a giant space slug crime boss where his sister falls in love with a scoundrel who's frozen in suspended animation.  They all escape and travel to a forested moon to fight the galaxy's most nefarious Force Wizard (I mean, who put that guy in charge?).  The prodigal son is chased around by his cybernetic father who dogs the young Jedi until the father chucks his lightsaber and threatens to convert the young Jedi's sister.  The Jedi gives into his anger, cuts off his father's hand and is complemented and encouraged by the Wizard.  The Jedi holds to his heart, and the Wizard fries him with purple lightning, who is then killed by his most ruthless right-hand-man.  Meanwhile the Wizard's troops are overcome by a wookie and a tribe of savage man-eating teddy bears.  Then they blow up the SECOND Death Star.  I mean, I guess if you have the resources to build a second one ... .  Celebrations break out across the galaxy (in an extended edition).  And they all [almost] live happily ever after [or would have if the fans hadn't demanded more movies]."
"This is my 3rd least favorite Star Wars movie. Return of the Jedi even though its not as good as the first two it still is one of my favorite movies of all time and it is an amazing conclusion to the original trilogy. This one adds the fantastically adorable ewoks and the end of the reign of Darth Vader. The visuals effects are gorgeous just as they were in the other two. The animatronics and puppets continue to be fantastic especially Yoda and R2-D2. The acting especially from Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Billy Dee Williams was stupendous. Frank Oz's voice over performance was great. The musical score was amazing."
This was my favorite movie as a kid. As an adult I like Empire more but this movie still features the best space battle ever put to film.
The great conclusion to one of the most beloved story lines of all time.
"A very satisfying ending to a classic trilogy. Love the action, the humor, and the originality. Wonderfully entertaining movie."
I love these original Star Wars movies and the last one was made the same year I was born so I guess they new I was a Jedi and I was returning!!
"The most forgettable film of the original trilogy, but such criticism is relative. When the competition is near perfection, greatness still only takes the bronze."
"Return of the Jedi might sag a bit in the middle with the Ewoks and all, but the beginning and end are amazing.  Acting and soundtrack remain amazing, new locations like Endor are all great, yada yada yada.  But where this movie really shines in my opinion is Darth Vader's redemption to the light side of the force.  Luke is filled with so much compassion for his father that he defies the Emperor time and time again in order to redeem him, and even when it seems like Luke's fate is sealed, Vader valiantly turns to kills the Emperor in order to save his son.  When Luke removes Vader's mask and they exchange arguably the most heartfelt and emotional dialogue in the saga, I cried for the first time during a Star Wars film. Overall RotJ is a satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy, and despite its flaws I can't bear to give it less than five stars because the ending is just so damn good."
"This movie offers a fitting end to what may be the best movie trilogy of all time, and an entertaining one at that. Finally, we see the Emperor of the galaxy and he is an absolute manipulative badass. Luke and Vader in this movie are great, with both trying to turn each other to their side and then leading to an emotional duel (my favorite in the series) that closes the trilogy and redeems Anakin Skywalker. The movie also offers a glimpse at the... stranger side of the galaxy with Jabba's palace in the beginning. It is filled top to bottom with unique aliens that show the depth of the Star Wars galaxy. Jabba himself is an absolute masterpiece, being the most complex practical creature in the entire Star Wars universe and just overall entertaining. All of our beloved characters from the previous two movies are back again and offer amazing performances and shine in this movie. The one downside I can even think of are the ewoks, and I frankly don't mind them. Also, some of the blue screen is outdated unfortunately but that does not detract from the epic experience that is ""Return of the Jedi."" In the end, this movie is an adventurous, entertaining, beautiful end to what is the original trilogy of Star Wars and will go down in history as a marvel of cinema."
Best Star Wars movie ever made
"As the saga draws to a close, we see Luke rise to become a Jedi, and the fall of Darth Vader. Sticks and stones may break the bones of the empire, as the old Ewok saying goes... quite literally. Who is the Emperor anyway?"
500 times better than the last Jedi.
The first half of the film is fantastic and the end is epic but it gets a little bit mehh in the middle... especially with the ewoks
Ewoks are cool. I love Ewoks.
Not better than the first two. This is more like a kids movie with burp jokes and slapstick. But the action and writing (not the Ewoks) are good.
"Remove the Ewoks, and you will have some serious sh!t"
"I liked it when I was a kid for the Ewoks. Watching it again as an adult, it kind of dragged and the Ewoks look like they smell bad and wouldn't want one near me."
"Another very good film with a lot of great moments. The movie can get a little silly at times especially towards the end of the film but still, it's fun to watch."
"A superb conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies made.

Perfect conclusion of the Hero's Journey, of Luke Skywalker, and an intriguing quest to save a father, where a son still sees a sliver of hope of redemption, and lulls the little spark there is to life.

A space battle conclusion which is satisfied, although one might still today wonder how the Executor Destroyer could go down just because it's bridge went poof, and the Ewoks being a bit much, but still keeping it within the universe of death and sacrifice.

Luke's character was the most important progressions in this one, and one may even compare him to religious statue at the end, as he more or less becomes enlightened, in a sense of Buddhism.

A shame Disney went on to completely ruin the legacy of Star Wars in The Last Jedi."
Must see in its original theatrical cut as restored by Harmy in the Despecialized Edition.
Another great Star Wars film. You may have to cut the volume during the musical part in Jabba's Palace & the Ewoks are a little annoying but Return of the Jedi is the perfect END to the saga. Especially since Disney can't make Star Wars films without screwing it up.
A great finale to a great Saga.
"This film veers from the more adult and sombre tone of it's predecessor ""Empire"", and returns to it's roots as a children's adventure film. 

Overall, a satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy for the main protagonist's story arc, and another exciting adventure with the band of unlikely friends we have so come to love."
I give this a 95/A+.
Classic. Simply the Best.
Amazing ending to the best movie trilogy every created! This is where the Star Wars saga should have ended.
"5>4>6>>7>R1>3>1>2>>>8
After the dark Empire Strikes back, the whole Ewok Stuff doesnt really fit in  an otherwise excellent movie."
Fantastic ending to this trilogy.
"A heartfelt end to the original trilogy, marred by middling filler in the second and third acts."
A bit silly with those fluffy bears; some ppl like the (i do not). Lame how the defeated the troopers when they cannot even walk.  Nonetheless it was a good film.
"I feel as if this movie deserves to be the 2nd best of the Original Trilogy, ahead of Empire Strikes Back, but behind A New Hope. Fitting way to complete the OT and keep you on your toes throughout its entirety."
"After the excellence that was The Empire Strikes Back, this installment seems to jump the shark a bit in a few places.

It spends perhaps a bit too much time with the Ewoks. We could have seen other areas of character development, instead.

The dramatic ending with the Emperor, as many have pointed out, seems a little anti-climactic given his impressive power. Could have been done much better.

Overall a solid installment, however."
The second best movie of the series
The greatest film and finish to a character arc of all time.
Okay the ewoks suck sometimes but this is a fantastic finish of a great trilogy although.
"The last film in the original trilogy, it continued the amazing plot and characters. I didn't like Ewoks though, they really didn't sit well with me for everything they did. Other than that it was great."
A rip roaring space adventure with thrills all the way.
"My least favorite of the Lucas live action movies. I really only like the Luke story line. Not a fan of the Ewoks, though I kind of liked them as a kid."
"eh. The third act was one of the best, but the rest, eh. Ewoks are okay, but eh. The worst of the trilogy, but it was nowhere near bad."
"Star Wars - Return Of The Jedi is a fantastic movie to an amazing original trilogy! The plot is so much fun, the visuals are amazing as usual & the characters & the new ones are so much fun! I'm just amazed that I'm a Star Wars fan :)"
"""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" comes full circle to wrap up the original saga, and it does so in style. While the movie suffers many issues, mostly with pacing and the whole Ewok segment in the second act, the ending does proof that the sixth entry (at the time was the third) is a powerful and memorable one. All the characters continue to develop correctly as they're face with challenging obstacles that give shape to the overall story. The acting this time was the best out of the entire original trilogy. Every cast member (including Jabba The Hutt if you want) played his or her part professionally and handled their roles profoundly. The third act is pure sci-fi beauty. The space battle remains to this day one of the most iconic. And the whole throne room scene is pure brilliance; the emotional weight surrounding it is what really takes the scene to another level. We also get to see Vader's journey come to a very beautiful, peaceful end as he realizes what value he is missing: Family, which is a central theme throughout the movie."
Was awesome right up until the Ewoks. Everything else is so powerful and exciting. A great finale to an amazing Trilogy.
A great conclusion to the trilogy.
"Return of the Jedi isn't necessarily the conclusion to Star Wars saga everyone wanted, but it is perhaps the one we needed.

I've always loved the beginning of the film -- Jabba's Palace. We see each member of the main cast slowly introduced, with Luke being the last. The film does a great job of showing us that Luke has advanced in his training, while making him seem mysterious. The characters are definitely Return of the Jedi's strongest suit. The relationship between Luke and Leia is emphasized, but like in The Empire Strikes Back, I found the moments between Luke and the Jedi and Sith of the film to be the best.

The film seems to slow down to a crawl in its second act with Ewok escapades. Ultimately, I don't mind the Ewoks too much nor their theme of nature triumphing over the Empire's technology, but we could've had less moments of their village and more moments with Vader a la Empire. The scenes with the Rebel Alliance are great as well. Billy Dee Williams does a great job as Lando Calrissian while Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb add some much-needed non humans to the rebellion.

The third act of the film, as is the norm with Star Wars, is absolutely spectacular. The space and ground parts of the Battle of Endor are equally engaging and tense. Though the use of another Death Star seems repetitive, I feel that it was the best decision they could've done and it increased the stakes of the battle. Luke, Vader, and Palpatine's confrontation on the Death Star itself is one of the best moments in Star Wars history. The raw emotion and question of whether Luke will turn or not was masterfully done. The final ending celebration was great as well.

As the last installment of the original Star Wars trilogy, Return of the Jedi is a great conclusion and gets too much hate. It has its flaws, but is a worthy end to the saga."
"One of the best ways to the original series. Though I was not a fan of the ewoks it is still very enjoyable. If you haven't seen it I compel you to watch this original trilogy. However do not watch the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi) if you don't want to sour the taste of star wars."
"Return of the Jedi successfully brings George Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy to a satisfying conclusion, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights that A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back hit. It does most of the things that made everything those first two movies so great, however it's still not perfect. For me, I think what brings it down slightly is that it feels like it's rushing to tie up loose ends. I'm not referring to the redemption of Darth Vader, the death of the Emperor, or the completion of Luke's heroic journey (all of which are handled masterfully). I'm mainly referring to the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt. Granted, it is a fun first act of the movie, but I can't help be feel like it was done as a ""let's hurry up and tie up this cliffhanger from Episode V"" type of thing. Like I said, it's well done and entertaining as hell, but in a few ways it almost feels out of place, especially when you consider the sequence is never mentioned again after that first act. It nearly feels like two separate movies. Additionally, the ending (where all of our heroes seem to live happily ever after) seems to be played safe, seeming to show that Lucas really did want to be done with Star Wars at the time. Despite all of the time I've put into that, those really are minor gripes for me. It is hard not to love this movie. All the praise I've written about the previous two installments of the trilogy - the cast, characters, effects, story - all still apply here. Lucas crafted a fitting end to his trilogy that has endured and been beloved for so long (yes, Lucas didn't direct, but you can feel more of his stamp on the film than director Richard Marquand). Ultimately, any film fan (not just Star Wars fan) worth their weight needs to make sure they've seen Return of the Jedi if they haven't already."
"One of the best Star Wars movies.  I understand people don't like the ewoks (I mostly agree), but at least they had a point to the story.  The story progression, the character development, the world building, and the visuals were all amazing in this movie.  I can't believe something made this long ago can be so much better in every way than the garbage like the Last Jedi they are creating now.  I don't think anyone in charge of making the Last Jedi ever really watched this movie.  Luke is the man in the return of the Jedi.  He went on a suicide mission to save his father in the deathstar because he could sense good in him.  How does that line up with how they portrayed him in the Last Jedi?  At least we can go and rewatch these great originals and wipe the Last Jedi from our minds."
"While this was the weakest of the three originals, Jedi is still a great film, and a wonderful satisfying wrap making the trilogy one of the best movie sagas of all time.  Without question this is a great film, with a great finish, edge of your seat suspense and by now we are familiar with the star wars formula that Lucas utilized, the film itself is the third part of a three part story, it has the familiar action packed start on the barge, the saving of Solo, and moves into its own third part with the ultimate showdown between Luke, Vader and the Emperor, and the Rebels and Imperial showdown on Endor.  Yes, the ending of what Harrison Ford called a ""teddy bear"" party is a little goofy, but many are endeared to the ewoks, it is easy to parody ""empire taken down by space bears"" but the nature vs technology, and the little guy vs the big bully is just a classic end to a great saga."
"While not as investing or cinematic enough as its predecessors, 'Return of the Jedi' finishes what 'A New Hope' started with a damn entertaining, albeit flawed, conclusion."
"Solid conclusion to an epic trilogy. Wished they had thought of a different threat than another Death Star, but it was handled pretty differently than the first time around. More of the same great wit and characters. Fun story and great space battle. Good final confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader."
"This is an enjoyable, decent movie. Unlike the last Jedi, which is complete garbage trash."
"Return of the Jedi may not be as good as the previous two, but it's still pretty great."
"Although this is the weakest of the originals, its still an entertaining ending to one of the greatest film trilogies ever! The characters continue so develop grow and the story is intriguing and deep. Despite a couple of minor things that i did't like (Ewoks)  the overall film satisfied me none the less. 

Final Score 8/10"
"This is where the Star Wars saga started to faulter, not with The Phantom Menace. The Ewoks were the precursor to Jar Jar Binks. Trying to finish all the story arcs set up in the last two movies made the story seem rushed. The implausibility of the rebellion defeating the empire within a year of being totally crushed was too unrealistic. Still there are some great action sequences and the scene at the end with Luke, Vader and the Emperor was great. The space Battle against the Imperial fleet and the second Death Star is the best of the series."
Classic and my favorite Star Wars movie!
Some silliness that drags on in act 2 can't hold down the amazing opening and closing sequences which deliver some of the best entertainment in film history in the rescue at Jabba's palace and the destruction of the second death star
"Abit sillier but still fun, emotional, well done, amazing finale
MASTERPIECE"
great finale to a great trilogy
"There are Ewoks - get over it. 
Leia is in a bakini - don't be a perv. 
They did another Death Star - get used it it. 
This movie is great, the music is haunting, the lightsaber battle at the end is amazing. This is ROTJ folks! It's freaking incredible."
A fitting conclusion to a wonderful trilogy. Never quite matches up to its predecessors but gives action and fun in spades.
A fitting conclusion to the hero's journey. With Ewoks.
"This movie retains the amazing characters and gives an epic conclusion to the star wars story. Only problem is the Ewoks, they kinda stop the progress of the movie at times and almost delegitimize the Empire as a threat, however looking past that this movie has next to no issues."
Return of the last jedi.
Ewoks walk the line of cloying nuisances but they 'man'-up fight the good fight. Good story and a solid ending assuming you aren't watching the ridiculous Special Editions.
"ROTJ caps off a lackluster bunch of movies. There are three shuttle landings b/w the end of ESB and intro to ROTJ. One of them was for a decrepit cackling Halloween prop. Are they just lazy? They blew up a space slug among other reject props from Sesame Street just prior. So.. that was disgusting. Should've cut the carbonite scene in ESB and cut the Tatooine scenes entirely. They didn't add to the grossly thin plot. Watching a Rogue One sequence as filler would've been preferrable.

The rebel assault on the death star was the only real passable scene. It's fun to watch, opposed to teddy bears running around like idiots and a smug brat fake-fighting a pale old geezer on his last legs, while we listen to a giggling effeminate prune in the background.

They did the death star and rebel armada battle pretty well, and so it's worthy of 1 star. Though even that is another re-hashed plot. It's the ending to this disturbing set of movies, so I'll give it extra points for that. Meh."
"Not quite as good as 4 and 5, ‘Return’ ends one of the greatest movie trilogies on a high note. Side bar: I’m a major sucker for the Ewoks."
A great finale to a great trilogy
"Puntaje Original: 7.5

"A flawed movie, and far too silly in places (Boba Fett going out like Wile E. Coyote, belch jokes everywhere, and so on), but otherwise a menacing thrill ride and a gripping end to the character arcs of the original trilogy. Not ""must see"" level, but still a rewarding experience."
Still a great film with some flaws. Easily overlooked and still breathtaking to this day. The Star Wars we know and loved.
"The worst of the Trilogy, Return of the Jedi still has enough to offer despite its stagnant pacing and less intriguing action sequences. This film is its best with Skywalker and Vader’s conflict and proves to be an extremely powerful and moving moment in the entire franchise."
The best Star Wars ever made and it always will be.
"Ending the original trilogy of the jaw dropping, plot twisting franchise known as Star Wars this is a powerful and great movie. It provides great performances from all actors and the ending provides a great twist provided but the terrifying, but surprisingly likable Darth Vader. This is not as good as A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back, but is a great solid movie, that you should watch."
"No sé que puedo decir de esta película, aparte que marcó mi infancia junto con las otras dos. Un desenlace perfecto para una gran trilogía."
not as good as 5 but good
Great conclusion to the saga.
"The conclusion to the original trilogy delivered in every way, It feels like the Saga is closed. Even though it isn't as good as Empire Strikes Back Return of the Jedi is still a great movie."
its okay not as good as 5
"This a fantastic movie. Although it does fall short of the Empire Strikes Back and the original Star Wars, it is still a great movie. Even though the Ewoks are forced and have no place, they have something to do and aren't completely annoying. The characters, from Han Solo to Darth Vader, all are just as fantastic as they were in the Empire Strikes Back. The pacing drags in the middle somewhat, but every part with the Emperor, Luke, and Vader is fantastic. None of the characters are wasted, except Boba Fett. It is still a fantastic movie all around."
Great movie but just too much Ewoks
"The Saga is Complete - or Is It?

The final chapter of the original trilogy may not be as strong as Empire but is still a damn lot of fun. The characters, especially Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are even more interesting in this film and all the loose ends from the previous two films are tied up in a satisfying bow.

One year after Empire, Luke launches a Han Solo rescue plan with all the heroes playing a role.  They enter Jabba the Hutt's palace, trying to trick him into releasing Han. But that plan goes wrong after freeing Han, when the droids are captured, Leia is reduced to bikini wearing slave girl, and Chewie and Han are thrown in jail. Luke comes in but he almost falls victim to a monster who he kills, but is aslo captured. Luke and Han are sentenced to death by being thrown into a giant sand pit monster. However Luke has outwitted Jabba and the entire group of heroes escapes and Luke has the pleasure of killing every last bad guy, with a choking assist from Leia and Han's accidental killing of Boba Fett.  

Luke goes back to Dagobah with R2 only to find out Yoda is dying of old age. Before he dies, Yoda confesses that Vader is indeed his father and that there is another Skywalker but does not reveal who it is. Obi Wan appears and Luke senses that the other Skywalker is Leia.

The heroes rejoin the rebellion to learn that a second Death Star is being built. The plan is to attack the new Death Star only after the shield generator on the nearby forest moon is destroyed. The heroes go to the moon to destroy the shield generator while Lando joins the Death Star assault piloting the Millennium Falcon. In the forest, the heroes confront the Empire and chase them on speeder bikes. Leia is separated from the group but she meets s teddy bear type creature and joins them. When the other search for her, they are captured by the rest of the teddy bears and almost eaten. Luke saves them all. In a quiet moment Luke tells Leia that she is his sister.

The attack on the Death Star is doomed to fail because the Emperor has planned to capture and kill the heroes on the moon and destroy the fleet. Darth Vader goes to capture Luke and take him to the Emperor. When the battle commences it is plain the Death Star is operational. Back on the moon, the remaining heroes enlist the help of the Teddy bears.  Only with their help is the shield generator taken down and the attack on the half built Death Star begins. Vader attacks Luke who gives away that Leia is his sister and Vader's daughter.  When Vader threatens to turn his sister to the Dark Side, Luke snaps and cuts Vader's hand off. The Emperor then tempts Luke to join him and replace Vader - which Luke rejects. Palpatine then tries to kill him but Vader lifts the Emperor and throws him headlong down the reactor shaft, suffering fatal injuries in the process. He dies in Luke's arms. Lando blows up the second Death Star and the battle is won. Back on Endor, Leia tells Han that she is a Skywalker too. Luke burns Vader's body. As the entire galaxy celebrates, Luke sees his mentors and his father as force ghosts and smiles. 
This is Luke's movie as much as Empire was Han's movie. He's never been more of a badass than in this movie. He looks great too with his black clothes and green lightsaber. Han Solo is cruising in this movie, but retains his charming rogue personality.  It might have been better if was killed off in this one, but who would not want to see the elder Solo in the Force Awakens. Leia is developed more - she kills Jabba with relish and his convincing on the speeder bikes and her scenes with Luke. Lando, Chewie and droids all play their roles well, bringing a smile when required. Of course, one of the most memorable turns is from Mon Calamari, Admiral Ackbar.

Darth Vader turns to be not such a bad guy after all and James Earl Jones delivers his usual great performance. But the star of the show is Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor. He wreaks of evil and is balances some of the silly Ewok moments with some chilling lines and acting. His death scene is one the key moment of the saga. Jabba is great in the flesh, and besides Yoda, the best puppet in the saga.

This is not as well directed as the last film but has the benefit of a Lawrence Kasdan script to the Lucas story. The music is the best in the original trilogy. It features ground-breaking effects, especially in the speeder bike sequence and the space battle.

A few problems too - Obi Wan's 'certain point of view' statement is weak. The Ewoks are silly but not as silly as what is to come later. Their section drags a bit and slows everything down. In the special editions, some of the changes were good, others were awful. The Yub Nub song was replaced - thank God. The Sarlaac pit was upgraded and Hayden Christensen's force ghost wraps up everything very well - once you've seen Episodes 1-3.  Some bad points  - the Jedi rocks number is indefensible as is the addition of two more Vader NOOOOs in the climactic scene. And who wants to see Gungans celebrating at the end?

Overall, Return is a great conclusion to the original trilogy and still hold up to this day. George Lucas made my childhood with this final film.

Luke goes back to Dagobah with R2 only to find out Yoda is dying of old age. Before he dies, Yoda confesses that Vader is indeed his father and that there is another Skywalker but does not reveal who it is. Obi Wan appears and Luke senses that the other Skywalker is Leia.

The heroes rejoin the rebellion to learn that a second Death Star is being built. The plan is to attack the new Death Star only after the shield generator on the nearby forest moon is destroyed. The heroes go to the moon to destroy the shield generator while Lando joins the Death Star assault piloting the Millennium Falcon. In the forest, the heroes confront the Empire and chase them on speeder bikes. Leia is separated from the group but she meets s teddy bear type creature and joins them. When the other search for her, they are captured by the rest of the teddy bears and almost eaten. Luke saves them all. In a quiet moment Luke tells Leia that she is his sister.

The attack on the Death Star is doomed to fail because the Emperor has planned to capture and kill the heroes on the moon and destroy the fleet. Darth Vader goes to capture Luke and take him to the Emperor. When the battle commences it is plain the Death Star is operational. Back on the moon, the remaining heroes enlist the help of the Teddy bears.  Only with their help is the shield generator taken down and the attack on the half built Death Star begins. Vader attacks Luke who gives away that Leia is his sister and Vader's daughter.  When Vader threatens to turn his sister to the Dark Side, Luke snaps and cuts Vader's hand off. The Emperor then tempts Luke to join him and replace Vader - which Luke rejects. Palpatine then tries to kill him but Vader lifts the Emperor and throws him headlong down the reactor shaft, suffering fatal injuries in the process. He dies in Luke's arms. Lando blows up the second Death Star and the battle is won. Back on Endor, Leia tells Han that she is a Skywalker too. Luke burns Vader's body. As the entire galaxy celebrates, Luke sees his mentors and his father as force ghosts and smiles. 
This is Luke's movie as much as Empire was Han's movie. He's never been more of a badass than in this movie. He looks great too with his black clothes and green lightsaber. Han Solo is cruising in this movie, but retains his charming rogue personality.  It might have been better if was killed off in this one, but who would not want to see the elder Solo in the Force Awakens. Leia is developed more - she kills Jabba with relish and his convincing on the speeder bikes and her scenes with Luke. Lando, Chewie and droids all play their roles well, bringing a smile when required. Of course, one of the most memorable turns is from Mon Calamari, Admiral Ackbar.

Darth Vader turns to be not such a bad guy after all and James Earl Jones delivers his usual great performance. But the star of the show is Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor. He wreaks of evil and is balances some of the silly Ewok moments with some chilling lines and acting. His death scene is one the key moment of the saga. Jabba is great in the flesh, and besides Yoda, the best puppet in the saga.

This is not as well directed as the last film but has the benefit of a Lawrence Kasdan script to the Lucas story. The music is the best in the original trilogy. It features ground-breaking effects, especially in the speeder bike sequence and the space battle.

A few problems too - Obi Wan's 'certain point of view' statement is weak. The Ewoks are silly but not as silly as what is to come later. Their section drags a bit and slows everything down. In the special editions, some of the changes were good, others were awful. The Yub Nub song was replaced - thank God. The Sarlaac pit was upgraded and Hayden Christensen's force ghost wraps up everything very well - once you've seen Episodes 1-3.  Some bad points  - the Jedi rocks number is indefensible as is the addition of two more Vader NOOOOs in the climactic scene. And who wants to see Gungans celebrating at the end?

Overall, Return is a great conclusion to the original trilogy and still hold up to this day. George Lucas made my childhood with this final film.


The Saga is Complete - or Is It?

The final chapter of the original trilogy may not be as strong as Empire but is still a damn lot of fun. The characters, especially Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are even more interesting in this film and all the loose ends from the previous two films are tied up in a satisfying bow.

One year after Empire, Luke launches a Han Solo rescue plan with all the heroes playing a role.  They enter Jabba the Hutt's palace, trying to trick him into releasing Han. But that plan goes wrong after freeing Han, when the droids are captured, Leia is reduced to bikini wearing slave girl, and Chewie and Han are thrown in jail. Luke comes in but he almost falls victim to a monster who he kills, but is aslo captured. Luke and Han are sentenced to death by being thrown into a giant sand pit monster.

Overall, Return is a great conclusion to the original trilogy and still hold up to this day. George Lucas made my childhood with this final film."
"Such a great conclusion to the original trilogy. Except from the annoying Ewoks, everything else was great."
"not as great as 4 and 5, but still spectacular. My only complaints are the ewoks and second death star."
"Possibly my favorite movie, definitely my favorite Star Wars movie."
A good close to the first Trilogy. Overambitious and disappointing at times but otherwise a fun movie that does justice to the overall trilogy.
"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) - 9/10
Acting - 8/10
Sound/Music - 8/10
Film Storyline - 7/10
Trilogy Continuity - 8/10

Overall - 8/10

The end of the Original Trilogy.  An inspiring film that showed the climax of amazing characters and the story we watched them tell."
"Great beginning, but Ewoks destroyed whole movie."
Possibly my favourite movie of all time.
"4.5/5.0 Great and Emotional Ending, with some flaws that could have been better and fixed with reshoots or rewrites ( Boba F, some parts of act 1)"
Great movie probably the best star wars film.
Fantastic and satifactory conclusion with deeper character focus
"Even though the final act is a bit overstuffed (something the prequels would come to continue) and the over reliance on muppeteers in the opening become wearisome, the film is still. A great capper to an excellent trilogy."
Great! Absolutely wonderful! Great way to close of the series!
"Return of the Jedi is a spectacular, yet flawed, conclusion to the Original Trilogy. Though considered by many as being weaker than its predecessors, Return of the Jedi maintains its composure and leaves us with a fitting, natural end to the Original Trilogy. Luke is now a Jedi Knight and must prove his worth by once again battling Darth Vader. The movie features amazing sequences (Battle above Sarlacc pit, speeder bike chase on Endor, the Death Star II battle, final lightsaber duel) and also features one of the most ridiculous moments in the Star Wars films: Ewoks (teddy bears) managing to defeat Stormtroopers and AT-STs. However, the final battle between Darth Vader and Luke is a super emotional moment. Luke subdues Vader and realizes he will fall to the Dark Side if he strikes down Vader. The Emperor electrocutes Luke, and in one of the most shocking moments of the Star Wars saga, Vader grabs the Emperor and hurls him down the Death Star II's reactor shaft, killing him. Vader has his helmet removed and is revealed to be a frail, old man full of regret for all of the bad deeds he has done under the Emperor's rule. This moment is very emotional and perfectly humanizes Darth Vader. This movie is a fitting conclusion to the Original Trilogy and deserves much more credit."
"A much better installment in comparison to the original two films in my opinion. CGI was greatly improved, the acting wasn't horrible, and the climax was more rewarding."
"Capping the original trilogy was a tall task after the success of the first two films. This film did it right, with a gloriously exhilarating thrill ride. It gets bookended by two great action sequences. I loved the opening scenes, picking right up where the cliffhanger of Empire ends. The action at Jabba the Hutt's made for arguably the most exciting start to any Star Wars, including the later films. Combine that with the battle of Endor and Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker II and you've got a tremendous start and finish to this installment. Like Empire, this had several big plot moments, including Luke and Leia being revealed as twins, as well as more great performances.

There are several issues that keep it from reaching the levels of the first two films. The Yoda/Luke scene and the early Endor sequences both seem to drag on a bit. I also understand the gripes I've heard with the Ewoks being a little too cartoony. I get it. Return of the Jedi more than makes up for it with Vader's redemption story. They waited just long enough to pull the trigger that you think it might not happen. When it finally does, it feels earned. I also found Han Solo's evolution to hero, while still remaining a scoundrel, to be great. The score was one again one of the best pieces of the film, as John Williams continued to be an unheralded hero of the saga. All in all, while it has flaws that prevent it from being an all-time classic, it remains a fitting conclusion to the original trilogy."
villain dead i repeat villain dead.........................no more sequels
"The conclusion to what is possibly the greatest movie trilogy of all time could not have ended on a higher note. Some of the film's elements may seem sillier than its predecessors (ie: Ewoks), but it never stops the film from delivering where it counts. Each character arc reaches a climactic and satisfying end, and the emotions could not feel more sincere. As always, there is plenty of boisterous action, particularly in a grand escape in the first act, and a high-speed chase on the forest-moon of 'Endor.' Although Jabba's Palace is undoubtedly the highlight of the film, the final confrontation between Luke and Vader is grippingly effective. Special praise should also go to the newly revealed evil mastermind behind all of the darkness, who leaves a lasting impression on the saga. 'Jedi' is an exciting and genuinely moving finale, that left fans wanting more for what could possibly be until the end of time."
"Return of the Jedi is a fine conclusion to the Original Trilogy Star Wars films with maybe some bumps along the way. The Battle of Endor at the end of the film remains, on a technical front, one of the most impressive displays of practical effects in cinema."
"Return of the Jedi is a fine conclusion to the Original Trilogy Star Wars films with maybe some bumps along the way. The Battle of Endor at the end of the film remains, on a technical front, one of the most impressive displays of practical effects in cinema."
Got a little cartoonish with the Ewoks. Still a great conclusion to the original three
"Not as great as the first two, but it's still great."
"Although this movie has some flaws, this movie serves as a great conclusion to an epic trilogy."
This is my favorite  movie of all time
An epic and satisfactory conclusion.
"The last movie of the Original trilogy creates a satisfying conclusion to the movie. Yet, it still leaves unanswered questions to the characters and the Star Wars universe. This phenomenon creates a huge Star Wars base and the works in trying to expand the Universe beyond the movies (until Disney's acquisition of Lucasarts that is)."
"While it may be the weakest in the trilogy, it still ends on a high note."
"(86/100)
The Original Trilogy..."
a very fun star wars movie just a masterpiece
"Not as good as the others, but still a great film."
loved it the second best in the whole series but the third act is so well done better than all of the other ones matches with star wars return of the sith
"I actually found Luke's conversation with Anakin at the end to be the  most moving part of the entire saga. I have no doubt that many pre-internet films get a nostalgia bump and thats certainly true of these films. Still, even purely for its historic value, these films are worth watching."
It was a awesome STAR WARS film. It is an epic conclusion. However it takes forever to start. Still awesome.
Not as good as the last two but it's still awesome.
"Star Wars return of the Jedi is still in action packed with good fights and Luck is finally a Jedi so he is ready to face Darth Vader but Luke will need people""s help to destroy the Death Star now find out if that will happen, choose your side whether you're with Vader or Luke"
"It has some flaws, but it's a really fun action adventure film."
"One of my favorable series from the whole trilogy of Star Wars. Return of the Jedi comes with a variety which occurs in a lot of changes, from the director, staffs, tones, and stories. This movie seems like a movie which basically felt dark and psychological like the one in The Empire Strikes Back to be a not-too-promising movie. The introduction of a new character, Luke who is no longer an innocent child, one of the promising climax scene, and ""it is a trap."" The subplots such as the Ewoks and Boba Fett are indeed the promising ones, for me. But, I just didn't know why Boba Fett was turned off in this movie and people really hated the Ewoks. Return of the Jedi comes out with a little disappointment but a very brilliant visual effect doesn't change the possibility that this is one of the series that I likes best."
The Force is strong with George Lucas! And really good music by John Williams :)
AWESOME. BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME
Star Wars is my favorite movie series of all time and this is my favorite Star Wars movie! The special affects are so good and the story is amazing and expertly written by George Lucas! My favorite actor Harrison Ford does a great job with my favorite Star Wars character Han Solo and it's a must watch!
"Return of the Jedi was amazing but it left a plot hole, how did Luke get his light saber?"
Entertaining and fun. George Lucas hasn't disappointed us yet. Well not till the prequels.
"A solid conclusion to the original trilogy. It is almost flawless with the exception of the ewoks. Nonetheless, I recommend this movie to everyone."
A perfect conclusion to a perfect trilogy.
"Not a big fan of this movie at all, as I do feel the action was not really good quality, and was stretched out over more than an hour of film. I thought the ending was predictable, the acting and dialogue was cheesy, and compared to the previous 2 instalments in the franchise, a bit of a shame. I feel like this is an overrated film. I'm sorry, I do"
"Never before or after this film will a trilogy not only make three great movies, but they also get better as they go. 

This fight scene at the end still holds up. A land, space, and lightsaber battle all happening at once. My mind still can't even handle it. FU Empire!

Go to broforcesquad.com to check us out, and don't listen to Admiral Ackbar when he tells you ""IT'S A TRAP!!"""
Return of the Jedi is emotionally intense and brings about tears for those who have watched prequels to see the finale of this saga.
While It has ewoks and plot wholes it is an epic conclusion to the triolgy.
A very good movie interesting and fun but the ending is weak and the beginning is the best part most people remember this movie for leia in her metal slave bikini not for much else
"A satisfying conclusion to one of the best movie trilogies of all time. It is not as good as its predecessors, but only by a little. Many people don't like this film, and I struggle to see why. I have only a couple problems with this movie:
1. The Ewoks. They were there to sell toys and make two bad made-for-TV specials. Their victory over the the technologically advanced Empire is absolutely ridiculous. If the Ewoks were Wookies, I may have bought it.
2. Death Star II. It's too repetitive of A New Hope and it doesn't make any sense that the Empire would make another one of these.
That's it though. The final duel between Luke and Vader is fantastic, the visual effects are phenomenal, and the acting is superb. Overall, while not the best of the original trilogy, it is VERY close to living up to the two that came before it. A near perfect film, and a wonderful conclusion. Watch it now."
"Although not as good as the first 2, Jedi still maintains the adventure and excitement of the first movies. A fitting conclusion to a great trilogy.
Some of the characters and visual effects do not quite hold up as strongly as the first 2, but the film still managers to deliver some very memorable lines, scenes and characters. Even though it does not have the same sense of grandeur there's enough action and a sense of conclusion that will keep you gripped to your seats till the very end.
Ps: the kids will love this one!"
"Easily the weakest of the originals.  It suffers from pandering to merchandise and the cutesy and very annoying Ewoks,  but it's still a fun and entertaining closing to the original trilogy."
"A satisfying finale of the Star Wars originals. Not as great as A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back, yet still good Star Wars flick."
This is still a good film although quite underwhelming compared to the masterpiece that was Empire Strikes Back.
It was the final chapter of my favourite movie trilogy and the saddest part is Darth Vader (spoiler) at the end
"8/10  Return of the Jedi is deep and dark, but it's also lots of fun, if a bit derivative. But the main thing that takes away from my enjoyment of the movie is Ewoks. I hate Ewoks."
I'm sorry but I'm going to keep passing out a full 5 stars until it actually gets bad...
My second favorite Star Wars film in the original trilogy.
This is my favourite so far I think 8 will beat it my second favourite is 7
"While at times a little uneven, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is a thoroughly entertaining and fitting end to a space adventure unlike any other."
Star Wars Return Of The Jedi: Dumber and slower than the rest of the original predecessor's. Star Wars The Return of The Jedi is a weak and dissapointing end to the original series.
A terrific and satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy.
"The epic conclusion to the original trilogy adds lots of imagination to the Star Wars universe, but will mostly appeal to actual Star Wars fans than your average movie viewer."
"Not as great as the first two but still it was a good ending to the original trilogy.

8.5/10"
"Never understood why people disliked this movie. Growing up this was my favorite movie in the franchise. Great characters, many locations, space battles, and those lovable ewoks. The scene were luke helps his father   to the shuttle gets me everytime. Do not know what gets me the most, the love for his father or the fact i''ll never see vader again. The movie may be said to be geared more towards children but i liked being a kid more than an adult."
"Almost as good as the first two. It is however more for kids. The ewoks were not cute, and the story was slightly worse."
"RotJ gets a bad rap for the OT.  It's pretty much unwarranted.  Where in this film is there really a flaw?  The Ewoks?  That seems to be everyone's gripe.  What's wrong with the Ewoks?  It's a primitive species that overcomes the technologically advanced Empire.  That is the idea of Hope which is what Star Wars seems to be all about.  If anything, the film should be taking a hit from the slow paced opening set in Jabba's Palace and Sail Barge.
There isn't much Lightsaber play in this film and what there is, is pretty slow, but no one can deny that the last few seconds of the Luke/Vader duel is the most powerful saber battle of all the Star Wars films."
Good movie.Not as good the the fifth one tho
The Jedi has returned of the Force :)
"While a slight let-down in comparison to the groundbreaking 1977 classic and the smash hit sequel The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi still boasts enough of what fans of the franchise have come to expect. This thus makes Return of the Jedi a satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. The Ewoks were perhaps a ploy to sell toys but I'd still prefer being stuck in a room with them over a certain possibly racist Gungan. Once again, some fine performances, amazing action and a slightly emotional scene when the film is almost about to end. As I said beforehand, a satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. Now I'll get out my magic sanity juice to help me survive the prequel trilogy...and that Star Wars cartoon which was a theatrically released pilot episode released in 2008 as well, I guess. Life can be a pain in the ass, sometimes, you know?"
"This film works as a solid conclusion to the story as a whole. However, as a stand alone film, Return Of The Jedi unfortunately isn't as emotionally involving as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back."
"A satisfying conclusion to one of the great trilogies of cinema, The Return of the Jedi doesn't hold the punch that Empire Strikes Back does, but is still excellent, genre-defining science fiction."
Stay away from the prequels !
"While not quite as good as 'The Empire Strikes Back', this third installment provides a satisfying finale to this fantasy epic. The story does meander at times and the beginning at Jabba's Palace feels like a completely different movie from the second half. It is also hard to believe there was an outline for how the trilogy would turn out from the start. The Luke-Leia sibling twist seems to come out of nowhere and makes all their on-the-lips kissing scenes weird. If Lucas had planned this from the start then that is even more weird. Also Yoda keeps flip-flopping on whether or not Luke has completed his training. That said, 'Return of the Jedi' works as a conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy."
fair if somewhat derivative Star Wars sequel in which Luke confronts the Emperor and Darth Vader and another death star is destroyed. It makes for entertaining viewing until the Ewoks make an appearance. The armoured and futuristically equipped imperial stormtroopers are apparently totally ineffective against stone-age teddy bears that struggle to clamber over a two foot obstacle. Really the most egregious example of a flaw that runs through the whole series; suspense is not generated because the Empire is just too incompetent to pose a believable threat.
"A fantastic conclusion to the original trilogy, even if it isn't a perfect movie. All ends are tied up in a good explosive and emotional fashion, and despite its shortcomings, Episode VI is a great conclusion to the legendary original trilogy."
"Again, another Star Wars film that is as good as the original. Lots of interesting characters."
"A strong closer, but not as charming as the first two."
Lost half a STAR for the Ewoks
A amazing film of this amazing franchise.
"Richard Marquand may had not made a movie as good as Irvin Kershner or George Lucas, but ""Return of the Jedi"" was anyway an excellent end for the trilogy. Every character arc is completed and it's very well done. It isn't perfect, maybe the Ewoks had too much time in the story and the tribe scene wasn't necessary. With another adjustments in the script we could have here a perfect third installment, but it isn't disappointing."
"Funny and childish, Return of the jedi is an ok final chapter of of the best trilogies in cinema-"
Really good Star Wars film. I could've not used the ewoks though.
"It's not as good as the first two, but it's fantastic in its own right, and the Ewoks are adorable."
Loved the whole film especially the special edition when it has hayden at the end
Good ending for an awesome saga
"The weakest of the original trilogy, but still a great film nonetheless. The struggle that Luke displays between the light and the dark sides of the force is fascinating. Everyone on this Earth struggles with doing the right thing and Luke shows this multiplied by 100, with so much riding on his decisions. I can't recommend that you start your journey into Star Wars with this film. However, you should definitely take this thrill ride at some point during your Star Wars journey."
"Not as good as the first two parts in this trilogy.  This one introduces many of the problems that George Lucas expanded on in the prequel trilogy and made star wars a bit lame.  

It has some of the best scenes from any star wars movie (some great highs), but also some of the most lame (some big lows)."
Return of jedi was a great film I like this the best star wars film.
"This is the movie that put the button on the most popular series of films ever made.  Some people hate the Ewoks, among some other flaws, but it was always my personal favorite as a youngster and the space battle near the end really keeps you hooked in."
"Though 'Return of the Jedi' is not the best film in the series, it's still a satisfying end of a fantastic sci-fi trilogy."
"The third part of the Star Wars Saga is the same level of quality than the previous two parts. Sometimes it is so that the old-sufficient, and it is displayed here when the most stunning continue to Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones (as well as even Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi Alec Guinness). Effects are of high quality and spinning in the background while the orcs are just as strange in appearance. George Lucas is with Lawrence Kasdan once again done a great job. 
Based on such displays in the Star Wars movies remain at the top of sci-fi movies. I must also thank one of the Star Wars films in absolute stars Carrie Fisher, who surprisingly left among us a little less than three months ago. 
The same fate experienced by Fisher's mother Debbie Reynolds in a little while after her daughter passed away. Rest in peace!"
This one was better than the others.
"The movie was great, but it would've been better if Jabba the Hutt wasn't a major character in the first part and the Ehawks weren't so annoying.  But I enjoyed the final fight between Luke and Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine."
"Unfortunately this movie isn't as good as the last two films. The opening scene is awesome, but then the characters don't really have anything else to do for the rest of the movie when the get Han back. Then there is the ewoks taking down an army of fully armed stormed troopers which makes the storm troopers look even more pathetic. It's unfortunate but compared to Episode 5 this movie falls flat to me."
"""RETURN OF THE JEDI"" adalah sebuah penutup yang sangat tepat. ... ""May the force be with you, all."""
This is my favorite Movie ever! Just the way it is directed makes me love this movie more than The Empire Strikes Back. It is edited very very well for its time 1983. The story ended great and no Star Wars movies where made until the Prequels.
"Not as good as the first two because of Ewoks, but fantastic conclusion."
Action packed blockbuster. Does not dissapoint
"While maybe not living up to the excellence of The Empire Strikes back, Return of The Jedi is a Star Wars installment worth noting, with its epic Starfighter battle scenes and it's epic final duel."
Probably the most classic movie of all time
"My favorite Star Wars movie! This movie has some great action scenes and a great storyline! I love this movie, and is my favorite movie of all time!!!"
"It's good, mean come on it's Star Wars. But it is one of my least favorite as far as Star Wars goes. It just looses me."
"It's  a good movie, but it feels a little too cheery compared to the rest of the original films. There's also the elephant in the room, duping a tribe of teddy bears into thinking you're angry deities is some how a heartwarming experience."
"Good. But not great. All the stuff with Jabba the hut I like, and all the stuff with sky walker and Vader I found very good. But the eWoks is just dumb and took me out of the film a bit"
"Even if it doesn't reach the same level as the last two, it is still a satisfying conclusion to an incredible trilogy."
"'there is... another... sky-y-walk-errr!'

Both a trilogy capper and a disturbing sign of things to come. Jedi over corrects Empires dark tone and goes a bit slapstick and overly child friendly... a future echo of the toy advert prequel trilogy to come. 

Jedi does the job and ties up all the plot threads and has fun doing it. Han Solo is pretty wasted here and the ridiculous good fortune of a race of sentient teddy bears versus a well trained and equipped  military force are only minor niggles in the face of a solid (if flawed) Star Wars film.

'it's a trap!'"
"I don't know how to feel about this film. 4 and 5 will always be at the top of my Star Wars list while 1 and 2 will always be at the bottom, but I'm not quite sure where to place 6, 3, and 7. 6 Has that classic Star Wars vibe, but it also had some stupid prequel esque things in it such as the Ewoks. I also didn't see why Leia had to be Luke's sister, it just felt a little random and out-of-nowhere. It was also strange how there was another Death Star. Just repeating a big beat from the last film (as seems to be a trend in Star Wars now). The acting also didn't feel quite as genuine when Luke was talking with Vader, Obi-Wan, and Leia. I don't know, I think the dialogue he had to work with was just kinda robotic like a lot of the dialogue in the prequels and that was reflected in Luke's acting. Overall it's good, but it's also almost like a warning of what was to come. The best moments are easily the beginning and the end with the end being the highlight of the film. The end battle is honestly what puts the film (alongside 3 and 7) between episodes 4 and 2 for me. But whatever, I'll give it a 3.5/5"
"Entertaining conclusion of the original Star Wars trilogy later to be retitled as Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi.
The heroics, space battles and adventure witnessed in Episode V continue with the introduction of new worlds, furry creatures and well..disgusting ones!
The film begins with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) a prisoner of gangster Jabba The Hut on the planet Tatooine being cryogenically frozen in a substance called carbonite for good measure!
Not to worry for he is rescued by returning characters Luke Skywalker  (who broods in a black outfit through the film), Princess Leia  (the late actress Carrie Fisher) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).
The remainder of the film sees the remaining rebel alliance fight off the construction of a new and even bigger Death Star by the empire.
Aided by cute, furry creatures called Ewoks (to appeal to younger audiences perhaps?).
I thoroughly enjoyed rewatching this instalment after many years and feel that perhaps it should have been left there instead of countless releases on home video and prequels, sequels and standalone movies?"
While admittedly not as good as it's predecessors return of the Jedi offers some of the best characters in the entire trilogy.
just wish they didn't taint it with the edited java dance music scene
"Lucas makes due on his promise for an ending to the trilogy that defined a generation. The Ewok set-pieces mar the serious tone, and the movie falters from its own cliche. Luke, now a Jedi Knight, enters the heart of darkness as a fully-fledged but tempted hero on the precipice between good and evil. Entertaining and fun for the whole family, 'Jedi' loses some of the complexity set forth by 'Empire'. A much needed end to the epic saga, this movie was destined for cult classic status."
"I liked this film slightly more than the first two I have seen, but only slightly. I am getting into the more ""modern"" films and I have been told that those are the most impressive ones. We shall see."
"I will have to give this film a 3.5 star rating. To me, this was an ok movie. The visual effects were good for its time, the acting was great, and the plot was ok. The problem with this film was that it started to get uninteresting to watch after a while. However, I enjoyed watching the ending of this film. This was a pretty good finish to the original Star Wars trilogy."
"While not quite as dark as ESB, ROTJ continues the action and adventure through to a satisfying conclusion. While the story arc improves in some areas while at the same time leaving us scratching our heads in others, the special effects are undoubtably better, and the story moves faster than ever with an epic and powerful conclusion."
"Luke's progression as a Jedi is very nice to follow. He is now a bad-ass Jedi with confidence, which is a great change of pace from A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. The Rebel's final blow is a well put together 3-part sequence that ends with a fulfilling conclusion."
"Great = 4/5 

""Return of the Jedi"" ties up the original trilogy perfectly. Not to mention it contains one of the best, most emotional and intense light saber fights do date... and Ewokes... come on. you love them as much as I do. How could you not?"
"Battle of Endor, battle between father and son, fate of Boba Fett, Anakin, Emperor, and Jabba, nice ending, but too jokie at times"
"I've watched every Star Wars film hundreds of times and though it deserves a higher rating then what I'm giving it, the fact is it definitely doesn't deserve as high a ranking as the trendy folks that love teddy bears  and have deluded themselves into thinking that these waddling creatures could accomplish this much while looking past the many plot holes and somewhat poor acting. I mean the movie only has about 15 minutes good scenes and they have seen fit to give it a 4 of 5!? What a joke.. I wonder if it was mostly drooling generation x who gave it this ranking."
2nd best movie out of all of them....
It was overall good but I was getting tired until the end scenes
"An underappreciated entry in the Star Wars Saga, Return of the Jedi combines the sense of adventure of the original film, with the emotion-driven personal drama of Empire.

While flawed, Jedi is a wonderful conclusion to the original trilogy, with Ian McDiarmid stealing the show as Emperor Palpatine."
"Star Wars return of the Jedi is the weakest of the 3 Star Wars movies, there is certainly A lot to like in that, the first act is amazing, but everything towards the third act starts to become ehhh, the 3rd act is pretty good, but the 2nd act is the weakest in the whole movie. Most of the characters in the movie are given nothing to do, the only people that have something to do are Luke, Darth Vador, Princess Leia, and the emperor. The rest aren't given anything to do but shoot and destroy the Death Star. The 2nd and 3rd act is a new hope again, sure they change and add some things, like the confrontation between Luke, Darth Vador and the emperor, and that's great. Anyway that's where my complaints end. The 2nd act isn't bad so I would say it's decent, the 3rd act is pretty good, so I would say the movie is pretty solid and for the most part pretty good. It's better than all the prequels. There are good things, The action is still great, the effects are fun, the acting is great, the movie looks beautiful, the script is ok, so it's a very decent movie, I like it. It's isn't bad nor great, it's the weakest of these 3 Star Wars movies by far."
"Honestly, this is the worst of the good Star Wars movies. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad--the plot is still excellent, the characters are great, especially Skywalker, and the entire Tatooine sequence is legendary. However, once the Ewoks show up, this movie goes a little downhill. It gets a little boring and disappointing. Despite this, it is still a very good movie that deserves a watch.

Oh, and I do prefer The Phantom Menace to this."
the ewoks ruined this movie
"Despite being the weakest of one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time, the emotional stakes are at their height of the franchise."
"Although the effects are outstanding, the story seems like it could be reduced to an hour long movie. The Jabba the Hutt and the Ewok parts are boring and don't add anything to the plot. The entire plot leads up to yet another space battle and lightsaber fight, the new Death Star is blown up due to some weakness (oh, really?) and the stormtroopers are taken to a new low, being beat by a bunch of tiny fuzzy creatures. In all, the movie does not compare to the spectacular achievements of the two previous films."
"""This finale to the original trilogy is not as good as the first two were, but it's still entertaining as ever. It has emotional moments, good humor, great action, and a fantastic score from John Williams once again. The only problem I have with this film is the Ewoks. Sure they're cute, but is it necessary to put them into action? I don't think so. However, the story continues to make this epic a success."""
"My second favorite Star Wars film! While flawed, is still a damn satisfying ending to the original trilogy!! Good film!"
"I love this movie, a lot of nostalgia"
A tale that should have been over - rewoven from the many strong character threads previously established. Then gears are shifted and the tale panders to a yet established future fan base. Very curious.
Return of the Jedi is an epic conclusion to a great 3 part story arc.
The most underrated film from the original trilogy. It's an extremely satisfying way to end the best or 2nd best trilogy of all time.
"Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi is the last movie from the original films. The acting, story, characters and mystery is great. But some parts to the film does slow down in the wrong way, but that doesn't stop Return Of The Jedi from being a really great film."
"Return of the Jedi is a good Star Wars movie but it has a slow first act, strange and questionable creatures, and a retread on the original."
Return of the Jedi manages to give a fitting conclusion to a fantastic trilogy whose legacy resonates louder with the years.
En lättklädd Leia! ;)
"It was a smidge under the hype following Star Wars and Empire. It had a lot to live up to. Also, the Ewoks probably didn't help (depending on your taste). However, despite all of that, it still delivered. It was a great conclusion to an epic trilogy!"
Not as good as episode four or Empire but still a great conclusion.
I will miss Darth Vader for sure..
"Might be the weakest of the originals, but still amazing"
"some people think return of the jedi is a masterpiece like the first two others think it's just in the middle of good and bad. I think it's a solid conclusion to the star wars original saga there are definitely noticeable flaws with the film but it's still damn good. the battle for endor is a great battle which I loved as a kid but now I don't like it as much as I used to. no it certainly isn't best movie ever material, but it is still a great movie.


Owens grade: B+"
"Luke, Han, Leia, 3PO and R2-D2 have done it again!"
"Return of the Jedi is my favourite Star Wars movie, OK, bar the ewoks, but it's more fun, and the pirate ship(ish) scene is just so cool."
Way better than Star Trek!
this deserves at least a 90 percent...critics make it happen
"Originally titled ""Revenge of the Jedi"", but changed since a true Jedi wouldn't seek revenge. Great end to the original trilogy. Seeing Darth Vader save his son and defeating Darth Sidious, proving that Anakin Skywalker was the chosen one gives all fans an awesome feeling! Loved it"
It was almost ruined by the Ewoks.
"While it may be the weakest of the three, Return of the Jedi is still a fitting end to the incredible original Star Wars trilogy."
"My favorite movie of all time. Excellent wrap-up to the trilogy, the turn of events at the end was amazing and kind of sad, and a call for nerds everywhere. But what are people talking about it being too kid-friendly? Luke gets freakin' electrocuted!"
A great way to cap off the trilogy! Solid acting all around A god plot great effects as always. I wish it had been a bit better toned i think at times it was unclear what tone they were going for. But i really love this movie none the less.
"A somewhat bittersweet conclusion to the greatest trilogy of all time, and the truly sad things is that if those Ewoks were Wookees, this movie would have been amazing. Instead we get the original trilogies version of Jar Jar Binks. 

I still recommend it, but it could have been so much better."
A thrilling conclusion to the trilogy in which we once gain experience the emotional and exciting journey that is the original Star Wars trilogy. You'd be mad not to watch it.
"The conclusion of the Star Wars trilogy ends with Return of the Jedi; one of the most remarkable films in cinematic history next to Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, and a satisfying conclusion to the franchise."
"*****SPOILER ALERT*****

Star Wars Return of the Jedi is the great ending to a flawless franchise. This episode introduces the great master yoda and brings in the phrase everyone knows ""Luke I am your father."" It also shows that there is another Jedi master Darth Vaders daughter and Luke's sister princess Leiah. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
"The Star Wars movies are my favorite movies of all time. Personally Return of the Jedi is my favorite because of the love story, the conflict, the action and overall the epic finally to the god-like trilogy. I believe that 80 percent on rotten tomatoes is very underated for this movie it should be at least 92 percent.People rip on this movie for not being as good as empire, but I think its just a better movie.Some people don't love it because of the ewoks and jabbas palace but I love those scenes.For those who like empire better then this I can tell you one thing better about this movie and that's the story, which empire lacked.Don't get me wrong empire strikes back is an incredible movie, but I just hate how half the fans put this so much over the other films in the saga. The characters in return of the jedi are phenomenal. Luke in this film is the main reason why I love the character, him as a muture Jedi knight is so enjoyable to watch. Of coarse, Han Solo,Leia, and the rest of the gang really expand their characters in it as well. Going on to vader and palpatine their phenomenal also! We finally see Vader for the first time return to the light side and have major conflict between his son Luke. Palpatine was such a great villian in the film and was part of the exiting ending battle! Overall the return of the Jedi is an excellent movie and as much as its loved I think it can have more respect."
"In my opinion this is probably the worst film in the original trilogy, but given the prequels that definitely isn't the worst thing to be said about the Star Wars franchise. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this movie, but at the same time I find the acting strangely bland (especially from Mark Hamill) and we see everything work out almost too conveniently for the good guys the entire time. It's still fun, it's still classic, it's still Star Wars, it just lacks the edge and genuine excitement the first two movies delivered."
"It's a good finally however it's bogged down by the Ewoks and some awful scenes, still worth a watch though!"
I don't know how I feel about the ewoks and the Death Star but I do know how I feel about the ending to the greatest trilogy of all time.
"When I was younger, I used to see this as my second favourite in the original Star Wars trilogy. But now, looking back, I do notice a bit more of the flaws that I hadn't noticed before. While the film is still visually amazing and a very fun ride, it does suffer from one single problem, and that being that it's far too lengthy (a lot of sequences could have been shortened and that would've kept the film's pacing much smoother). But for what it is, it's still a very good film."
I really like this Star Wars film before the force awakens
"An odd tonal shift from episodes 4,5 to 6 does not stop this film from being a satisfying conclusion to the Star Wars saga. Certainly not on par with A New Hope or Empire Strikes back though."
Even though it's the sixth I'll never get bored of Star Wars
A great finally to Star Wars
"Return of the Jedi ends the start of the trilogy with a mind-blowing conclusion. However, despite a more dramatic story, it does flop as it is somewhat a copy of Episode 4."
Though it doesn't quite live up to the hype Return Of the Jedi brings this epic trilogy to a satisying and action and thrill filled conclusion
"The final part of the original Star Wars trilogy does, for me, dip a little following on from the first two stunningly good movies. Don't get me wrong, it does have some great scenes and does nicely round off the tale. I even like the Ewoks. But the way in which the Death Star mk II is blown up is a bit too reminiscent of the first film and the whole confrontation with the Emperor, Luke and Darth Vader is a little too obvious. As I said, however, there are still some great parts. I like the whole set-up in Jabba's palace and the rescue of Han, the chase on the speeder bikes through the forest of Endor and the attack on the shield generator all work well but maybe smack a bit too much of a formula emerging that seems to be replayed over and over in the franchise. The Empire Strikes Back had felt so very different from A New Hope and it would have been great had Return of the Jedi been a little edgier and not so safe. Still, this movie fits neatly with what had gone before and doesn't really harm the saga. These three movies seen together as a whole package are great, family films and changed the face of a whole genre of cinema forever. Science fiction went from being geeky and maybe slightly embarrassing to becoming a major player, earning millions at the box office and helping create the phenomenon of the big, holiday blockbuster experience."
gets a lot more slammed on than it really needs to be because this movie is still amazing and has probably some of the best moments in the whole franchise.
"Although failing to surpass A New Hope, Return of the Jedi is the best written film in the saga."
Star Wars Return of the Jedi was a great start in the franchise.      Now history is repeating itself after defeating the Empire and  known hero Darth Vader who had revealed everything to his son about the emperor's plans but now they are both defeated as one but a new chapter will begin in the Star Wars franchise what a good way to start the ending of the IMAX film but now we know you're going to be more Star Wars movies completing the trilogy.        giving this movie A 10-point.
The best film of original trilogy has an outstanding action sequence
"During the first half, it's obvious that the creators have tried really hard to deliver the ugliest film of all times. And they have succeeded. On top of that, the acting remains fairly bad (Harrison Ford the only possible exception), the effects totally unconvincing in the 21st century and the storytelling rather problematic. The film is definitely salvaged by the pretty good prolonged battle at the Death Star and Luke's confrontation with Darth Vader. Overall above par but too far from great."
A great end to one of the best movie trilogys of all time.It has alot of what made Empire and New Hope so great.The only really annoying thing is the ewoks in general.
Classic.  'nuff said
My favorite of the original trilogy.
"One of the top in Star Wars
Cool story love ending 

And I know ewoks seem far fetched to beat empire but cute addition hoping for a return of them"
"Return of the Jedi is a fun and exciting Star Wars adventure with lots of action and adventure. Luke begins the film by saving Han and by the end must face Vader to complete his training and end the struggle between the light and dark side. I enjoy the lightsaber duel in this film more than any because of the dialogue between characters and the rage that Luke shows at the end. Even though this movie has some flaws like the re-use of the Death Star and the Ewoks being able to beat Storm Troopers, overall Return of the Jedi is a good movie with one of the greatest character arcs in cinematic history of Darth Vader."
"Not the best Star Wars movie, but still a great conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy."
"While it may not be quite as good as the classics that preceded it, Return of the Jedi is still a fantastic conclusion to an amazing trilogy."
A very entertaining chapter
Amazing film but has a later movie problem.
"While the film's pacing limits its ability to remain in the same standard as the previous films in the trilogy, Return of the Jedi concludes the great trilogy ever made through delving deeper into emotions and maintaing a genuine tone"
NERF THE EWOKS- WAY TOO OP
Brought this trilogy to close perfectly. Characters continue to grow and interactions between them are excellent. Scene between Luke and Leia in the Ewok village is one of the best acted of the film. Of course starting out back on Tatooine (full circle) was such a great idea. The entire sequence at Jabba's palace was very memorable. Plus seeing Luke wield his lightsaber as a Jedi Knight was amazing. This film gets a lot of hate from some people but I actually really really liked it although the changes that Lucas made to it in his many special editions took away from what the original (what I am basing this rating off of) had.
"Though Return of the Jedi isn't as great as it's predecessors, it's still a very entertaining and good film that successfully brings the original trilogy to a close. The only problems that are with the film is some of the green screen effects are dated, Boba Fett dies just like any old pawn would, when he clearly isn't, and, of course, the Ewoks. Now I did love the Ewoks as a kid and I totally get it if you love them, but I can't help but notice that they're there strickly for merchandising purposes but, unlike the prequels, that's the only thing that I've noticed in this movie that was there only to sell toys."
"Star Wars is what cinema is all about. Creative work, originality, charm, memorable characters, and the truest form of art and entertainment. These films truly bring you to another world that resonates a feeling of familiarity. People and cultures from all edges of our world are brought together by these films, and with an impact that large, you just know that it's something special. 

Star Wars always had the cutting edge effects of its age and, to this day, still proves to be incredibly entertaining. I find myself many times just smiling throughout the film out of pure enjoyment as I get to witness timeless cinema.

After the first release of Star Wars, Mark Hamil, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fischer became icons over night. Even today when they were back on the big screen for The Force Awakens, they had the presence of legends. 

Star Wars is where imagination comes to life for not only children, but for adults as well. Star Wars is the reason for so many people to become involved with film, and this reason alone is one of many reason why Star Wars is one of the greatest films in of all time.

The production of the films is what I love the most to see in cinema. The practical effects of puppetry, modeling, painting, stop motion animation and countless other artistic talents are combined into each and every one of Star Wars' original trilogy. The reason why the newer Star Wars trilogy wasn't received as well is because those films lost all of the artistic talent that was put into the original trilogy.

Very few films are or ever will be like Star Wars. 

Star Wars: 5 stars
The Empire Strikes Back: 5 stars
Return of the Jedi: 4.5 Stars"
"Almost third best Star Wars movie,"
Great movie with a good story and memorable characters. Just not as good as Empire...
"Even though it's really good, it falters to Empire."
Probably the worst of the original series but that's on original trilogy standard and that's pretty high
"Though still fun, it is flawed and didn't live up of its predecessors"
"Having reached a high peak in popularity, the Star Wars saga had become one of the biggest cinematic hits of all time with two exceptional films under its belt. After The Empire Strikes Back, audiences were left salivating for the final entry in the original trilogy. Released in 1983, Return of the Jedi proved to be another great entry in the saga, even if it is a slight step down from Episodes IV and V.

Return of the Jedi begins around a year after Episode V; Han Solo has fallen into the clutches of the crime boss Jabba the Hutt, and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) all team up to rescue him. While this is going on, the Empire is in the process of constructing a new death star, with the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) himself arriving to oversee the operation of the new battle station alongside his apprentice Darth Vader. A final confrontation is coming, and our heroes must pull everything together, not to mention enlist the assistance of a few unexpected allies to finally liberate the galaxy. Unlike the previous episode which was always moving forward, Episode VI is much more irregular in its pacing; there's plenty of action for sure, but there are also many more moments where things slow down for more quiet and intimate character interactions. It's the calm before the storm for our three heroes, a fitting pace before the final act arrives, where some of the most extravagant and important action takes place. A theme of darkness also seeps into the Episode's final scenes, particularly with the Emperor's entrance into the proceedings. Overall, Return of the Jedi delivers a satisfying ending, delivering both powerful emotions and stirring set piece moments where it counts.

Episode VI marks the end (At least until The Force Awakens) of the character arcs that fans became so invested in over the course of six years and some characters receive more attention than others. Luke, whose personal story is at the centre of the film, shows a substantial distance from who he was before; he's no longer a simple farm boy, nor is he an over-confident padawan who interrupted his training. Instead he's a strong-willed warrior, one who even seems ruthless in some places. Luke appears ready for a second confrontation with Vader, but there is also an unpredictable dynamic that lingers over his character; which side of the force will he swing towards? That is the main question the audience is forced to ponder. Han and Leia's relationship remains on a relatively straightforward course, but when the revelations surrounding Luke are eventually revealed, Carrie Fisher injects much more emotion into her role than in previous films. Lando, Chewbacca, and Wedge maintain the likeability and charisma they had before, the stories of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Yoda (Frank Oz) both come full circle and the newer characters, such as Admiral Ackbar (Timothy M. Rose) and Mon Mothma (Caroline Blakiston) convey a surprising amount of authority despite their relatively slim time on screen. The villains also reach the pinnacle of their character arcs; Darth Vader, supposedly the most evil being in the galaxy starts to show subtle yet poignant hints of humanity within him. That's because he has been almost supplanted by an enemy far greater than himself. Ian Mcdiarmid is every bit as excellent as he was in the prequels; the unnerving ways he moves, speaks and toys with Luke, he's practically the dark side incarnate and almost demonic in his appearance.

Episode VI ends up being a mixture of old and new with its special effects. After a brief foray back to the deserts of Tatooine, the main on-location spot this time is the forest of Endor, which is brilliantly captured with the Redwood National Park. The creature effects are also the best yet with a welcome throwback to the original cantina scene through the weird and wacky creatures in Jabba's palace; the frightful rancor still looks massive even to this day and Jabba himself, along with the Sarlaac pit are both suitably ugly and repulsive things in both appearance and noise. Not so impressive however, are the silly little Ewoks. They were the first aspect of Star Wars that were geared almost entirely to children, something that would eventually be taken to its most ridiculous level in Episode I sixteen years later. The film does get quite creative with the battle they partake in, but nevertheless it does put the brake on the tension a bit when you see a platoon of armoured soldiers get bested by a primitive tribe of teddy bears. But where the combat on the surface of Endor falters, the other sequences are fantastic in their execution. The space battle around the second death star is a fierce and desperate battle between ships, frigates and the massive space station. And then we have the final duel between Luke and Darth Vader, which is quite possibly my favourite moment of the entire series so far. It's such a powerful scene, with the psychological battle that the protagonist is caught up in, the way he throws himself at his father with full force, and the incredibly emotive score. It signifies more than any other scene that this is where it ends for the original trilogy and we anxiously await the final outcome. This is a case where the story and stakes succeed in driving the action and the final film in the original trilogy is all the better for it.

Return of the Jedi is a superb conclusion to a trilogy that has enthralled thousands for decades. It sits just beneath the films that came before because of a few goofy and underhanded moments, but when the film reaches its ultimate climax, the result is some of the most memorable and suspenseful moments in the whole franchise. With luck, it should be a worthwhile springboard for what is soon to come."
"More of a kid-friendly movie, but I don't care. It's still really good"
"Best order to watch Star Wars 
IV: A New Hope (original trilogy)
V: The Empire Strikes Back (original trilogy)
I: The Phantom Menace (prequel trilogy)
II: Attack of the Clones (prequel trilogy)
III: Revenge of the Sith (prequel trilogy)
VI: The Return of the Jedi (original trilogy)
VII: The Force Awakens (sequel trilogy)"
Great finale to the original trilogy.
"Not as good as the first 2 episode, or I should said episode 4 and 5, but this movie completes the Starwars saga, and this is enough to earn 4 star score from me."
"Return of the Jedi has some issues with pace and tone that would become more evident in the prequels, but it is still vastly superior to the prequels, and in the context of the original trilogy, these flaws can be forgiven.

I've always found Jedi to be the hardest to sit through of the original trilogy. Having recently rewatched it, I realize this is because the pace is a little more relaxed. The narrative doesn't quite have the sense of urgency throughout as the previous two films.

The second act is where most of this is evident. Conflicts are resolved a little too easily. When Yoda tells Luke there's another Skywalker with his dying breath, this could have opened a subplot about Luke trying to unravel this mystery. Instead, the ghost of Ben Kenobi sits down and tells Luke his sister is Leia in the very next scene. Another example is when the group on the Endor moon are planning to infiltrate the Empire's bunker, someone notes it's heavily guarded, and Han provides a throwaway line: ""Chewie and me have gotten into tighter places than this."" That line removes the tension from the scene by assuring us this will be an easy task.

Jedi is also tonally dissonant, although not as much as the prequels. I liked the Ewoks in the second act, when they provided a thorny situation for our heroes to get out of. By the time they are fighting the Emperor's supposedly most elite troops with primitive weapons and slapstick humor, they have overstayed their welcome. The tone of the Ewok battle is jarring next to the emotionally tense showdown with Luke and Vader that is occurring simultaneously.

Again, Return of the Jedi is a good movie and wraps up the original trilogy in an emotionally satisfying way, but hints at the problems that would be in full force in the prequels."
"Return of the Jedi is an excellent conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. With a suspenseful climax and compelling story, this movie will make you one with the Force."
"Dark, fast and fun. Return of the jedi though is more flashy then the first 2 brings the emotion and substance from the empire strikes back, and fun action adventure from star wars into one movie and brings us one of the greatest final conflicts in movie history and its the perfect ending to a perfect trilogy."
Es Star Wars!!!!!!!!
"Al igual de sus antecesoras la película sigue conservando la magia de su universo.
Los efectos siguen siendo excelentes y la banda sonora de Williams da un perfecto final.
Es la mas entrenidas de la esta trilogía, enfocado mas a las escenas de acción,
Pero el gran problema con eso que se acorten algunas escenas importantes.
Pero aun así es un gran final para trilogía."
My favourite Starwars movie
"Star Wars return of the Jedi, was a bit of a disappointment, compared to the two previous movies.
It definitely had high points. Including the final confrontation between Luke and the dark side, and a heart racing scene involving 
the new Death Star. But overall, fell a bit flat of its predecessors."
It doesn't the pass the bar set by Empire Strikes Back but  Return of the Jedi still has lots of sci-fi fun and some very epic moments that make it a fitting end for the classic trilogy.
"Coming off the heals of The Empire Strikes Back, very disappointing. But great nonetheless."
Mind blowing! The best from the three! It made me cry like a baby!
"A product of the 1980's, and stumbling over the same trappings that tripped up Beyond Thunderdome, Return of the Jedi is the rousing conclusion to easily the greatest trilogy of all time, it just can't live up to the dramatic heights of the previous two films. The film suffers from that dreaded second act curse, which is a little bloated here, and filled with some overly kid friendly characters and action. It starts off rousingly enough, and the first act is great, but the second act sort of meanders around, trying to get to the conclusion. On the bright side, though, it has fun doing it, delivering some iconic scenes in the process. The acting is just as good as before and the effects are stepped up once again, with both the practical and digital effects stunning. The final film in the trilogy is really good, but certainly not great."
"Star wars episode 6-Return of the jedi is great follow up to one of the best movies of all time. While it has its flaws its still a fantastic film.With exiting action,strange and creative creatures, and a father son relationship that wasnt in the other two, Return of the jedi is a good film that everyone should see."
"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is the last or the Original Trilogy, directed by Richard Marquand, and it stars the same cast from the previous films in a space film about the empire making another Death Star, and so Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, 3CPO and R2-D2 have to rescues Han Solo from Jabba the Hut, while Luke has to go face Darth Vader and the Emperor. I was hearing about how this is the least liked in the Original Trilogy, and after watching it, I can sort of see why, but that doesn't mean that the film is bad though, certainly better than the Prequel Trilogy. The acting is still as good as ever, and the special effects got even better. The soundtrack by John Williams is very memorable as usual, and the fight scenes are still exciting to watch. The writing by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas is well written which surprises me consider that George Lucas is sometimes known for his terrible writing. The speeder bike chase is a lot of fun to watch, and the Ewoks are cool, even though at times they feel like they are there to sell some toys, which I agree a bit with the fans. I even agree to the fact that it doesn't really make sense of how the Ewoks managed to defeat an army filled with well trained soldiers with just sticks, rocks, and logs, which for logs I didn't mind that much. I guess it's worst than A New Hope, but Return of the Jedi really shouldn't get a bad rep for that as it's just as great as A New Hope, and it gave a satisfying conclusion to the Original Trilogy."
"I gotta say, I did not expect Vader to save Luke as he was getting attacked by the Sith Lord. Thus movie was great like the rest of them, as it has a fantastic graphic structure for its time. This movie is once again a hit."
The weakest of the original trilogy and yet still an extremely entertaining sci-fi film and a very good ending to the trilogy.
"The performances are again not that great and the film is again not quite as revolutionary, but the visuals and emotion again make up for it.
Full review is on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMRQq5p90RE&index=20&list=PLvBOglByjFAMzW8Fy68M-pxM-sR3vR8fg"
An Amazing conclusion of my favorite franchise of all time
"Greatness, that's all I got to say about this movie."
"Clearly the best of the first three episodes, it has its own weird creatures and stunning revelations."
"Jabba, Leia's gold bikini and Ewoks!"
My favorite Star Wars movie.
"Despite being slightly flawed, Return of the Jedi is still a great conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy and has some of the best moments the franchise has to offer!"
"Not as good as last two, still great"
"It lacks much of the great writing and compelling narrative choices of the previous two films, however Return of the Jedi remains a pinnacle sci-fi adventure that is a immensely satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy of Star Wars."
One of the greatest movies of all time. Greatest sequel of all time.
This is an amazing movie to end Star Wars!!
My favorite of the original trilogy.
"A perfect ending to the greatest sci-fi franchise of all time. Featuring heart, drama, and great action, ""Return of the Jedi"" is my personal favorite of the Star Wars films."
Love this movie just as much as the previous two
"Though it has significant flaws, you can't deny it brings a fitting close to the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader story. Not the best in the trilogy, but good enough."
"Not a perfect movie like The Empire Strikes Back but still a very good movie. Very emotional scenes in this movie. The Emperor was a great villain in this movie. We also learned even more about Darth Vader's character. As menacing as he is, we learned that he is very conflicted and that there is some good in him. Toward the end of the movie when Luke saw he was becoming like his father, when Vader saved his son, and when Vader took off his mask and saw Luke with his own eyes, these were all very powerful scenes.

This movie is certainly better than Revenge of the Sith but not better than A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back."
"The Ewoks and the Jabba's Palace sequences could have killed the movie, but thanks to the continuation of great action and the Light-Side/Dark-Side thematics, Return of the Jedi ends the series on a mostly positive note.

B+"
"We may also say that is the best, but it marks the best conclusion to close the second film trilogy of space. It is an epic conclusion."
Awesome movie but not as good as the rest of the originals
"The wrap up.  So in the aftermath of The Empire Strikes Back, a rescue mission has to be staged to bring back everybody's favorite lovable rogue Han Solo (Harrison Ford).  Not only that, but the Empire has begun construction on a second Death Star, all the while Darth Vader tries to convince Luke to come join him on the Dark side.  Even though I may not watch this series as much as the hardcore fans do, I always am able to get into the original Star Wars trilogy like a little kid whenever I do take the time to watch it.  Even if you don't care for it, you can at least see that all the fandom and admiration is well founded.  Return of the Jedi does everything that a third chapter is supposed to do in concluding an epic trilogy, but... it is the only one in the original trilogy that I do not consider to be a five star movie.  My favorite bit of trivia about Return of the Jedi is that the word ""Ewok"" is never mentioned once in the entire movie.  Yet, everybody knows exactly what an Ewok is, regardless of how much or how little you know about the movie.  The original script for this called for the planet of Endor to be inhabited by Wookies, but here is where George Lucas made a decision to go in a different direction.  It is a well known fact that Lucas, smartly, negotiated for merchandising rights on the very first film, and I can think of no other series that has made such astronomical profits from action figures.  I can also think of no better way to sell toys than to make an entire species of cute, cuddly warrior teddy bears, can you?  Gripes aside, even though I do consider Return of the Jedi to be a tipping point for the series, it is still a satisfying conclusion and a good cap off on a great trilogy.  Much like Hoth in the Empire Strikes Back, everything on Tatooine before the story really gets rolling is absolutely great and could easily stand on its own.  Everybody gets a proper send off, and it is a crowd pleasing story.  This is a series that forever changed the entire way Hollywood approaches blockbuster filmmaking, and for that, every single one of these movies demands to be seen, at least once in everyone's lifetime.  While I personally get more out of Episodes IV and V, they are all movies that deserve their respective spots on the 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die list."
"Inferior to the previous two installments in the Star Wars franchise, spends too much time on the Ewoks, suffers from a surprising downgrade in the FX department, and has a laundry list of conveniences for its protagonists. Despite its faults, Return of the Jedi nails the Luke-Vader conclusion, and puts a nice bow on the original trilogy."
"aun me sigue gustando más el episodio 5 pero me gusta mucho también esta mi orden seria asi
1-star wars episodio 5 el imperio contraataca
2-star wars episodio 6 el retorno del jedi
3-star wars episodio 3 la venganza de los sith
4-star wars episodio 7 el despertar de la fuerza
5-star wars episodio 4 una nueva esperanza
6-star wars episodio 2 el ataque de los clones
7-star wars episodio 1 la amenaza fantasma
(todas me gustan porque soy fanatico de star wars pero si una me gusta más que otra)"
"I must be among the select few people who enjoyed this film as much as I did Empire, and in some ways even more. The pacing is near-flawless, the atmospheres captivating, and where the predecessor began to show character maturity, this one brings it out in full. The final battle between Luke and Vader is perhaps not up to par with their previous one, but the whirlwind of emotions, motives, and themes of forgiveness and redemption bring it all together fantastically."
My fave Star War movie. It had great scenes in it.
"Re-watch in 2016. Starts off with a lot of fan service, Carrie Fisher looks stunning. The plot borrows heavily from last two movies for the weakest adventure yet, not as much fun or entertaining.  Decent watch but with time has lost its punch."
star wars episode 6 lukes now a jedi C-3PO treated as a king meating ewoks meating jabba the hutt again and the son of jango feat  boba feat green lightsaber for luke it is a great film because we get se ewoks the second father and son fight and everyone unites again for a 3rd time 4 stars 85%
My personal favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy.
my second fave in the SW saga so far anyways
"One of the best 3rd installment films ever. I always loved how this movie ended, feeling completed. In my opinion, this and Empire are my top 2 favorites. 
I loved seeing Luke becoming a Jedi Knight, always liked that he finally accomplished something he wanted to do. Being the last Jedi in the galaxy, making him their only hope to battle Vader and the Emperor. In this film, I wanted the Emperor to do more, like maybe have a lightsaber to have a duel with Luke. The ewoks were really silly to kill the stormtroopers, but too bad the stormtroopers can't shoot. 
Jabba the Hut was a cool villain. Leia in her slave outfit is really... wow
Overall, a great finale for the original trilogy."
Awesome! Ã°??? Just another great sequel to one of the greatest films of all time!
"Not a perfect movie, however a great conclusion to the original trilogy. Having the adventure, thrilling sequences and characters we all know and love!"
"Another Star Wars sequel, another Death Star blown up.  The action continues, Yoda, Darth Vader et al come to a fitting end.  George Lucas' recent re-edits are sacrilegious to the Star Wars ""canon"".  Edits such as replacing Darth Vader's ghost's head with Hayden Christianson and other subtleties seem like cheap fixes to a classic film.  This franchise installment is for fans only."
"Esta película... Meh, no fue tan buena como las anteriores, pero me pareció un gran desenlace."
In this movie luke's Skywalker conferences father and Pfiitze Darth Vader and Luke manages to win the fight. So the fighting was good and the action was good as well. But one thing I did not care for was the beginning with Jabba the Hutt. Jabba is very disgusting. Other than that it was a good movie
"""Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi"" (1983) is the stunning conclusion to the original Star Wars journey. It is the final story in the hero's journey of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), his harnessing of the positive powers of the Force, and his overcoming his fears and his foes, helping to rid the galaxy of the evil Galactic Empire.

What makes the film so heartbreaking is the very personal story at the core of the film, involving Luke Skywalker and his father Darth Vader (Sebastian Shaw). Luke now knows that the leader of the Dark Side of the Force is his father, a man who was once Anakin Skywalker. Unfortunately for young Skywalker, both Darth Vader and his superior, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), are trying to use this father-son connection for their own nefarious purpose.

Whereas young Luke Skywalker would like to defeat the empire and restore balance to the Force, both Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine want to use Skywalker as pawns in their own dark chess games. Emperor Palpatine would like to turn Skywalker to the Dark Side and make him the emperor's new apprentice and henchman, replacing his father Darth Vader. Vader, on the other hand, would like to overthrow the emperor and then rule the galaxy with Luke as father and son.

Good will triump over evil, but seeing how that is done is half the fun of this film. This film gets a lot of good for its Ewok planet, a planet that looks like it's inhabited by little teddy bears. But the film is still great, and even better than ""A New Hope"" (1977), based on pacing and character development alone."
Best possible conclusion to the best film trilogy of all time.
"cinegeek.de Nur ein kleiner Moment, doch er vermag so viel zu erzählen über die Magie von Star Wars: Luke Skywalker kämpft gegen das schleimige Monster Jabba the Hutt, dass durch eine fallende Tür zerquetscht wird. Kurz erhaschen wir den Blick auf einen muskelbepackten Untergebenen Jabbas, der weint. Er trauert um seine Kreatur. Es ist diese Dichte solcher Details, die Star Wars zu viel mehr machen als einer Seifenoper mit enormen Special Effects. Star Wars ist Liebe! Return of the Jedi wirkt vertraut, aber bietet doch viel Neues. Wir erleben, wie die Geschichten der Hauptcharaktere Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo und Princess Leia abgeschlossen werden. Ich denke, uns allen war aber bereits 1983 klar: In dem Moment, da George Lucas bei seinem Plan bleiben würde, neun Star Wars Episoden zu produzieren, würden sie (fast) alle wieder auftreten! Natürlich hätten auch die Roboter wieder einen festen Plan im nächsten Teil! Wie immer bei Star Wars ist die eigentliche Geschichte, die erzählt wird, nicht ausschlaggebend. Wie immer ist es eine Reise in unsere Imagination, in eine Welt weniger alltäglich als die unsere! Ausser Jabba the Hutt bietet die Jedi-Episode eine Reihe unvergesslicher Charaktere: Die knuddeligen Ewoks, die Einwohner des ""forest moon of Endor"", ein furchteinflössender Wüstenwurm oder hassenswerte Kreaturen, die Ratten ähneln. Star Wars verliert nie viel Zeit mit einer Einführung. So werden auch die Aliens einfach ins Geschehen geworfen. Doch wieviel Reichtum steckt in den Bildern! Jabbas Thron mit all den Kreaturen um ihn herum! Star Wars verweist auch gern über die Filme hinaus: Wir erleben eine halsbrecherische Verfolgungs Jagd im Wald, die bereits 1983 wunderbar als Vorlage für Computerspiele herhalten konnte. Return of the Jedi ist der unterhaltsamste Teil der klassischen Episoden. Beeindruckend, wie es Lucas und seinen Mitstreitern gelang, sich noch einmal selbst zu überbieten! Wie es aber gelang, in dieser Materialschlacht so viel Herz zu behalten - vermutlich kann nicht einmal Obi-Wan dieses Geheimnis lösen. mehr auf cinegeek.de"
7.5/10 - slightly better than Episode IV
"Return of The Jedi, originally called Revenge of The Jedi, is a classic film of the original Star Wars trilogy. This film did well with critics, and fans, even though it didn't have the anticipated success as A New Hope, or Empire Strikes Back, it's still a very good movie, and much loved by all Star Wars fans. You will still fall in love with this film, just like the other two, and love the ending to a great trilogy."
"Not as good at its predecessors however is still has great character moments, some of - cough Ewoks - make the film drag"
"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi is the ending of the original trilogy. While it certainly ends on a feel-good note, it is not without it's thoughtful moments, and provides many a memorable line and moment. The story begins with a brief scene of members of the Empire discussing the building of a new Death Star. After that, the action goes to Luke's home planet of Tatooine, where the heroes of the rebellion pull of an elaborate plot to rescue their comrade Han Solo. It is a great sequence of scenes that includes the debut of Luke Skywalker as a full-on Jedi. It also features Jaba the Hutt, Boba Fett, the rankor monster, and several other memorable creatures, not the least of which is a giant hole that almost swallows Lando Callrisian whole. 
	From there, Luke goes back to see Yoda die and tell him some mystical stuff about the force while the rest of the rebellion goes to the Forest Moon of Endor to try to break a defense shield generator so they can destroy the new Death Star. It features a great chase through the forest on some flying crotch rocket type vehicles, and ends up with the group of heroes making contact with the Ewoks, a furry bunch of folks who live in the trees, use primitive tools, and don't speak English. Perhaps the reason the the Eowks work better than the Gungans is because they speak their own language, and use believable weaponry, such as large logs to take out machines. There's also a part where one of the Ewoks dies and their comrade briefly mourns. 
	In the end, they defeat the Imperial troops, stop the shield and blow up the Death Star and all that, but not before Luke has his max-emo duel with his father who he almost-kills just enough to allow him to defeat the Emperor who SPOILER ALERT was going to kill Luke. Then a bunch of people dance and everybody is happy."
"Now this movie, my friends, is amazing! Everything about it is so great! It's funny, sad, it makes you laugh, and it makes you cry. The actors are fabulous. I'm a big fan of villains so the villains are amazing, in my opinion! I love the way it ends, too! It makes me feel good because Luke burns his dad's body and the ghosts of Anakin, Yoda, and Obi-Wan look down on him and just smile! It makes me feel so good! Not the part where Luke burns the body because that's sad. And I love that Luke could look his dad in the eyes before he died."
"While the emotional heft is certainly dumbed down when compared to The Empire Strikes Back; The Return of the Jedi still manages an ideal balance between stunning cinematic grandeur, a satisfying closure to it's beloved characters story arc and a fresh ammount of settings and characters."
This movie was really good it was a really good way to end the story of Darth Vader
"This was a bit of a surprise, I'd always kind of remembered Jedi as being the limp conclusion to the trilogy but it's really not.  Again supposedly Lucas has handed over the directorial reigns (but not really).  The first hour or so in Jabba's palace is brilliant and so is the Father-Son battle between Luke and Vader.  Even the Ewoks aren't quite as annoying as I'd remembered.  Can't wait for the new entry now."
"A great film, kept the feel of the other two in the original trilogy. It keeps you hooked throughout and has some fantastic emotional moments."
"Return of the jedi may be the worst of the three,but its worth it."
"This is hokey, but still fun, just like the previous entries in the original trilogy. I know Lucas went a little overboard with ""creatures"" in this movie, but I'm willing to go along with it because the characters, universe, and overall plot (not just of this entry, but the entire trilogy overall) are so compelling. (I bet you didn't know that one of the ewoks was played by Tony Cox, the little person who played Marcus in Bad Santa.)"
Ewok is less fitting for the tone of film.
"The worst of the original trilogy, but still a strong  movie ."
"Though there are some strange decisions put into the production. (I.e. The Ewoks) Return of the Jedi ties the loose ends up left from Episode V, and leaves a satisfying and exciting conclusion to a pop culture phenomenon."
Another classic Star Wars entry that does not disappoint fellow fans.
This maybe technically the best of the original trilogy but it already possess some annoying parts which makes it overall the weakest part...if I ever have to stand these teddy bear like ewoks again or this sorry bunch of hut scum l'lI need to retch...I still like the universe but in the meantime its nicer  to experience it in computer games...because they know how to transport the dark atmosphere of the imperium
loved it.  Really liked the battle of endor.
"Serving up as many iconic moments as the first two chapters without achieving the same levels of near-perfection, the hugely entertaining Return of the Jedi nonetheless brings the first trilogy to a very satisfying end. Giving way to family-friendly hokeyness (Meet the Ewoks!), the third chapter loses some of its darkness but manages to solidify the father-son story at the center of this galactic knight's tale. So much about this series is about connectivity: dark-light, father-son, sister-brother. For better or worse, Return of the Jedi hits you over the head with it, tying characters and ideas together like a bow on the final package. When the series continues 30 years later with The Force Awakens, in fact, the audience comes expect - and rightly so - that new and old characters will somehow be related through more than grit and spit. 

In this PG-rated sci-fi adventure, Han Solo gets rescued from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, the rebels attempt to destroy the second Death Star, and Luke struggles to make Vader return from the dark side of the Force. 

The actors never perform better than in this, their final chapter of the first trilogy. Hamill excellently elevates Skywalker from farm boy to Cool hand Luke, Fisher (metallic bikini aside) earns respect as a military leader despite being tossed around between her brother and lover as an object of affection, and Ford remains the most hypnotic presence on-screen throughout. Darth Vader gets a hero's sendoff as well, emerging from the embers of villainy as a complex dark horse who never stopped loving his son. Sure, the clowning of cub-like Widget the Ewok alone brings the tone into a more comedic realm but the action - from the desert prisonbreak of Solo from Club Fett to the speeder bike chase on Endor - makes for indelible fist-pumping thrills. 

Bottom line: Rebel Yell"
Emotional and dramatic. It's a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy
"Fantastic final act, terrible ewoks tho..."
"The most bizarre begining of a Star Wars movie with the Jabba Court, the best explotion with the New Death Star, and the most epic and climatic final duel of all, makes Return of the Jedi my favorite movie of the galactic saga"
"""Jedi"" gives us a satisfying, if flawed, conclusion to the trilogy.  The reuse of the Death Star is tired by now, and the assortment of alien creatures (especially the Ewoks) adds a childish goofiness that seems to undermine the movie's tone.  Luke's final confrontation with the emperor and Vader are masterful and iconic."
"Its the weakest in the trilogy. The opening was boring and the visual effects are dated, not comparing it to what we have now but comparing it to Empire. Ewoks were stupid, the only characters that did anything of use was Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor. The scenes between the 3 were amazing. Some of the best in  the franchise, I wish I could say that for the rest of the movie."
"Not the strongest of the trilogy, but Return of the Jedi has high stakes and a really satisfying ending to the original Star Wars saga."
Star Wars episode 6 was a very good film. A few flaws though.
The scene between Luke and Darth Vadar is the best scene I've ever seen!
"Despite being significantly weaker than its predecessors (Namely as a result of its somewhat frustrating final act and a less graceful script than the rest of the original trilogy), Return of the Jedi is still just as involving and visually sharp as the best of the Star Wars films. Verdict: A low B+

Note: I saw the theatrical version of the film."
"Maybe not as flawless as the previous two films, Return of the Jedi culminates in poignant character arcs and one of the greatest endings in cinema history.

Luke isn't a whiny kid looking for power converters anymore; he's a full-fledged Jedi. From the first time we see Skywalker, there is a stark contrast between the rash Luke who rushed to face Vader and the Jedi Master who formulated a cunning plan to save his friends. The Ewoks and Death Star rebuild are admittedly weak points in the film, but they are overcome by the action-packed emotional high of the Emperor-Vader-Luke exchange. Return of the Jedi is an incredibly satisfying ending to one of the greatest trilogies in movie history."
"While not as good as its two predecessors, return of the jedi takes us back to a galaxy we know and love."
My second favourite (so far)!  Loving properly watching Star Wars for the first time (5 stars)
A great conclusion to the original trilogy. It has the best action sequences and the final conflict between Vader/Luke/Emperor is so powerful. The ewoks are great but they don't keep this film from five stars
"ROTJ continues to expand the Star Wars universe and concludes the original trilogy fittingly, with improved special effects and sci-fi action. The only downside is that it diverges from the first two, losing some of the powerful story and epic scale that makes Star Wars so great. Still, this is a Star Wars film through and through, and a worthy conclusion to the blockbuster trilogy that forever changed moviemaking."
it's one of my favorite movies and I watched all of them and I think there all amazing
"Experience the triumph of the Force in the epic conclusion to the 'Star Wars' saga! Following Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) capture and Carbonite entombment, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and the two droids set out to free him from the clutches of the vile gangster, Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Imperial forces prepare to crush the Rebellion once and for all with the construction of an even more powerful second Death Star. But even greater than the massive attack that Rebel forces will deliver on the half-completed station is the sinister plan that the Emperor himself sets into motion to bring a certain father and son together one final time for in a vicious, climatic duel!

While not as outstanding as the first two films in the trilogy, 'Jedi' delivers an incredibly rousing conclusion! All of the unanswered questions from the first two films are satisfactorily answered here: Will Han Solo get out of the Carbonite? Is Darth Vader really Luke Skywalker's father? And exactly who is ""the other"" that Yoda spoke of? The conclusion to one of the most epic sagas in filmmaking history will leave you feeling grateful for the Force!"
awesome movie this one is my 3rd favorite star wars movie
"""Jedi"" will always have a special place in my heart. Although it isn't as powerful as it's behemoth predecessor (Empire Strikes Back), it is still very much the kickass Star Wars we know and love. It almost seems to me that it had some conflicting direction, though."
great ending to a trilogy
"Pretty glorious, but if I thought this was the true end of the saga I might be disappointed by the amount of time spent with Ewoks. I love the Ewoks and C-3PO's antics, but the rest of the film is so strong that it starts to weigh down the third act. When expertly trained stormtroopers are being toppled over by rocks and beaten by little fury creatures, belivability gets stretched quite a bit (even for this outlandish universe). In contrast, I think the shoot out scene around the Sarlacc pit is one of my favorite sequences in the franchise! I don't even mind Hayden Christensen CGI'd into the force ghost image. Great would-be finale."
"5 stars for the untouched originals
1 star for the ""Special Edition"""
Loved it as a kid but watch again and still liked it but not overly as excited as most. I'm not a big d SyFy person. This one was my favorite of them though. Jabba the Hutt.  and the Ewoks.
"Despite being beautifully filmed and technically magnificent, George Lucas just... well, he got too ""George Lucas-y"" on this one. Stupid, STUPID, annoyingly childish jokes plus the Ewoks in general almost ruined this film for me. In my mind, this film is the beginning of the Star Wars slump that is miraculously salvaged with Revenge of the Sith. This movie didn't have to be mediocre; there are so many reasons to love it and in many ways it is a fitting conclusion to an incredibly influential film saga. It's just difficult to take seriously, or even stay awake through for that matter."
"Solid and exciting.  Many iconic scenes and action...Jabba the Hutt's palace, speeder bike chase on Endor's moon and the Ewoks helping to battle the Empire.  Fitting close to the original trilogy."
"The opening scenes are terrific. The Ewok parts a bit lame except the payoff is they're a major help in the battle. The dialogue between Luke, his dad and the Emperor is what this movie is all about. I like Force Awakens more than this though."
"Beautiful Ending to the original Trilogy and the start of a new one, The force awakens."
"I think the first half of this film is actually the best hour of Star Wars. Is there a better feeling than when they fly away from Jabba's barge.

The 2nd half is the tedium of Luke saving Dad, and the Ewoks. Now Gertie loves the Ewoks so perhaps its about reaching out to another demographic."
Just as good as the new hope
A satisfying end to the original trilogy. Weighed down a bit by Lucas' edits and ewoks but overall a great conclusion.
"?????????, ?? ????? ???????? ??' ??? ???????????? ?? fans..."
"The finale of the original Star Wars trilogy is truly remarkable in many ways possible. It may be criticized by some people, but really love this film, it's terrific. Besides, since this was the last film in the trilogy, it still made us proud to be part of the Star Wars Family, so thanks return of the Jedi, you made us proud."
"*Spoiler Alert* The Star Wars series has reached new lows. In the last movie it was nice to see Han Solo being more involved in the story than Luke Skywalker. But in this movie Solo is barely seen and viewers instead are forced to put up with whiny Luke and Mark Hamill's wooden performance. I can't complain much about Carrie Fisher's performance as Leia. However, she was probably so high on cocaine that she thought what she was filming was actually real. George Lucas just had to mess things up. The first 45 minutes of this movie is a rescue mission for Han Solo where we see so many disgusting creatures (played by puppets of course) their only objective in the movie is to sell toys to kids. Unfortunately, this trend doesn't stop! Halfway through the movie, we're introduced to teddy bear like creatures called Ewoks who somehow are able to defeat an army of stormtroopers. The love triangle that has been apparent throughout this trilogy is resolved based on the reveal that Luke and Leia are siblings. How convenient. This twist doesn't do anything for the story except make way for Han and Leia to be together. What a waste. Having Leia be Darth Vader's daughter opens up so much potential but Lucas doesn't do a thing with it. The final battle was absolutely ludicrous. The emperor's motivations are never made clear. He's just bad for the sake of being bad. And all of sudden Darth Vader becomes good??? You can really pick this movie apart from any angle. From the awful George Lucas puppet creatures, to the pointless story line. From annoying C3PO having more screen time than Han and Lando combined, to the equally annoying Luke Skywalker being on screen. The final chapter of the Star Wars trilogy does not live up to the hype at all."
"Return of the Jedi, the end has arrived and I had to skip one big as its just full of characters singing and dancing which bored me to death. Like others its pretty boring and feels like a movie of two halves. One half saving Han Solo and his corny acting and stupid lines. The other half, the only interesting part of the whole franchise, Luke and Anakins. The final scenes between Luke, Vader and the emperor are excellent. But these scenes are just too few."
"Despite suffering from pacing issues and an inconsistent tone (e.g., the final confrontation in the Emperor's chamber juxtaposed with the cutesy Ewok battle), Return of the Jedi features some of the most memorable and iconic moments in the Star Wars saga. A worthy conclusion to the Original Trilogy."
"tons of action, dark atmospheres, final character development and great story telling, return of the jedi end the star wars trilogy on a high note."
A nice conclusion to the Star Wars trilogy
I can't believe I waited soo long to see this movie. It was amazing in its cinematic quality and technological achievement. I was hooked on to it despite the obvious commercial nature of the movie. The story was engrossing and the pace was fast. Now I understand the Star Wars madness.
"Being the result of George Lucas choosing to drop the serious sci-fi intense action and tragedy elements from ""New Hope"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"" in favor of introducing a Sesame Street-like story about the main cast meeting up with furry or slimy aliens, such as the seriously unlikable Jabba the Hutt and the Ewoks, who are all just annoying or troublesome, ""Return of the Jedi"" lacks the same golden intelligence of ""New Hope"" and ""Empire Strikes Back"". But it does at least finish away the story that Empire Strikes Back left dangling with a true climax, where Luke confronts Palpatine and Vader once and for all. In conclusion, the Star Wars story is much more enjoyable to watch starting from the start of ""New Hope"" and ending it at where Vader throws Palpatine away into the pit and peacefully dies glad that he saved his son."
"Rating: 86%
Although it struggles with its tone and plot more than the first two did, Return of the Jedi is still a fun, entertaining film that will delight Star Wars fans of all ages."
Movie had a drop in this episode. I think the cheesy romance ruined it. The sarcastic love made it much better in the previous 2 episodes.
"RETURN OF THE JEDI may be the weakest of the original STAR WARS trilogy, but it remains iconic, suspenseful, and dramatic at its pivotal moments."
"I would say that Richard Marquand is a crap director and only marginally better than Lucas himself, but anecdotal evidence suggests that Lucas had much less creative presence on Empire and he wanted to be more hands on for Jedi. And where was Empire's director Irvin Kerhsner at this time? Only cashing a paycheck making one of the worst James Bond films. Return of the Jedi is an uneven film, but it does have plenty of good stuff and more competency is on display than in anything Lucas directed. Instead of a straight forward review, I decided to just nerd out almost scene by scene.

Instead of a quick catch-up summary, the opening text crawl dumps the second Death Star reveal like it's meaningless. Even if they omitted it, the first scene is basically just Darth Vader landing on the new Death Star to reprimand some construction supervisor for not building fast enough. It's a missed opportunity and pretty inexcusable filmmaking.

""R2, look! Captain Solo, and he's still frozen in carbonite!"" Thanks for taking the time to explain that for anyone that's confused, gold butt.

This film has a notable amount of logical leaps. The droid torture scene, for example. What does Jabba hope to gain from burning some garbage can's feet? And why can't any information they have be extracted with a computer? The puppets in this scene are pretty shoddy compared to the creatures in the rest of the movie, especially Jabba, who looks more detailed and lifelike than any other made up thingy in the trilogy. The Rancor is well done too, even if it's kind of a sucky monster that's defeated by a garage door. Jabba's annoying little pet needed to have his head ripped off, though.

The scene where Jabba drops the slave dancer into the trap door is another mark against storytelling. I've never seen and I hope to never see the Special Edition version of this scene, but aside from how unsettlingly revealing the girl's costume is in a film that is essentially Lucas' first step towards pandering towards children in the franchise, the scene removes the element of surprise later on when Luke gets dropped in and we're basically just waiting for it to happen.

The rescue plan doesn't make any sense. Why sell Chewbacca to Jabba only to wait and come back later? How do they know they would keep him prisoner and not just kill him right away? Did they need the money that badly? Why is Leia wearing lipstick under her disguise? The implausible Han-Chewie reunion is adorable, though.

Leia in the slave bikini is one of the most iconic nerd boner moments in film history. Carrie Fisher looks undeniably sexy. But why the hell is it okay for us to feel like this? She's being subjugated and reduced to a sexual object. We're supposed to feel horrible for her. Right? Rip any woman's clothes off against her will and she's a victim. It would have been more dramatic for her disguise to be torn up with any exposed skin to be bruised and scraped. Instead we're kind of thanking Jabba for setting our loins ablaze.

And what about that sarlacc pit? Sure, the idea of being digested for over 1,000 years is unpleasant, but if the start of the digestion process doesn't kill you, starvation will after about two weeks. So, what, there's this thing that lives in the desert and grabs at things that run by like a venus fly trap? The desert is barren. How can it survive if space gangsters don't feed it regularly? Worst of all, in a proto-Jar Jar moment, Han kills Boba Fett accidentally. So much for that guy. The explosion of Jabba's sail barge is one of the best kabooms to ever come from ILM.

Something I didn't remember is Yoda telling Luke that he won't be a Jedi until he confronts Vader. But in the previous movie, he specifically told him not to do that so that he could complete his Jedi training. A mixed message you are giving. Or maybe Yoda was dying of space Alzheimer's. But then Obi Wan, who got a Force ghost haircut, encourages him to go after Vader too, when he also told him not to in Empire.

The whole reveal of Leia being Luke's sister is one of the worst, most half-baked afterthoughts in the franchise. Putting aside that time she stuck her tongue in her brother's mouth, she's a very high profile princess. The prequel BS about separating them for their protection makes no sense. She was in harm's way before Luke even held a light saber and both were heavily involved in dangerous, high stakes Rebel Alliance missions. They would have been safer being raised as Yoda's swamp children, since he managed to live alone and unmolested for about 20 years.

What's up with the Emperor's mouth? It's like he's trying to emphasize his mouth movements so deaf people can read his lips better.

The reunion of our heroes is too short lived, as they split up fairly quickly after a mercifully brief Rebel mission briefing. Instead of developing the Lando-Han friendship and how Lando fits in with the others, he goes off on his own to do a remake of the first film's trench run with some guy who looks a penis with fish eyes. This and the entire trip to Endor's moon just doesn't feel like they matter much compared to Luke's visit with the Emperor. Why couldn't everyone go on the shield generator mission and then attack the Death Star together?

The speeder bike scene is really cool and is probably one of the best action scenes in the entire trilogy. It seems weird and illogical to have dangerous high speed vehicles that travel within the forest, opposed to over or around it, when at any moment the scout troopers can slam into a tree if they get distracted. No side or rear-facing weaponry or collision detection warning seems short-sighted. But I guess the Empire really excels at impractical, easily defeated weaponry.

""I have felt him, my master.""
""Strange that I have not.""
Heeheeheeheheheheh.

What's to say that hasn't been said about Ewoks. They're commonly regarded as cute, but when I watched this time around, I noticed that their eyes are colorless and dead. Also working against the cute factor is, oh, I don't know, how they were going to cook and eat Han, Luke and Chewbacca? Imagine an alternate timeline where they're gnawing through barbecued Wookiee entrails while Darth Vader goes around exploding more planets.

Watching the little fur turds defeat an entire battalion of Stormtroopers is a trilogy low, Jar Jar on a wide scale. The awesome stop motion walker models look amazing, but they're wasted as comic relief here. Chewie commandeering one of them would have been sufficiently cool and entertaining on its own. But hurray for adorable murder.

""I know. Somehow, I've always known."" Except that time you made out with him.

Why do the pilots call Lando 'Gold Leader' instead of General? And how loosey goosey is the Alliance that they hand out general ranks to new guys like it was a free subscription to Men's Fitness?

The final space battle over Endor is passable, but not terribly memorable compared to first two films. It looks great and the Death Star explosion is bigger and better than the original confetti balloon, but it just seems like obligatory plot movement instead of an epic action set piece that created a new standard in visual effects.

Of course, the highlight of Return of the Jedi is the best light saber duel in the entire trilogy. In the first film, the fight was brief, kinda lame and only serves to write Obi Wan out of the picture. The one in Empire was about uneasy confrontation, with Luke fighting for his life, only to discover a truth that shakes him to his core. Jedi introduces a new character motivation for Luke in that he wants to reforge a bond with his father and turn him back to good. Darth Vader apparently wants Luke to help him kill the Emperor. And the Emperor doesn't seem to want another Skywalker notch on his headboard, but he wants to replace crusty, high maintenance Vader with a younger, possibly more powerful model and openly encourages Luke to kill him. Of course he's going to turn against you, you dumb albino.

It's all a bit weird, as there are no signs of Luke turning evil or being remotely tempted by the Dark Side. The Emperor, Vader and Yoda constantly talk about the power of the Dark Side to the point where it can be the only trigger in a drinking game, but it doesn't much matter. The Dark Side apparently thrives on normal human emotions like hate and anger, but Luke proves that you can and should feel these things and it doesn't have to define you. Why is killing the Emperor or Darth Vader something that would pull him towards the Dark Side, but it's okay slice up, shoot and explode a ton of Stormtroopers, TIE fighter pilots, Jabba minions and however many people on the original Death Star (368,937 according to Wookieepedia)?

So then, Darth Vader searches for a hidden, terrified Luke with the Force, psychically discovering that Leia is his daughter. When Vader threatens to turn her evil, Luke reveals himself. The music swells and emotions run high as Luke easily outfinesses Vader. For a moment, he was willing to give up on saving his father and killing him for the sake of his sister. But of course he doesn't finish him off. He's the good guy and good guys don't execute the unarmed and helpless.

What happens next is pretty stupid, even without the extra James Earl Jones 'Noooooo!'s added. For some reason, the Emperor genuinely thinks Luke will kill him and join the Empire. Why? Does he think that all poor people really want is to control, oppress and murder? It's still a great moment when Vader ultimately betrays him to save his son. For all the hoopla about the power of the Dark Side, it can't save you from being thrown down a big hole.

And so, Luke gives a tearful goodbye to his father after he sees his real face, the Death Star is destroyed (again) and we have lots of hugs, fireworks and Ewok music to go out on. And Wedge is there too. Remember Wedge? He was in all three movies but is somehow less developed than Boba Fett. Watch for Lando dancing awkwardly.

For all its flaws and silliness, the trilogy ends on a high note. These three films leave an incredible impression that stand the test of time. Star Wars changed the world forever and these original films will never be forgotten, no matter how much the brand gets diluted by prequels, merchandising, non-canonical works or Disney itself. The last film might be a huge step back in terms of overall quality, but at least it's decent enough to not be widely considered a terrible ending that some other unfortunate franchises were killed by."
WEAKEST OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY ......STILL VERY GOOD....
"The third in the series of the original films often gets the least praise it seems like. People really like to bash on the little ewoks for some reason. It was the prior generation's jar-jar binks I suppose. Despite this fans got a thrilling conclusion to the series with some of the best special effects ever seen on the screen. It's really a shame they did not start making 3 more star wars movies right after Return of the Jedi was completed. With the advanced special effects and actors more mature it could have been so amazing!

What's nice about the third film is seeing how the actors have changed over the years. Luke really does look like an adult now. He plays on the border of light and dark. And watching the movie you think it could go in many ways. There is much to enjoy and re-enjoy as you watch this movie over and over again. I love every bit of it.

Spoilers Below

Best Actor

Mark Hamil's Luke Skywalker does the best job I think for this final film. The focus was really on him and it's great to see the character changed in this one. He holds his outbursts in more and Han serves that purpose more. Luke is very focused on his task and you can see how he's trying to hold it all together throughout the movie.

In some ways there are not as many surprises in this move as the first two in the trilogy. It's wrapping up what was said in the first two, especially the 2nd. That might be a drawback to this film. But it's really tense not knowing which characters will make it through to the end. All heads of the river coming to the end as it were which is really fantastic.

In second place would be the emperor. It was a trick role to play. Does he act crazy or in control. Too much and it would seem cheesy and too much might seem to dark and absent for somebody that is supposed to be the leader of the dark side. Once again could you imagine how awesome these would be if they were rated r!

Worst Actor

This is a hard one to pick. I'd maybe pick Leia and Admiral Ackbar. Leia is in the movie a lot but she seems to be missing that edge she used to have. She just kind of goes along with being a slave girl. Later with the ewoks she seems sympathetic almost like she's on a vacation. Maybe Han's making her soft. But it seemed off a bit.

While admiral Ackbar is only a minor role it could have been much more. I would've liked to seen more radio chatter with him directing the big capital ships. And more command people directing what's going on. Just to give a bigger attack scale.

Best Scene

Story wise the best scenes are at the end with Luke & Vader and the emperor. The scene on the radar station walkway and the spire tower. These don't really need to be explained why. But as just a fan of movies I loved the epic space battle. It was so amazing. It still is. Nothing really has topped it yet. And think how long ago it was. Going inside the new death star was a nice spin and it looked amazing and flew by so fast. So many great scenes and moments in this movie.

But now in reviewing this movie I appreciate the Jabba scenes a lot more. They are filled the brim with so many alien characters and details. It's a feast for the eyes and ears.

Worst Scene

When I'd watch the movie as a younger person I thought the Jabba scenes lasted too long. Maybe combine Luke & Leia's story. She brings chewie and Luke sneaks in and they both fall into the ranchor pit. It seemed like the section was too long. Maybe it was knowing as a kid the more exciting, for a kid, ewoks and space battles were coming up. And I could simply not sit still anymore.

Having a longer Yoda scene would've been nice. It was just too convenient to have him die the exact 10 mins that Luke was there.

Hits

    Epic conclusion to the saga!
    Love always wins.
    Best space battle, Ewoks! Did I say Ewoks!

Misses

    Short lightsaber battle. Too much cutting back and forth.
    Lando needed a side-story / mission.
    Not seeing the emperor saber fight."
Ewoks...ugh...and another Death Star...come on
"So by the end of the this trilogy, Han Solo has sort of turned into a boring wuss while Luke has turned badass.  It must have been the ewoks as Luke got away from them as fast as he could.  And those scenes with Vader, the Emperor, and Luke.  How many times can the emperor tell Luke his friends have failed and will die?  How many times can the word ""destiny"" be uttered?  Who was the scriptwriter for this one?  Only redeeming part was the fight scene in the desert though Boba Fett's death was sort of lackluster."
"Return of the Jedi is a great movie, but is the weakest installment of the original trilogy. Yes, the Ewalks are dumb and Harrison Ford just looks bored. I can get over that though because of the great performances of Mark Hamill, James Earl Jones and Ian Mcdiarmid. Also who doesn't like the battle at the end? It is just epic."
"My personal favourite of the original three Star Wars movie. Bold by George Lucas to end such a successful franchise, while adding in entirely new elements into the already successful series. The opening around Jabba the Hutt and the later plot revolving around the Death Star makes The Return of the Jedi multi-layered and continuously entertaining. My only gripe with the film is the excessive use of Ewoks towards the end of the film. The personal confrontation between Luke and the Emperor is also my favourite scene of the series. Would love to know a little more about what happened between Leia and Jabba."
"This one would be my favorite one if it wasn't for the Ewoks. I'm okay with them existing, but when they throw rocks at stormtroopers and win that's going to far. Other than that it's a master peace. The way that Darth Vader and Luke are talking to each other and how Luke almost turns to the dark side is amazing. It has the best light saber light in the entire series when Darth Vader tells Luke that if he won't turn than perhaps she will. And over all it's a perfect ending of the trilogy."
"Compared to its predecessors, Return of the Jedi is underwhelming. The story and characters are good, but too simple and light hearted, especially considering the ewoks. The first act and the scenes inside the second Death Star with Luke, Vader and the Emperor makes up for the rest of the movie, though. Just don't keep your expectations too high, especially after The Empire Strikes Back."
"While not as visually exciting as the two that came before it, Return of the Jedi has some great scenes and duels. And Leia is practically naked, so there's that."
"Almost like the first one with a few narrative variations. Still exciting, cute but a little less intriguing, especially with regards to the oedipal subtext. To be fair, the bar was already too high for this one."
the best of the trilogy
"It's not as entertaining as ""A New Hope"", and it doesn't have any of the darkness like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" either, but I enjoyed it. 3/4"
"The movie would have been better without the Ewokes appearing as long as they did, but it still has some of the best moments in the entire franchise and seeing Luke finally become a badass is worth the journey."
"Not quite as good as Episodes IV or V in my mind, but still an incredible film and a fantastic end to the original trilogy."
"While it is the weakest of the original trilogy, it still has the action and character to keep you invested."
"While not as good as the first two, this should have 100%."
"Return of the Jedi is a fitting end for Luke and friends as he battles the emotional and physical battle of his now known father. This installment keeps the action and emotional depth at an all time high, but seems to add elements of abstract concepts and sub-plots that didn't work as well as they should've."
Uh....Carrie Fischer in a bikini was every kids fantasy
"Great movie and a satisfying end to the original trilogy. Sadly, the Ewoks are a childish edition that's very cringe worthy to sit through. Regardless, Episode 6 still stands out as being one the best in the Star Wars Saga."
Great End to a Great Saga!
"The conclusion to this franchise is what we all expected. We wanted it to go out with a bang and it truly did. From Ewok's, to the showdown this movie still has a ton of action going for it. What is the greatest part of this movie is we still get twists, cliffhangers, and yet again another memorable moment. While you can say George throwing in the Ewok's may have been a foul. I still think that theirs no flaws to end of he Empires reign."
"And so the Darth Vader trilogy reaches its end... In a weird way. The movie continues on the story from the last episode, of course. Han Solo is still ""stoned"" and Luke, Leia and the droids want to get him out of the hands of Jabba the Hutt who is keeping him in his hut. In the meantime, Darth Vader and the Emperor are reconstructing the Death Star. This episode a very comedic tone. I was very confused while watching this with how cheerful and comical everything was. There was so much slapstick and it was very distracting. Also, the way Boba Fett died... Such a weird tone shift for Star Wars... Other than that, I had no major problems with the movie, although the ending felt a bit cheesy. The acting is still great and all the characters are still amusing to watch. The effects, both practical and CGI, were fantastic and at times it's really hard to believe this movie was made so long ago. The Star Wars saga is the one movie that was and still is ahead of its time. The soundtrack is amazing and even though it can get repetitive, it's always amusing to hear the theme songs of certain characters, especially Darth Vader's. All in all, a good sequel with some weird and distracting parts, but an overall enjoyable movie with amazing effects and a fitting end to the original trilogy."
"Although it loses the dynamic between the characters and quite a bit of the wit, it is made up by incredible action from start to finish that does not once get tedious. A fitting finale."
"Now, after the massive success that came with the first two Star Wars films, and trilogy wise after what Empire Strikes Back did to shake up Star Wars in a way where it would almost impossible to come close to the poignancy of, Lucas and next in line director Richard Marquand finish the now called original trilogy to Star Wars with episode VI, titled: Return of the Jedi. To most, this is considered the best ending to the original trilogy while some considered it to be the weakest entry to the series due to the lack of originality (Mainly with a second Death Star being in place and repeating themes and twists from the other films) and also with a safe, kid friendly storyline instead of Gary Kurtz & Lawrence Kasdan's intended ending of the series which would've been more darker and character driven. After a rewatch in preparation for Last Jedi, is it as safe and lacking as some people makes it out to be? Er...yeah im gonna unfortunately say yes. But that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film nor at least a very competent Star Wars film. 

Return of the Jedi in a lot of ways is what happens, in my personal opinion, when you have George Lucas have the keys unlocking the doors of Star Wars that don't need to be opened and as a result lead to some troubles. And while I can't say the Jabba opening (while a bit dragging) had introduced a well done continuation to Empire and showed some impressive practical set pieces, the climatic battle in space has some of the most impressive practical effects seen since Empire, Kasdan's writing for Vader & Luke and their climactic confrontation with the Emperor is the most well done, emotionally conflicted, and memorable moment for the series right next to Empire and Star Wars, and has a great score by John William still (and is my second favourite SW film score ever), the moments of safeness with the Ewoks that played as a important but unnecessarily 'cutesy' distraction to the plot and used really to sell for merch, characters like Han & Leia were more filler for the story than importance and would've definitely benefited from killing Han all together and adding more character driven arcs, some action sequences like the speeder chase where while better during '83 are dated, and a good but really safe ending don't really help propel the conclusion to this trilogy go over smoothly. 

So overall Return of the Jedi plays it too safe but I think had enough of Kasdan's writing and even Richard Marquand's directing to make it a suiting ending to the series, even if this was the clear sign for George Lucas that this would be where his luck and keys to Star Wars would run out. And his mistakes here would be repeated in another set of films after, some of which almost killed the series and made it into a corporate multi-million dollar series."
"Journey to Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens 
Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi - Movie Review 
Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi was simply amazing. The special and visual effects were magnificent and like usual the cast were great like before. The duel scenes between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is one of the most memorable and greatest fights I have ever see. The second Star Wars film is my favorite but this comes extremely close and I don't know it might just be tied with The Empire Strikes Back. The movie was just fantastic
A wonderful conclusion to one of the most fascinating tales ever told. As dark as a tale can be, with an ending that may be happy yet it is very moving. I didn't like the extensive appearance of the Ewoks, but hey, it is a wonderful tale and tales have to be faerie :-)

The plot unfolds well, the already well developed characters stand at the height of our expectations and the special FX help the viewer ""be there"".

Most emotional moment of the movie? The appearance of Anakin's ghost by the ghosts of Obi-wan and Yoda and his sad yet proud glance at Luke. (EDIT: Lucas blew it by overlaying Christensen in this scene; stick with the older versions)"
"has its flaws. i probably would give it a 3.8 if i could but i can't make it a low 3.5 so four stars seems swell. so far, including the new seventh film, it's the 3rd best star wars. what really jumps it up is the emotional scenes in the throne room."
"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi
The final episode of the first Star Wars trilogy, Return of the Jedi delivers an epic finale to the saga, despite its weak plot and overlong duration, Episode VI is highly satisfying."
"An extremely satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy, and in my view, the most rounded film of the three. For me, Return of the Jedi has the perfect balance of the familiarity of the galaxy's landscapes and inner communities seen in A New Hope, and the darker, but nevertheless enjoyable action scenes from the end of The Empire Strikes Back, with the subtext of Luke battling his and his father's inner demons from the 'dark side' of the force. The acting is great, the emotions are stronger, and for me the experience is right as it should be. On to the prequels."
"A-
Take away the Ewok portion and you'll get a truly great and suspenseful movie about the choices Luke Skywalker has to make, how it affects his life, and so on."
"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi [Marquand, 1983] This is where we fall more deeply in love with the characters. 9/10"
Great ending to the original trilogy
"The Ewoks are the only reason this film is not 5 stars.  The cute furry creatures are a buzzkill compared to the serious war fighting environment of this film. They should have been replaced with Wookies. The interaction with Chewbacca would have been neat. Loved seeing Luke come of age and defeat Darth Vader. Han and Leia and the rest deliver non-stop enjoyable action. Outstanding film, great story telling. The Emperor is so hate-able.  Always fun to watch."
"Return of the Jedi is definitely a more joyous movie overall... Of course Ewoks will do that!  A lot of action and comedy, a little serious when Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor.  A solid and aggressive lightsaber battle to finish the film off.  9/10 and probably ranks 3rd or tied for third overall in the saga.  A good closure to the saga... But... There is an awakening..."
"Return of the Jedi is an exciting and satisfying end to the original Star Wars trilogy, though not quite matching the intensity and power of The Empire Strikes Back. The story of Luke and Vader, the Rebellion and the Empire comes to an exciting head in this final film, with excellent moments of conflict and drama. Luke's internal conflict of battling the dark side, and his cries for his father Vader to listen to the good in him adds a compelling thematic and human element to this final instalment, raising interesting questions around good versus evil, and fate versus free will. The moments with Luke and Vader really are the standouts here: their final battle is brutal, raw and thrilling as Luke's inner rage is released, and the final scene of Luke helping Vader in his final moments - as well as the following funeral scene - is oddly touching, and ends the overarching battle between the two on an emotional, moving and complicated note rather than a one-dimensional, black-and-white good overcoming evil arc - which I really liked. Another favourite part of mine is the entire act at Jabba's palace and the escape - it was exciting and super fun, which a Star Wars movie should be. 
I thought this movie had a few problems though; there was a lot of heavy exposition - especially from Obi-Wan to Luke - and the film was inconsistently paced. Also, there is WAY too much Ewok screen time.... That said, the larger story and character beats worked, and the relationship between Han and Leia was at its strongest here. With strong thematic depth, fun action and enough satisfying conclusions to central character arcs, Return of the Jedi overcomes its flaws and is a great finish to cinema's most iconic movie trilogy."
"While the first movie of the original trilogy is the most solid , the second movie the most outstanding , the third movie is a mix of the strongest and weakest moments of the entire trilogy , still for me personally the strong parts outweigh the weak."
"Even though still a great movie, it's the weakest of the originals (Still better than the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones overall)... even though I wouldn't mind it being weak as long it stays strong in the entire saga."
"To me, this is the best of all the films. 

Luke is a better character than Han hands down. And seeing the arc he's gone through is more fulfilling. 

I also loved the amount of space battle. 

And the Ewoks were way too underrated. I loved seeing them topple technology."
"""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of The Jedi"" is the thrilling conclusion to one of cinema's very best trilogy's.  The plot to this movie is that ""Luke Skywalker"" portrayed by ""Mark Hamil"" must travel back to the ""Dagobah System"" and complete his training from ""Yoda"" portrayed by ""Frank Oz"". He finds out that the only way to truly complete his training is to confront ""Darth Vader"" portrayed by ""James Earl Jones"" while ""Darth Vader"" attempts to turn ""Luke Skywalker"" over to ""The Dark Side of The Force"". Meanwhile ""Han Solo"" portrayed by ""Harrison Ford"", ""Princess Leia"" portrayed by ""Carrie Fisher"" and the others bring down the newly built ""Death Star"". The plot to the movie is amazing; the whole deal with the ""Ewoks"" is unnecessary. The scene where the ""Ewoks"" are attacking all of the ""Imperil Storm-Troopers"" is idiotic. What makes it even worse is the next scene. In my opinion the ""Ewoks"" are just put in so the movie makes the two-hour cut. The acting in this movie is not as good as the previous two movies but it is still amazing. ""Harrison Ford"" and ""Mark Hamil"" are still two perfect actors. The music in this movie is incredible. The music that plays during the ""Lightsaber"" battle between ""Luke Skywalker"" and ""Darth Vader"" is perfect for the scene. ""John Williams"" has yet to compose music that isn't stunning or incredible. The special effects in this movie somehow got worse than the two previous movies. Green screens are very visible in some scenes and some characters are very obviously made of some material. ""Return of The Jedi"" is filmed very well but it could've been filmed better, some scenes do look rushed when compared to others. If you enjoyed ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" then I highly recommend you watch ""Return of The Jedi"" as it has superb acting, incredible music and one of cinema's greatest climaxes'. ""Return of The Jedi"" does have some issues those being a few green screens being visible, camera work being rushed and some better directing. I give ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of The Jedi"" a 8/10."
"The final one in the original trilogy, and the one who marked how other Star Wars movies should feel like. 
Takes whats more interesting in the Star Wars universe and avoids the boring parts from episodes IV and V."
"My least favorite of the original trilogy. However, still enjoy this movie. Don't really have any kind of an issue with the ewokes like most people. Now the ewokes are the least of this movie's problems. Only versions I've seen are the original and 1997 special editions. Would definitely recommend to anyone not just the fans."
"An extremely satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy, and in my view, the most rounded film of the three. For me, Return of the Jedi has the perfect balance of the familiarity of the galaxy's landscapes and inner communities seen in A New Hope, and the darker, but nevertheless enjoyable action scenes from the end of The Empire Strikes Back, with the subtext of Luke battling his and his father's inner demons from the 'dark side' of the force. The acting is great, the emotions are stronger, and for me the experience is right as it should be. On to the prequels."
Que se jodan los Ewoks .l.
I think Jedi might actually be my favorite of the original trilogy. Aside from too much Ewoks I feel this one is the most action-packed. The opening sequence at Jabba's is still a lot of fun. And the remastered version adds an interesting spin on the ending.
"Now THIS is how to go out on a high note!

As usual, the climaxes have been pushed further in quality and realism, the battles are beyond dazzling, and the characters are still having a blast with their roles. We even see the Emperor, the only character that Darth Vader himself has probably feared!

And yes, I'll address what people have already mentioned before: The Ewoks.
While I guess these primitive creatures are kinda cute, that's not exactly the first thing that pops into your head when you hear Star Wars. I mean, these critters being put into a setting with walking tanks and lasers being fired in all directions doesn't exactly match up. But it still does a decent job with it.

The space battle above Endor is the best one I have ever seen period! Not only are the effects great, not only does it have some of the most intense reveals and twists, not only do we see an entire Star Destroyer go up in flames, but its atmosphere is just perfect!

Everything is happening all at once in the final climax! From the ground battles to the lightsaber fight! But it's not like some endless cluster of confusion. Here, it works really well.

So overall, this was the conclusion that everyone had hoped for. It once again brings back what we love about the first 2 films and does it again in what may be the best way possible. I'd say go see it, but let's face it. You probably already have."
Jabba the Hut is a boss. Luke is a wiener. Leia unfreezes Han but Jabba catches them. Leia lounges around in a gold bikini. She chokes out Jabba and he dies. The gang is all back together. Yoda dies. Luke finds out that Leia is his sister. They go to Vancouver Island and there are EWOKS and henceforth this is the best of the movies. Luke and Vader hang out. Vader kills the Emperor and saves Luke and becomes good again. He takes off his hat and you see that Hayden Christensen has become The Penguin from Batman. The day is saved and ghost Dads show up.
Given the period - impressively absorbing with some incredible set pieces and storytelling and characters that are second to none.
Long slow and boring it drags on and on but still pretty good
"?So here we are. The final Star Wars film ... until December 18th ... when we finally get the continuation everyone has been waiting for. Return of the Jedi is a very different film from the previous ones. The tone is different. Return of the Jedi isn't queit as dark as The Empire Strikes back but still has its moments of grimness though.
We start with the rescue mission of Han led by now Jedi Knight Luke. This is one of my favorite scenes of the whole movie ... it is a great reintroduction to all of the characters and you can tell Luke has changed quiet a bit and become much more powerful. One of my favorite scenes is after Han is released from his carbonate prison and placed with Chewbacca in a jail cell. Chewbacca is so excited to see him and tells Han Luke is a Jedi Knight is planning to rescue him. Han's line of ""Ive been gone for awhile and everyone has delusions of grandeur"" is so great! It makes me laugh every time.
After Han's rescue everyone besides Luke head to meet up with the rebel fleet. Luke heads to Daygaba to finish his training with Yoda. Yoda is dieing though and tells Luke his training will be complete once he faces Darth Vader. These scenes I always though were boring when I was a child but I love them now and really give the film its most serious moments. Luke finds out that Leia is his sister and is told by Yoda he must train others the way of the force.
After Luke meets back up with the rebel fleet they have a plan to destroy the new death star. Han, Leia, and Luke will head to Endor to disable the shield generator protecting the death star. The special effects are weaker in this film that the others which is kind of weird considering it came out later. A couple of examples are the speeder chases through the forests of endor don't look that great. They have a very fake feel to them even though the sound effects are as great as ever. Another thing that always bugged me were the scenes involving the millennium falcon. There are scenes where Han and Lando are talking in front of the falcon you can clearly tell its just a giant piece of artwork. It looks very very fake.
Once we get to Endor is where i feel the film takes a dip. The ewoks are cute ... i get it ... but you can quickly tell they are there to sells toys to little kids and a lot of thing they do don't make a whole lot of sense. Ewoks taking down one Storm Trooper is a bit of stretch and they take down a lot of them. It doesn't get a cheesy as Gungans but it still isn't that great.
Once Luke turns himself over to Darth Vader and is taken to the Emperor the film picks back up. The last scenes with the duel between Vader and Luke is epic. Everytime they cut away from that scene to show whats going on in Endor ... I groaned a little bit but the space battles between the rebel fleet and the imperial fleet led by Lando where spliced in there as well which helped.
Overall this film is another great star wars movie. Is it a drop off in quality from the greatness that was The Empire Strikes Back ... yes. But its hard to live up to one of the greatest sequels ever made. We get a lot of closure and a great ending to the trilogy."
"WHAT I LIKED: A worthy end to one of the best movie franchises in history - Return of the Jedi succeeds in building up an hour's finale for the franchise to end with whooping heights and touching lows. The journey of these epic characters in this epic world steps up a level in a film where world building is taken to a whole new level, as is the development of the characters we've grown to know and love. Star Wars goes out with a big bang
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The ride isn't as smooth as it's two predecessors, and it takes a little while to get going
VERDICT: An amazing end to an amazing trilogy. This film will always hold a special place in people's hearts."
"Other than Lucas' changes, great movie. This is adulterated version. My 8-year old looked at the hero mirages at the end, saw Anakin as a youth from ""Episode III"", and said ""who's *that*?"" (**) The original would get 5 stars. The pit of the sarlacc should not have Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors, and the death star should not have the ""Praxis effect"". And Han Shot First in ""Episode IV"", because Greedo never fired. But this is how you can find this classic now, so that's what we're left with. [(**) Good parents start with episode IV]"
GREAT ENDING TO A GREAT TRILOGY.... Just wish there was no Ewoks and also that Han Solo storyline in the film wasn't fucked over.... I MEAN SERIOUSLY ALL HE DID WAS HANG OUT WITH EWOKS!!!!!!!.....But other than that the film was great.
"Not As Cinematic As It's Predecessors, But Return of the Jedi Manages To Stand On Both Legs And Deliver The Entertaining Sci-Fi Action The Series Is Known For And Closes The Saga To It's End."
"The film starts and ends with a bang, but a lot of what's in the middle feels unnecessary and dragged out. (B)"
Best one of the franchise! This is what classic films are made of!
"A great, fun classic. An amazing ending to the Star Wars originals"
My favorite Star Wars movie out of the whole saga it ends a phenomenal trilogy with satisfying close. I personally love the special addition changes made in this movie particularly the Max Rebo band. The changes make the movie feel newer and give it more visual depth.
"Eschewing the dark tone of Empire, Return of the Jedi opts for more fun, more character development, and a very satisfying third act.

The first 40 minutes of the movie are really the end of the previous one. Luke and co. have to rescue Han from Jabbaâ??s palace, a good warm-up for the the big fight to come. We then lead into the actual plot of this film: thereâ??s another Death Star, and we once again have to go blow it up. Along the way, we also have to resolve Lukeâ??s daddy issues with Vader (you canâ??t possibly be mad for putting in a spoiler for the previous film in the sequelâ??s review, can you?)

We see a different Luke Skywalker in this movie. Heâ??s more calm, collected, and willing to take action. He has some experience under his belt, too. This is Mark Hamillâ??s best performance in the series: he is not dour, whiny, or apologetic. Heâ??s here, deal with it.

The rest of the cast also gives great performances. Harrison Ford is a master of the reaction shot, serving as an audience stand-in at times. Carrie Fisher also gives a great take on Leia, showing her human side as well as her willingness to jump into the fray. Newcomer Ian MacDiarmid is appropriately creepy as the Emperor. Billy Dee Williams really sold me on Landoâ??s renewed commitment to the Rebellion, and Anthony Daniels is great comic relief, as always.

A fitting end to the trilogy, RotJ concludes the story of Anakin Skywalker with equal parts fun and suspense, with a good deal of meaty character to boot."
"REWATCH. A fantastic end to the greatest trilogy of all time. Emotional stuff from Master Yoda, the Ewoks in Endor unleashes the greatest display of Guerrilla warfare on the Galactic Empire since, 1922's Ireland. Love Jabba's palace and that sneaky little fucker Salacious Crumb, togs creamed with Leia's slave bikini. Emperor Palpatine is a right nasty and manipulative cunt."
"Return of the Jedi is easily my favorite film in the original Star Wars trilogy, and encompasses everything I love about Star Wars. It has memorable and ambitious action sequences, intense emotional conflict and drama, and is both fun and whimsical as well as intense and moving. I don't know how much it's nostalgia talking since Return of the Jedi is one of the first movies I ever remember seeing. I couldn't understand what was going on due to my young age, but the images on screen were forever etched in my memory. Jabba's palace with all its creepy inhabitants, C-3PO's shiny golden exterior, Darth Vader's pitch black helmet... All images that would stay with me and continue to do so almost two decades later. The film builds on the character backstory opened up in Empire Strikes Back and takes it even further, driving the story to the climactic conclusion of the final confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker which is one of the greatest setpieces in cinema history. The music, the dark visuals, the intense emotional weight of it all... It's a climax that is endlessly powerful and utterly unforgettable. Not to mention The Emperor being one of the creepiest ever movie villains making the climax even more intense. I love Return of the Jedi, I love everything about it, and if you have a problem with Ewoks, next time you go to bed Wicket will appear by your bedside to poke you with a stick.

9+/10"
Return of the Jedi is a good final of the original trilogy and it's scenes are more beatiful than it's predecessors making the best film of the saga (my opinion).
"Il film si divide in due grandi ambientazioni che presentano problemi visivi e narrativi non facili da sorvolare, ormai invecchiati nel peggiore dei modi possibile. Nel finale torna nei giusti binari e torna a raccontare l'epilogo del travaglio psicologico del protagonista, soffermandosi su nodi narrativi interessanti e mai scontati."
has its issues but still a great finale
"George Lucas does it again with Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, providing a satisfying end to the original Star Wars trilogy. However, I find that this movie doesn't quite deliver as much as the first two films. My score: 78 ""Good"""
"Not as good as the previous two,but ROTJ is still a satisfying conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy."
"I'm a huge fan of Return of the Jedi, even more than of Empire, just because of the emotion, the Battle of Endor, and a badass Luke Skywalker. Love the Eewoks, enjoyed the entire movie, and cried hard at the very end."
"respects lucas' original vision far more than its predecessor: segmented, aesthetically precise and more philosophically diverse. the film's visual allure is refreshingly not compromised to accompany a grim tone. 'return of the jedi' also embraces a good deal of audience bases - accumulating in a lightsaber duel, starfighter dogfights and a forest onslaught at the same time!"
"Épico final de la trilogía original de Star Wars, emocionante y divertido, excelente para disfrute del quien lo vea."
"The final Star Wars film in the original trilogy is a definitive third and final chapter of what many big film franchises has been defined by. While it's certainly aided incredibly well by Lawrence Kasdan's scripting, helping out with the greater conflict of the Rebel Alliance final battle against the evil Galactic Empire and the greater sense of character development carrying over what 'The Empire Strikes Back' did so well. It's also great to know George Lucas has maintained the film's scope and spectacle, nowadays with a completed back story, the series comes to a complete full circle of the father's rise as a hero and fall to evil as a villain also following the son's heroes journey to redeem his father and realizing the bigger family twists. On another side note the film itself doesn't necessarily reach the big cinematic heights as it's two predecessor's did, even when coming to face the questionable and unevenly toned addition of small furry primitives that eventually help out the Rebel Alliance (then again how is this any different to the Gungans in Phantom Menace). Nonetheless, it's still a fitting finale, that will be continued when come this December, Episode VII or just 'The Force Awakens' finally hits cinemas, then we'll get to see what'll happen after all this time ""A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far Far Away..."" ;)"
The worst film of the original trilogy . As you can see I gave this film a 4.5 because the other two were absolutely amazing . I still liked it . It just wasn't as good as Episode IV and V .
Great conclusion to the Star Wars trilogy (the prequels don't exist) everything was spot on except the ewoks
My personal favorite film. Although it isn't a perfect film it is still has some great moments and is a great conclusion to the trilogy.
"Although the twenty-or-so mites spent with the ewoks feels like an unnecessary tangent, there is plenty of entertainment and drama, particularly in the final sequences, which should be considered among the greatest Star Wars moments."
"The final conclusion in the timeless trilogy that after reviewing recently was as exciting as when I saw it at 10 years old.

The final confrontation of Luke & Vader & all the plot ends are all tied up nicely. It's fast, exciting & all times gripping. It's an epic film that has so much going on.

I'm hoping the next trilogy Episode VII-IX can measure the skill & influence this trilogy had. Takes it rightful place among Return of the King as the greatest concluding film of the trilogy in cinema history."
Now we are ready to see Star Wars VII after watching the other 6
"This Film doesn't get enough attention IMO, I think this one might be my favorite of the trilogy, but I'm not sure I can say that because they're all fantastic."
"Return of the Jedi - the most satisfying Star Wars film.

Full Review: http://imjeffreyrex.com/television-literature-and-film/reviews/classics/classic-review-star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi/"
Excellent end of the second ( first ) trilogy.
"(8.5/10)
While it is the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy when it comes to its story and script, it is indeed the most entertaining of the trilogy. As someone who doesn't adore Star Wars, I understand why people love it, as Return of the Jedi is a solid conclusion to the original saga."
"Return of the Jedi (also known as Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi) is a 1983 American epic space opera film directed by Richard Marquand.. 
The third movie in the original Star Wars trilogy, this continues the action, tension, wit and charm of its predecessor. Although the Ewoks don't always impress and at times seem a little fake, overall it's still a great adventure and a lot of good fun. 
1001"
"I could write a whole book on movies I think are overrated. I always cringe when I see an immature movie (such as Return of The Jedi) get audience acclaim. I mean seriously, Ewoks?!?! I hate those things. The direction is indifferent, the script is scatter shot, the characters are lifeless with no emotion. The story sucks because it's so freaking predictable. Don't let anyone tell you that this is a classic. It's just a crowd pleaser at the end of the day."
"Not as good as the first two, but still very fun and entertaining.
B+"
"While I don't agree with all the decisions on different aspects of how the film's plot is executed (ewoks), I think it does do justice to the characters we started with and acts great as the final act to one of the best trilogies ever made."
"Good finale for a great series. The ending is an adrenaline rush with all the battles happening at once,, however I feel the characters are not as interesting as they were in the first two. Really good way to end a series... or not since episode VII."
decent Movie over all it has a Great Villain aka Emperor Palpatine played by a great actor! the only big problem I had was The EWOKS! I did not like the EWOKS!
The best of them all
"By far the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy, Return of the Jedi does have a magnificent conclusion. 4.4/5"
"Although very corny at times, Return of the Jedi features many memorable scenes, character moments, and one of John William's best scores"
"The conclusion of what is possibly the greatest trilogy of all time could not have ended on a better note. Some of the film's elements may seem a bit sillier and more childish than its predecessors, but it never stops the film from delivering where it counts. Each iconic character arc reaches satisfying and climactic end, and the emotions feel sincere. Although Jabba's Palace is undoubtedly the highlight of the movie, the final confrontation between Luke and Vader is grippingly effective. The newly revealed sinister mastermind behind all of the evil also leaves a lasting impression on the series. 'Jedi' is an epic conclusion, that left people wanting more for what could possibly be until the end of time."
Those Ewoks know how to throw a party!
Return of the Jedi is entertaining and lives up to it's predecessors. It wraps the trilogy up nicely.
Was Good But Not Better Than The The Previous Entry
"weekest star wars movie in history 
and those ewoks killed it"
This film helped make Star Wars the greatest trilogy of all time even though the Ewoks were really unnecessary. God the Ewok's sucked. George Lucas really fucked this movie up. Why not have ended it with a great battle at the Jedi Temple in Coruscant? And don't tell me they couldn't have made Coruscant on film in the early 80's. Look at Blade Runner and the massive city and skyscrapers it had and it is a year older than Return of the Jedi. And Blade Runner's city from 1982 still looks just as good if not better than Coruscant from the Prequels.
"My favorite star wars film for now
97%"
Great ending to a great trilogy. Extra half a star for the Ewoks
"Though it is inferior to its predecessors, Return of the Jedi is a great ending to the series, and they couldn't have made a better conclusion.  The middle of the film is where it doesn't do well, but it's beginning and end make up for it."
"Spoilers Return of the Jedi is the Star Wars movie of the original trilogy where the consensus is a bit all over the place. Lots of people either love or really like this film and I'm sure there a few people out there who hate this movie but everyone seems to admit this film has a few problems. Personally I think Return of the Jedi is a really good movie but it has problems and is definitely the weakest of the original trilogy. However there is a lot of good in this movie. The acting in this film is really really good. Mark Hamill gives his best peformance as Luke of the whole trilogy. Carrie Fisher is really good and she has some great dramatic moments. Harrison Ford is really good yet I feel his peformance isn't as good as in the previous two movies. Bully Dee Williams is fantastic yet I wish he was in the film a bit more. David Prouse and James Earl Jones are again fantastic as Darth Vader. Darth Vader is great in this film, I love how his character is very complex and by the end your opinion on him changes completely. Ian McDiarmid is great as the Emporer, he's creepy, weird and has some silly moments although he's not as over the top as he is in the prequels. This film has loads of great new characters in it, such as Jabba the Hutt, The Emporer and Admiral Ackbar. Those characters are great. Richard Marquand did a good job directing this film, it's not as good as Irvin Kershner but he did a good job. The music in this film is still excellent, John Williams score is brilliant and the end piece is really good but I adore the Emporer's theme. The cinematography is so good in this film and there are brilliant shots in the movie. The action is a bit hit and miss. The Luke vs Rancor fight is really good, it's intense and I love seeing Luke having to try and defeat the monster without his lightsaber. The fight above the Sarlaac pit is pretty good although it does lead to Bobba Fett's extremely quick and dissapointing death. The fight on the Ewoks home planet is alright but it's just stupid how these little teddy bears can kill Stormtroopers in armour with rocks. True I can understand them using arrows to kill the Stormtroopers, but rocks, I just don't understand that. The space battle between the empire and the rebels is great and it all looks fantastic. The Darth Vader and Luke fight while not as good as the one in Empire Strikes Back is still really good and I love the moment when Vader taunts Luke into snapping and exploding in anger, causing him to attack Vader and slice off his arm. While there is a lot of great stuff in the film, there are a lot of problems. The Ewoks are one of the biggest problems. While I loved them when I was a kid, that's the problem, they are aimed for kids. They are fairly annoying and the scene when they are about to cook Luke, Han and Chewbacca is pointless as there is no tension, as its obvious no one will die. Also as I mentioned the action scene between the Ewoks and the Stormtroopers is very underwhelming. Also while I love the Jabba the Hutt section it does go on a bit. The cgi in Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back for the most part still looks great however some of the cgi here looks a bit dodgy. The blue screen in places is really bad. Also this film I feel suffered the most from the special edition changes. When I was younger the bit when the slave girl tries to kill Jabba the Hutt and he sends her down the trap door and she gets eaten by the Rancor used to scare me so much but now it's ruined by the stupid cgi dancers that are terribly intergrated. I hate how Darth Vader now has to scream no at the end. Also Hayden Christensen's ghost appearing at the end is stupid. However I do still enjoy Return of the Jedi, it's a very good yet flawed film. I would recommend it but it isn't as good as the previous two. B+"
"My favorite of the saga!! Return of the Jedi is a truly epic finale to a truly epic trilogy. With great expansions and additions to an already amazing universe. It is a real shame that Return of the Jedi isn't talked about in quite the same way as it's two predecessors, as deserves to be."
"7/10 Wasn't as great as expected, but still worth a watch."
An Exciting End To The Beloved Saga!
"My favorite star wars out of the saga. It feels like a great conclusion to the series.. Oh wait, its not the conclusion.. they're actually making at least 5 more star wars films. well f***, it was a good conclusion while it lasted."
"Not as fun as Empire Strikes back, but amazing"
Best in the series a classic last fourty mins is pure gold
"Even with the Ewoks and Boba Fett's missed potential, Return of the Jedi serves as a fitting finale to one of the best film trilogies of all time."
"This will always be my least favorite one of the Original Trilogy. I always thought the Tatooine Rescue, dragged, and parts of those several scenes could have been better. However the Death Star Two Battle was incredible, and one of the best scenes in Movie History. Contrary to popular opinion, I actually liked the Ewoks. TheEmporer is a chilling Villian perfectly portrayed by Ian McDiarmid. Darth Vader is Fearsome as Ever, but you also see his humanity. I loved that Luke is at his full power here! It is a Decent at best conclusion (at the time) to a groundbreaking cinema changing movie series"
It's lower than the previus two movies but it's stil a good movie.The plot was ok because it made Darth Vader a tragic hero who tangles between his devotion to his master and the feelings for his son.Also shows us the effort Luke does to brimg his father to the bright side of the Force. But one word:Ewoks. Ewoks suck.They made the film look childish.The actings were nice but i didn't like the acting of Mc Diarmid as the Emperor.The special effects were great but for a star wars movie lucks of action.I don't say that it's boring but it was lower than ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''A New Hope''.
There's a lot to endure before we reach the finale in which we get the payoff to The Empire Strikes Back as well as Ian McDiarmid chewing up the scenery in delightfully evil fashion.
A great ending to the original trilogy !
"A great end to one of the best and most popular film trilogies of all time. This movie perfectly wrapped up the original movies while also having great elements of its own, including a great cast and characters, fun 80's special effects, and a terrific blend of fun, suspense, and action. It pretty much has everything I love about Star Wars and is one of the best in the franchise. It's a must-see for fans of Star Wars and Space Opera/Sci-Fi films."
Only issue was ewoks as plot device
A great ending to the Star Wars saga
Not as good as Empire. Goofy elements and poor pacing. Even Darth Vader seems to have lost a lot of his menacing presence. A bit of a letdown after the uncertainty of events in Empire but still has a very memorable climax that's made purist Star Wars fans proud.
The intense final film in the greatest Trilogy Of All TIME!!!!
"I didn't mind the ewoks that much, and don't understand why people make such a big deal out of them. Hey, they are not Jar Jar Binks material, so you people should cut them some slack! 
The movie is not as incredibly strong as the last one turned out to be, but still, a very satisfying, heart racing, thrilling conclusion to the original trilogy which makes it stand on top!"
"So full-disclosure, I think ""Revenge of the Sith"" might be slightly. Maybe. Doesn't mean this isn't a wonderful movie. And it is. Bringing everything to a spectacular conclusion. Once you get past the ewoks (who are just kind of unnecessary, although they're not as bad I remember), Its hard not to smile once you reach the end. Love Star Wars, hell I even love the prequels. I just think its overall just a great story with memorable characters and cool action. I cannot wait to see whats next."
My Personal favorite of the Star Wars saga. Return of the Jedi beautifully wraps up the story for the original trilogy. With beautiful special effects and memorizing characters. This movie is a must see.
"The first half isn't as cinematically punchy as the first two movies (and it just feels smaller as a result), but all the action scenes still deliver, and it's capped with a strong ending.
{after watching the original theatrical version on the 2006 Limited Edition DVD}"
I love how the Ewoks party.
Still think it's amazing!
"Although Return of The Jedi was not as critically well received as its predecessors, the nature of wrapping up a trilogy creates challenges that few, if any filmmakers have managed to surmount, at least in the eyes of the critics. The results for the audience were clear enough however. Return of the Jedi successfully ties off the series in fitting form, bringing the conflict, both personal and galactic, to a perfect crescendo and then taking us on the final journey in a way that felt right. The symbolism, commitment to practical effects, the fine acting and the scope of the film don't falter for a moment, even if it isn't as technically perfect as its counterparts. On the other hand, the entertainment value of this film is perhaps the highest of the series and I remain thrilled by the final battle sequences."
"Although it didn't improve more better, Return of the Jedi is still a satisfying conclusion even if the special effects didn't improve and went one step too far!"
"After the amazing second sequel of SW: ESB, the third could only get better, right? Wrong. SW: ROTJ is the worse of the originals, but I'm not saying it's terrible. It's good, but it is flawed in quite a few ways. No where near as bad as the prequels. The special effects are pretty good and the acting is good, but I found some performances to be a bit weak. The Ewoks are pretty annoying and stupid. They weren't really needed. But it does have another surprising twist, and the action sequences are very good. Not as good as SW: ESB, but very good. It contains one of the best (in my opinion) lightsaber battles of all the movies. Darth Vader vs. Luke Skywalker. It has some emotional parts as well. In conclusion, SW: ROTJ is a satisfying way to end the original trilogy, but it is weak and not the best of the originals."
"Rotj definitely takes two steps back compared to the previous two installments, but this film still is very satisfactory and overall a solid way to end a trilogy."
A fantastic ending to a fantastic trilogy. Minus the ewoks.
"Again, something about the way this was shot feels off to me.  A good ending to the trilogy."
Still awesome but a slight step down from Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
"Despite ewoks, great fun."
5 stars if not for ewoks...
"Although not as good as the other two from the original trilogy, it's still a fantastic and exciting movie."
"For me this is the best of the Star Wars movies, unfortunately nobody stopped George Lucas from digitally ruining it by adding unnecessary whacky details, the movie didn't need. This movie has the ideal mix of self-referential humour, action, and plot development, it is the essence of the 80s and the culmination of the Star Wars saga - by all means."
"still nostalgic. great battles, lots of muppets"
"The legacy of the final film in the original Star Wars trilogy is disappointingly relegated to the position of being the ""worst"" of the three, an oversimplification that dramatically undersells what is an undeniably great piece of work. Much of this results from a small faction of fans' distain for the Ewoks, a misguided piece of cynicism that inaccurately condemns what are, essentially, a perfect example of how to successfully integrate a cute presence that entertains both children and adults (as opposed to, say, the rightfully despised Jar-Jar Binks). When viewing the film as a standalone feature, the list of iconic elements reveals itself to be lengthy; Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine, a series of thrilling space battles, the speeder-bike chase, the rancor, what is most likely the greatest lightsaber duel of the series in Darth Vader and Luke's final confrontation, several memorable and highly quotable lines (""It's a trap!""), etc. Yes, technically it is the weakest of the trilogy, but just barely. It's a satisfying culmination of the series, but it's also so much more than that torpid platitude. It's a gut-wrenching, thrilling piece of cinema that deserves to be remembered as such, even when compared to the absolute perfection of the first two installments."
"This was a pretty enjoyable and or satisfying end to the original trilogy of the Star Wars series. The characters were great and the villains were far better then past Star Wars movies. The acting improved a ton as well as the action. One of my huge and one of my only complaints were the Ewoks. They sort of took away the dark tone to the movie by instead bringing a friendly side to the movie. The only other issue I had was the beginning of the movie on Jaba's barge, which felt a little cartoony at times. Other then that though, this is a very well written and extremely satisfying end to the Star Wars trilogy."
In the final installment of the OG trilogy the amazingly well told story of the war between the Galactic Republic and Imperial Empire is brought to an end in a way that is jaw dropping. Mark Hamill's in his best performance as Luke Skywalker shows how he has matured in his way of the force.
"Luke,Han,chewie,and the new sexy leia are back"
"Skywalker returns to were it all began, (Tatooine) so that he can end it. Final film in the Star Wars Saga. 

*those helmets on the death star, remind me of Spaceballs.
*I did not know the trolls from Ernest Scared Stupid were in this!

Unlike the last two films, New Hope & Empire Strikes Back. This film is driven by elements that are not in it's feature length duration, it is rather driven by an epic story that begun with New Hope (1977) and then essentially continued brilliantly by Empire Strikes Back (1980) and ended by the final half and hour of Return of The Jedi, it did not have it. The Scope and feel from it's original films when it needed it so badly for the last moments of this amazing Saga. A lack-luster, continued finale film instead of another brilliant chapter in the Saga, that seemed to be easily created with the previous films.

The Death Star has been almost restored completely and is close to being much more powerful then it was before. Luke (Mark Hamill) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) and there droid friends, return to Lukes home planet, Tatooine to save Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hut, who's debt was nearly payed back in the Empire Strikes Back, but Luke needed saving.
Luke is now a Jedi Knight, his training with old and dying Yoda (Frank Oz) is finished all that is needed now is for him to face Vader, to become a Jedi Master.
After Leia fails to get Han-Solo out of the den after releasing him from his imprisonment in Carbonite. New and improved Luke Skywalker walks in and outwits Jabba and saves his friends with his new Jedi Skills.
Now the group from the beginning, a long time ago now: Luke, Leia, Solo and R2D2 & C3P-0 and of course Chewie, must fulfill there goal of defeating the evil of The Empire once and for all. The fight has begun it is up to there will to win and Luke's final battle with his Father to decide who will be victorious in the Star Wars Saga.

Something is wrong, something changed, different. The look, maybe the filter or the film they used or a different production team or maybe the new director (Richard Marquand) who has not worked since writing Nowhere to Run. Just of skew, but not destroying the film, but it is noticeable.

When Yoda said, ""There's another."", in this film and Empire Strikes Back, the fans thought he meant Han-Solo, but of course we all know now it is Leia, who has the force like her brother.

Jabba the Hut's scenes in his den were a very sad intro the films last installment, that could have worked if they tried little less on the aliens and harder on the characters, like Leia in that two piece- the lime light was on the poorly constructed alien costumes and if you watched the re-mastered version, that silly frog-singing woman. I know it was meant to be the scum of the galaxy, but they could have made them a little better to look at.

The actors aging in this film may have something to do with its look, but not why it was not as good as the others films. They were not old but aged certainly, I can't wait to see them in the new ones being much older, J.J. Abrams has some work to do.

It may have Carrie Fisher in a sexy bikini, that made geeks and fans around the world even more attune to there fertile desire for there favorite princess, and it has Boba-Fett's last moments before being digested for an thousand years, and the emperor scene with Darth and Luke, that literally makes the film, but there's something care-free that comes across. A dully-like production when it needed to be tighter and bigger then ever in the Saga. A franchise is only as grand and epic as its final moments, although the film was good, it was missing that big, KA-BOOM. A bad space-version of a Spy Kids movie it felt like. A good film, but as a finale film not as great as it should of been. It needed to be great or brilliant like its predecessors."
Ewoks and Boba Fett's goofy death hinder a solid film that still delivers where it counts. Luke and Vader's final duel still remains one of my favorite scenes in cinematic history.
People talk shit about the ewoks but I liked them
ROTJ offers more pleasing visuals and exciting action with a touch of drama to wrap up George Lucas' iconic trilogy.
"The weakest part of the trilogy, but nevertheless satisfying enough. The broader ""love-family"" focus gets out of hand, and softens the plot heavily. All in all it loses a meaningful amount of its ""horror"" and freight, it seems like its made for children."
It is the best film of the first trilogy and with spectacular special effects for the time when it was made. Its the last film of the first trilogy. This film had the most action of the star wars films. People think that this is the last one of the trilogy but in the end there will be a second trilogy.
"A pleasant end to the trilogy. Even so, it was fun meeting the Ewok's!"
A satisfying conclusion to the franchise.
"It has some good parts that are ruined by bad parts. It had some good ideas such as the ambiguity in the start of whether Luke had started to go dark, and some themes in the confrontation with Vader and the emperor. However it was hard to really get into the good parts do to the rest of the film with the silly tone and scenes it kept switching back and forth"
"This film is the weakest of the original trilogy, but still deserves its 5 star rating for its visuals, creatures, characters and climaxing many story details and subplots we were always dying to see figured out."
93% on my Tomatometer.
"Harmy's DeSpecialized edition - 20th Century Fox Fanfare, Darth Vader doesn't yell ""Noooooooo!!!!!!, and Hayden Christiansen doesn't replace Sebastian Shaw as Anakin's force ghost."
"While not the greatest of the trilogy, it provides a very satisfying end with many great moments and characters (not the Ewoks)"
a bit dramatic at times but pretty spectacular
