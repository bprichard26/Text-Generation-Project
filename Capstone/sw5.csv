"The greatest Star Wars movie ever made. Compelling, dark, and occasionally funny. If only the sequel directors would have used this movie as a guide."
"The best of the Star Wars saga. A darker, more serious tone than A New Hope, ESB takes you from one point of the emotional spectrum to the other. And the most infamous 'reveal' in the Star Wars universe."
The movie holds so much spirit and amazement. Even 40 years later the film is still wonderful to watch. Vader is amazing. Luke is amazing. Leia is amazing. Han is amazing. It's fun. It's action-packed. It has love. Failure. Twists. It is Star Wars.
"Certainly better than the first film but still not wildly entertaining. Quite clear that Luke is a pussy. Would be a better film if it was more about Hans and they killed Luke off. And that CP3O as well, just really irritating, should be killed off, Chewbacca is skating on thin ice too, quite annoying. That's the main thing about this series, full of irritating characters."
"Após terminar a primeira trilogia, eis aqui meu favorito.

Mantenho boa parte dos meus comentários feitos no primeiro filme. Sim, ainda é bem gostoso de se assistir - faz-me lembrar das minhas imaginações, quando criança. Há seus momentos marcantes, cômicos e até reflexivos, mas nada que fuja muito do proposito casual, ainda sendo uma experiencia pra alguém que procura um filme pra se assistir em família, como uma sessão da tarde."
Best of all time... obviously seen it tonnes of times!!
A masterclass in cinema.
The best Star Wars Movie
"This the best of all Star wars movies 
I fucking loved everyone fucking evryone should watch this before they die. If You say this movie suck than you need to go to another Galaxy where no one will ever see You again"
Greatest movie in existence.
"Plot twists, drama, teaching..
This movie has got them all."
"the best from Lucas, IV was a close 2nd.. the rest are TRASH"
melhor filme da saga
40 years later and Disney with all of it billions of dollars still can't make a Star Wars film that comes close to this.
"Increible pelicula, y entretenida de principio a fin, vemos a un Han Solo ganandose la simpatia de todos nosotros y vemos el primer gran duelo a sables de luz. Buenisimo el arco de Han y Leia, buenisimo el arco de Luke entrenando en Degobah, buenisimo todo en general, mi favorita de la saga sin duda alguna."
"Great character development. Valuable addition to the lore of Star Wars. Filmed beautifully, and the visuals still hold up better than the prequels even. Beautiful soundtrack capturing the mystique and adventure of the movie. A major improvement on Episode 4: A New Hope."
"What can I say. This is the best movie in the franchise and will never be out done. You don't have to be nerd to know this movie is great. I could watch a whole movie take place on the planet Hoth and completely be satisfied. This movie has many twist and turns that work out wonderful. In the first film we see our heroes meet and fight the evil empire together. In Empire, our heroes are split up and set up with some heavy challenges. The film is beautiful and forever will be a classic."
The Empire Strikes Back is the epitome of Star Wars. From fantastic writing to amazing music and the best acting. Some things have not held up but I do not have any complaints. One of the greater Star Wars movies!
The best movie of all time
This Star Wars is class in every way and the graphics took a massive leap forwards.
"One of the best science fiction films made, and the peak of Star Wars as a franchise."
"The best one in the original trilogy. This an amazing, fun and entertaining movie that everyone will love"
"Empire is the greatest Star Wars movie ever made. An instant classic. The chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford is exceptional. The way they flirt and their behavior towards each other is amazing. I love all the dialogue between them. Yoda is awesome in this movie even though there isn't a lot of him. Every time I watch this movie there is a smile on my face. The acting, plot, just everything about this movie is fantastic."
"The best of the original trilogy and the saga. With a very risky open end for the time and with one of the most famous phrases in the history of cinema. With ""I am your father"" everything turns around and nothing will be the same for the spectators, who are hooked for life to the Skywalker family."
My favorite Star Wars film!
"Spoiler Free: What. A. Movie! There is no doubt that ESB is, if not one of the greatest movies of all time, at least the greatest in the Star Wars saga. The dialogue is amazing, every character has developed since Star Wars in the greatest ways possible. Leia is still badass but is a more rounded out character in terms of emotion. Han is more badass and more compassionate at the same time. Contrary to public opinion the greatest quote in this movie is not delivered by Vader, it is delivered by Han on Hoth before he goes outside the Rebel Base, you know which one I mean. The cinematography is amazing and Irvin Kershner really proves that he could direct a blockbuster that has action and excitement but also great character arcs. Of course we cannot talk about Star Wars without talking about the score. John Williams took all the elements we loved from episode IV and improved upon it, something no one else thought was possible. Yoda's theme at Dagobah, the score during the Asteroid Field chase and of course the famous Imperial March. This movie is everything you want it to be and more. I find no faults in Empire Strikes Back. If you haven't already, watch it, it's a timeless classic."
Pretty much a perfect movie.
"I rewatched this movie last night and it is still a masterpiece. There is so much emotion in the acting and the themes in the movie are as deep as I would expect from a Star Wars movie. Although there are those that may disagree, I would say this is by far the best Star Wars movie ever made."
One of my personal favorites as the story and characters are really played out to their fullest.
The best Star Wars ever.
"ONE OF BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME, MASTERPIECE"
Best movie ever made change my mind
"„No, I am your father."" Is there any more to be said?"
"A cold, action-filled, and shocking sequel that manages to surprise fans of the original with a brand new tone."
"If you loved the first movie, then you'll certainly love this one. All of our favorite characters return; the action sequence in the first 30 minutes and then end is outstanding; the visual effects and CGI are amazing and this movie once again combines action, heart and humor perfectly; Luke is a great protagonist; Darth Vader is an amazing antagonist and I love all the plot twists in this movie especially the one where Darth Vader reveals to be Luke's father. I literally paused the movie and was sitting there shocked. This is the perfect example of a sequel."
A real classic and a must see for everyone. You aren't a Star Wars fan if you haven't seen this one. Disney will have to come up with something truly excellent if they want to top this one! And i wish them good luck with that.
"A bit better than episode IV, but it's still worth watching other films."
The best film in the franchise
"While I personally enjoy it's sequel more, Empire Strikes Back presents powerful emotions, gorgeous cinematography and a truly revolutionary story as impactful as its twist that changed the world."
A dark and riveting sequel where the stakes are sky high
"This is it. The best Star Wars movie. It’s iconic. Hoth is amazing, and the walkers are so cool although not practical. Yoda is hilarious. Luke’s hand gets cut off, and Darth Vader is his father. The protagonists LOSE. I love this movie."
"This is the balance of Star Wars.  This is the fulcrum.  This is Star Wars at its best.  Galaxy spanning. Ad hoc. Beautiful vistas shot gracefully. Success. Doubt. Fear. Failure.
It ensures Luke isn't a Gary Stu/Mary Sue.  It ensures Han has a comeuppance. It shows how few we can trust or turn to. And it shows that running from evil is impossible if that evil is connected to you."
Battle of Hoth is impressive even in the standards of modern technology. How does Lucas do it?
My favorite Star Wars film and the best sequel ever made
Its either this or Godfather 2 as the best sequels ever. Aliens not too shabby either..
"This is probably the most popular Star Wars film. It's one of my favorite movies. This is my favorite movie out of the original trilogy. The story is fantastic. I really love the plot twist at the end where Darth Vader reveals a secret to Luke Skywalker that Vader is Luke's father. This movie has my favorite movie quote of all time which said ""No, I am your father"" by Darth Vader."
la mejor de la saga posiblemente para mi claro
This is my favourite movie from the all Star wars franchise. Everything is just perfect.
"The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel that improves on the previous installment with memorable action scenes, interesting narrative choices and one of the biggest and most iconic plot twist of all time."
"Takes everything from the predecessor... expands, subverts and challenges the audience in the best way possible... this is the definitive sequel"
"This second installment of the original Star Wars movies was pretty good but not as spectacular as the first one. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, James Earl Jones, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot to the movie was pretty good but it could've been better. On the other hand, something unexpected is revealed, which made it pretty interesting. Even though it wasn't as great as the first one, I would still recommend it."
"While it's a big step up from A New Hope, with better action and richer emotion, it still doesn't have what it takes to be great. 88%."
"Not a Star Wars fan, but I still watched it after watching the previous movie of this series. It was great. Finally saw the scene where Darth says, ""Luke, I am your father."""
"flawless sci-fi sequel, one of the best films ever"
"The film is very good, the special effects are amazing for 1980. The acting of Harisson Ford is great and Darth Vader is spooky, Luke is nice but the acting of Mark Himel is average. The soundtrack is fabulous, magical, emotional. It is an great movie, I higly recomend you to watch it."
"THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER. This movie is just pure perfection the story, the direction, the cinematography. It's just pure gold."
"Empire Strikes Back with a dark, unbeatable story that no other Star Wars movie could ever compete with."
"Great movie! One of the best movies ever made. ""Luke, I am your father"" is one of those immortal line, like ""To be or not to be"", and ""Darling, I don't give a damn""."
Perhaps the greatest of the Star Wars series.
o melhor filme da história
Best Star Wars movie. Perfect from beginning to end.
"The most beloved in the franchise for a reason. The characters, the story, the pacing, the editing - they all combine for a top-notch sequel."
"a classic in every way possible, almost every scene it's iconic in its own way. probably the best sequel in the history of blockbusters."
"Empire Strikes Back is one of the only sequels to be better than the original and for great reason. We get to visit a lot more worlds and explore the Star Wars Universe a lot more which is a great change and we are introduced to loads of new and iconic characters (Yoda, Emperor Palpatine and Lando to name a few). The action is pretty great and it has one of the, if not the, most memorable movie lines in movie history, 'No, I am your Father.' The scene is iconic and just overall brilliant. However, Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi are quite unlikable in this film and they just ruin it a bit for me."
"Best movie, just a classic"
This movie might be the best sequel of all time. The Empire Strikes Back is a film unlike any other.
"Although its very few flaws are not unsimilar to those that slightly plagued its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back dazzles viewers so strong with its intensely vibrant visuals and effects that it nearly blinds us to its minor faults."
"Some aspects of the story may be unnecessary, but that certainly doesn't stop the movie from being fun, action packed and emotional. This movie also contains one of the most iconic twists of all time!"
"My hands-down favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy. The dark side has started seeking their revenge after the destruction of the Death Star and Luke trains to become the Jedi master that his father once was.

Enjoyed the higher budget compared to the first Star Wars movie and how the Empire actually wins a few battles this time. Makes the whole ""galactic war"" seem more real.

5/5. I'm sure the other fanboys have more extensive movie reviews for those who are interested."
This film terrified me as a child. It intrigues me as an adult.
Everyone is amazing in this movie
"One of the most iconic films of all time in one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture of all time; it is an amazing film all on its own. Not only does it have the greatest film twist of all time, but is a perfect representation of growth, and honestly my favorite film romance to date."
"Great action, great love story, and a tremendous twist.  This is arguably the best movie in an excellent trilogy."
It's Empire...... Enough said really.
"Some say spectacular, some say masterpiece. There is nothing that makes this a bad film."
"I think that the original Star Wars movie is my favourite movie of all time, but the Empire Strikes Back is in my top 3 favourite sequels of all time. I love it to death. The badassness of Darth Vader and the Empire is what makes me love it"
"This films is so iconic to anyone who is a film fan. From the great use of props to the ability to re watch this film a hundred times and still find something new, this film is a standard for what science fiction films should aim to be."
"The Empire Strikes Back is almost as good as A New Hope , it's the best example for a great sequel."
Probably the best star wars movie ever!
"One of the greatest Star Wars movies of all time. From the thrilling and action-packed Battle of Hoth to the impressive acting and stunning visuals, along with the astonishing compositions by John Williams, this film is a cinematic masterpiece."
Hands down the best starwars movie ever made
"Suggested Audience: Everyone |
Critical Rating: A |
Nostalgia Factor: Insane |
Viewings: 4+ |
Detail: The continuation of the original trilogy, many believe this to be the height of Star Wars. It certainly contains one of the most iconic moments of film during Luke and Vader's confrontation. Every moviegoer should give this a chance."
"Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. It is often touted as the best movie in the entire Star Wars franchise and has some of the most iconic moments in American Cinema history. It is also my favorite movie of all time. I hardly know where to begin with this movie, ESB is everything that Star Wars is and more. It takes the heightened storytelling medium that the original Star Wars exemplified and masterfully complicated it. When you make a sequel to a successful movie, it is often wanted that you will create something that brings the story forward and improves on the world. ESB is one of the greatest sequels because it not only knocks those goals out of the park, but it improves upon the formula so much, that further films would feel so much more like this movie than the original. Where Star Wars was simple, ESB is complicated. Where Star Wars was quick and dramatic, ESB is slower and more contemplative. Where the characters were more archetypical and static, ESB has so much development and change. It is a testament to how good ESB is that A New Hope, one of the greatest of all time, is not the best movie in the Star Wars series. Empire Strikes back has flaws of course, there are underutilized characters, and there are some problematic aspects of the main romance. But compared to the other movies in this series, especially the more recent ones, this movie is near perfect. John Williams's score perfectly accompanies the space opera aesthetic of the screenplays by the late Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. This movie perfectly encapsulates what a Star Wars movie should be. It is the best of the series and my personal favorite of all time. -Rhenn"
"The third best Star wars movie! The story, the civil war, best memorable musics, the lightsabers fight and the surprise shocking truth of Star wars history, all of this was so perfect ! Thanks the Empire Strikes back, it will born of the prequel trilogy as good  films and the special edition is better, respect to the original film of 1980. Another SW great film!"
The pinnacle of sci-fi adventure. This movie hits all the marks.
"Pros: The Hoth scene is just great. Darth Vader is even greater than he was before and the score is the best score in any StarWars Movie. The scene where Darth Vader is talking to the Emperor is great and there is a lot of mystery and it makes you get really invested in the movie. Luke's training with Yoda is some of the best stuff ever in StarWars and Yoda is the best in this movie that he has been in any StarWars movie and that is the same for Darth Vader.  All of our characters(Han, Chewy and Leia are great. When C3PO loses his arms and legs it is funny and fun to watch when Chewbacca has to put him back together. When our heroes go-to the cloud city is a lot of fun and Han didn't know he was walking into a trap and Lando betrays him and you can feel it. When Luke fights Darth Vader, it is a great fight, the choreography is much better and the I am your father twist and Luke willing to die and losing his hand and Han being frozen in carbonite made a great Cliff Hanger. I also like Boba Fett and he had a lot of mystery and I was excited to see him in the next movie.  I don't have anything negative to say about this movie.

I'm going to give this movie an (A+)"
"Aged like a fine wine, this movie is the best in a franchise that is beloved."
"This is amazing! This is the best movie sequel ever! The writing, action, direction, everything in this is amazing! This is a masterpiece. This movie is so good at expanding the works of the original Star Wars!"
"The best of all Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back is also one of the true gold standards for sequels.  Greater drama, higher stakes, and exciting twists -- every element that worked in its predecessor is expanded upon.  Also, Yoda.  We wouldn't see this level of depth from a Star Wars film for another 37 years, with The Last Jedi."
"Those poor rebels, and Luke! Great episode."
A dark turn for the Star Wars saga sucks you in emotionally and adds incredible depth to what could have been another hero-fest.
"As a 14 year old in 1981, I’ll never forget everyone leaving the theatre with their jaws on the floor..."
"MY FAVORITE ONE IN FACT. 
I am your father...."
The best movie of all Star Wars :)
"By far one of the best, if not, the best Star Wars movies made! The action scenes are especially great and the film is all around amazing. My favorite Star Wars and is the best one!"
The best Star Wars movie ever made! #1 out of the 11 to date.
Favorite of the original trilogy.
"Grandiose, thrilling, imperiously generous in scale, and also a bit ponderous"
"Easily one of the greatest sequels of all time, Empire delivers on the action and effects needed in a Star Wars movie, while increasing its depth, and giving us an iconic plot twist."
With an increadible story and amazing historic footage from the 80's. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is impossible to ignore.
the best of star wars!
"Darker, yet very early 80s, and still holds up as one of the greatest sequels of all time!"
"Dark, risky, dramatic, philosophical, entertaining, with impressive action sequences, great effects, with empathetic protagonists, all this makes The Empire Strikes Back to overcome its predecessor."
"9.5/10. If 'A New Hope' defined block-buster filming making, then 'The Empire Strikes Back' was responsible for refining it. This movie took everything that was great about the first one to new heights - the special effects are seamless, the action is gripping, and new classic characters are introduced. Perhaps the greatest improvement comes from the acting and writing. Hamill, Ford, and Fisher have honed their skills and bring emotional depth to Luke, Han, and Leia that wasn't quite there in the last film. The three parallel subplots provide opportunities for each of these main characters, as well as antagonist Darth Vader, to have spotlight moments that do not go to waste. We get to know each of these characters, their aspirations, motivations, and fears, on an intimate level. These subplots weave back together in the final act that will blow viewers away on their first watch, and will continue to be deeply satisfying with every viewing afterwards. The filmmaking and characters have matured, but not without losing the excitement and adventure of the first film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is Star Wars, Sci-Fi cinema, and block-buster filmmaking at its peaks."
"Forget about this movie being the best sci-fi flick of all time. It is the best movie in cinematic history. Hands down. Star Wars literally shaped my childhood, and has had a profound influence on my life as a whole."
One of the greatest movies ever made and by far the best Star Wars movie I've seen it at least a thousand times and my jaw drops at things every time
Greatest of the Original Trilogy. Appealing story and charater development. Amazing action and emotions of Luke-Vader duel.
DONT READ REVIEWS JUST WATCH IT IN ALL OF IT's DARK PERFECTION
"Following Star Wars was going to be hard, and somehow they manage to surpass it and create the pinnacle of the franchise."
A good ending for a great trilogy.
"Very slow to develop, far darker than the other films in the series, & apart from that ""Luke, I am your Father"" bit, mostly unnecessary."
"Good Stuff: The grand Darth Vader is lukes father reveal, The chase scene, Han's character development, the Hoth scene, and yoda.
Bad Stuff: The cloud city scene doesn't feel very… real, also the pacing."
Better than the original. A classic.
"Though I prefer Jedi, this is still a perfect film and a classic"
Amazing I love this film <3
The plot make sense everything about this film is awesome this is one of the best movies ever made
GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
Greatest movie of all time. As in best of all movies not just Star Wars movies. If you disagree you should seek help.
"With some twists and turns and great story telling, The Empire Strikes Back is Star Wars at its peak form."
Outstanding movie my personal favorite and every scene from it never gets old watching luke learn to be a jedi by master Yoda and the connections that I feel with the characters really shows how good this movie is and I feel that I could watch it on repeat.
"Vader at his darkest, the reveal at the end, the Rebellion facing its most desperate odds, and the way this connected the other two films"
words cannot describe how good this movie is. The greatest Star Wars movie of ALL TIME. Period. Introduced Luke to this whole idea of the Jedi world. Introduces Yoda. Shows how Luke is trained. Shows him going through the first stages of becoming the greatest Jedi to ever live.
middle chapter is not as good.
"Somehow this movie manages to be even better than A New Hope. It tells a slower more subtle story that allows us to really get to know our favorite characters. Yoda is a standout, Luke and Vader's battle and relationship are major highlights, and the overall story is the best told of all the Star Wars films."
Best of the entire franchise.
Phenomenal! Just OMG! It's brilliant. Outstanding epic. I ♥️ Star Wars saga. Epic!
Best Star Wars movie
"Hands down the BEST star wars movie of all time, it really advances the hero's journey of Luke and brings all fans together."
"This is by no other word, the best star wars movie ever. The movie does a excellent job at expanding the star wars universe while also developing its central characters and their relationships to a fine degree. Everything the first movie did, this movie does that and so much more. But the icing on top is Darth Vader and you will learn why he is regarded as one of the best cinematic villains in history from watching this. You are truly missing out by not watching this."
Great film in almost every way!
One of the best Star Wars movies ever!
It's great! I don't know what else could I add. Just watch it and see your self!
Most defiantly the best Star Wars movie plot was good and it had a nice visuals and great character development which went amazingly with episode 4
One of the best movies of all time.
Best Star Wars movie... ( maybe tied with ep 9)
"My least favorite of the original star wars trilogy. However, that's not to say it isn't a good movie."
This is genuinely one of the greatest movies of all time but it might get a LITTLE too much hype
"Perfection, this is Star Wars."
This movie is perfect.
"Large-scale, exciting and incredibly beautiful - the fifth episode of the legendary Saga, directed by Irwin Kershner, is the perfect space action, with impressive battle scenes, hero development, a touching love line and unprecedented work on practical effects, in which all the charm of big-budget cinema of the eighties. Whether it's the production, the cameraman's work or the camera itself, it no longer looks like a TV movie, it's a real juicy blockbuster. When I was a kid, I thought that this part is the best, and the delight of this painting did not fade even after a good dozen years."
Top shelf in the Star Wars saga!
"Iconic. Best plot twist ever? #TheEmpireStrikesBack is arguably the greatest @starwars movie of all time. From the memorable beginning to the climatic ending, this one is a classic. You forget how good #harrisonford & #billydeewilliams are in the movie. #starwars 8.5/10"
"Improving itself in a more dark and sinister way then the previous entry, this installment offers the same usual affair as the previous installment with special effects and story but defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels with it's great character development between our leads and offers a great twist that left a mark in film history. Probably the best installment of the entire Star Wars franchise~"
The fairy tale gets new depth and for many it become better. As a child I always found the part with Yoda as boring. It is something I have come to enjoy more as an adult. And lets not forget the shocking revelation in the end that everybody now knows even if they never saw the movie. While I prefer the first movie the difference is really small.
"Best movie of the saga. Incredible story, twists and epics make this a classic. If you haven't seen it already, go and watch it!!"
"The best ""Star Wars"" all times!"
Great story. Timeless.
fantastic. if you love star wars you will love this.
The Sequel that proved sequels can not only be Good but better then the first movie.
The best of the series.
"Best movie of all time. There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. Every single element and scene contributes to make one of the most classic and solid films ever made. I recommend anyone with no matter what film background to give this movie a watch, because it truly is a treat. This is my favorite movie of all time, and there isn't enough words to describe my love for it."
One of the best films of all time and one of the best Star Wars films
My favorite of the saga
It is total masterpiece. Best Star Wars movie and perfect movie as it is without Star Wars!
"A perfect movie. Great character development, visuals, and score."
"Excellent film, its why we like star wars!"
The best Star Wars movie hands down. Every Star  Wars movie is compared to this one. One of the most iconic moments of all film with the father twist.
Best Star Wars movie ever.
"One of the best Star Wars movies ever, and one of the best movies of all time."
The ultimate sequel! The best film of the star wars saga
Feel the force.. Flowing through you
Love the Yoda training scenes the best
This movie is a classic. One of the best in the entire StarWars saga.
"This is, to me, the greatest sci-fi movie ever made."
"Action packed, plot flows flawlessly, epic moments. This movie has it all. This film represents every Star Wars should have always been, but unfortunately more recent sequels have been taken over by the Dark Side."
This is personally my favourite movie of all time
The best chapter in the Star Wars trilogy. Truly breathtaking.
"Empire strikes back is a stunning sequel to the original movie. Excellent writing, excellent performance, exciting, tense, and it has one of the most legendary cliffhangers of all time and it also sets up all character arcs in a very cohesive and relatable way. Empire strikes back is the encyclopedia entry for a proper sequel."
Brilliant - it's easy.
"A classic that made all the people know the saga,  probably the best of Star Wars and one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, powerfully, excellent  and enjoyable in every way."
Yoda! Some slow scenes doesn’t get good until he encounters darth vadar.
"Compelling, action-packed, insightful, and a thrill at every turn. Greatest movie of all time, hands down no debate. Every character and moment shows why people love movies!"
3rd best movie of all time
My favourite movie of all time and my favourite STAR WARS Film
The best of them all.
The best plotted and emotionally resonant of all the Star Wars films.
"I enjoy many aspects of this film; the intro being my favorite. I dislike that it leaves so much hanging and it's honestly an awkward end for me, personally. I love Yoda's introduction, and the battle between Luke and Vader is great, but I prefer their fight in the film after this. Overall, it's a decent enough film, but I personally think it gets way too much credit. It's good. Very good. But it is NOT my favorite Star Wars film; not by a long shot!"
"10/10.
............,"
"Best star wars. No just kidding, best movie."
Fantastic. Flawless. Unforgettable.
Yes! Yes! Yes! That twist is amazing!
"The Empire Strikes Back is better than Star Wars. But, it'll never be as ground-breaking and industry-shaping. God damn, did it sure try though.

Arguably the best sequel to anything ever, 'Empire' recontextualized Star Wars for the better. It took what was essentially a Fairy Tale, and crashed it dramatically down into reality. Audiences in '80 were absolutely taken aback. They expected to be as mystified as they were seeing the original... just not like this. 

Here, Han and Leia fall in love. Lando is introduced. Boba Fett. Force-pull. AT-ATs. Yoda. Vader revealed to be Anakin. Star Wars was forever in the history books, but Empire put Star Wars on the throne of pop culture it still owns today."
An even greater movie better than the original with the most famous line reference that I rather not spoil.
This will ALWAYS remain to be one of my favorite Star Wars films. The anxiety throughout the film is exciting.
Top shelf movie! One of the best in the genre!
"Empire Strikes Back is often cited as the best Star Wars film. Personally, I disagree on the simple grounds that Star Wars was made for kids and as a kid, ESB scared me. All of it, whether the walker attack on Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, or the final confrontation on Bespin, filled me with dread as a child. The love story also didn't help to entice my childish mind.
As an adult, I enjoy ESB the most and it made cinematic history with the greatest plot twist of all times. To this day, new people I introduce to the franchise still don't see it coming and their expression of shock reflects my own when I first saw it at a very young age. One cannot watch Star Wars and not see ESB. It is a must-see for any Star Wars fan and movie-buff."
Very well made classic.
The best movie in the saga.
"Even better than Episode IV, and probably the best movie in the entire saga!"
Perfecta! No hay duda de porque es de las mejores de la saga
Just solo cool❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The best film on the Star Wars saga. This movie has what may have been the biggest twist in films at the time it was released.
Somehow tops the perfection that is A New Hope.
The Empire Strikes Back Is not my favorite Star Wars like most peoples but is still Amazing and as good as a New Hope
Classic sci-fi adventure!
One of the best movies ever made !
"This is my favorite Star Wars film. 

All I have to say is that this film is constantly considered one of the top ten, if not top five, movies ever made, and that's saying a lot since it's a 40 Science-Fiction film.

My Review: A+"
"The greatest Star Wars movie of all time. It takes everything great about A New Hope and pushes it up a couple of levels. This film takes Star Wars into a deep, dark and mature story worthy of any classic drama. Everything, especially the shocking twist, is pulled off with perfection. Another Cinema changer from George Lucas."
"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best sequels ever made. This movie is known for the famous line, ""No, I am your father."" Besides, the story is well written, the special effects are over the top amazing, and the new characters like Yoda is impressive. Overall, The Empire Strikes Back takes the Star Wars franchise into a whole new level."
Best of the original trilogy.
Star Wars at it's best. Incredible movie.
The best of the the original trilogy and even the whole series. How well the story is built in this movie is so good. The story plot and Directing is really what stands out here. Although it's special effects are from the 80's it's story is timeless
"The greatest Star Wars film that will be ever be made!!!! Hands down. Everything that people loved about A New Hope, this doubles everything, its more dark, more action packed, more tense, more emotional, the writing is better..... everything is better... considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest sequel ever made, Empire Strikes Back opens more to the Star Wars universe by starting at the battle of Hoth then moving on to Lukes training at Dagobah with Yoda then Cloud City with the rest of the crew.... then moving on to a much better lightsaber battle... which leads to the biggest movie plot twist and the greatest cliffhanger ever in film.... involving Darth Varder... this is my favourite Star Wars film ever made and it is my second favourite movie of all time... everything that I love about Star Wars comes from this film. It's just a masterpiece of a film for me there's nothing wrong with this movie what so ever!!! That's how great it is......"
easily the best star wars movie ever. A classic even to this day
"Yes, they striked back okay."
very good and a good story and acting
"""No, I am your father!"""
The best film in Star Wars Saga
Best of the OG trilogy
"A perfect movie with great character moments, thrilling action, and some of the most iconic lines and scenes in movie history."
"Considered one of the best sequels of all time, The empire strikes back proves to be an exhilarating film emotionally. This film dives deep into Luke's development through training and self control. This film is not better than the third installment but it holds up as being one of the best."
"So there is an homage to Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz: a lady in braids, a big fuzzy toothy being, a tin man all pulled apart. Is Luke the scarecrow and Han Solo Toto?"
"So many iconic moments! By far the greatest sci-fi movie ever, and the greatest movie ever to me. The way Lucas expanded on the universe he created, the drama, the laughs, the wiseness of Yoda, Empire has everything"
"One of the best films ever made. A near perfect film. It sets the bar so high, especially for Star Wars, that it may be impossible to ever top."
Best star wars movie out there
The best one in the saga
Luke Skywalker trains to become a Jedi in the next chapter of the Skywalker Saga!
perfect in every way
"The second installment to a masterful saga. This film needs no words; it lives up to the expectations put upon it, and then some."
Perhaps the single best movie of all time.
Perhaps the 2d best sci-fi movie ever made.
Una increíble película que tiene un gran grupo de protagonistas y villanos q te enganchan
"THE best of the original Star Wars trilogy!  A dark, bold, exciting adventure (and spiritual lesson) that, despite a somewhat bumpy start (the first time I watched it), never fails to entertain, and exceeds its incredible and classic predecessor."
This is by far the best Star Wars movie!
A movie that can't be made any better. To this day it amazes people with how it emotionally grounded the characters of this universe. This is the pinnacle of Star Wars films and the best the franchise has to offer.
This movie sums up the original triolgy perfectly
Probably my favorite film of all time a long with A New Hope.
"The best of the original trilogy has plenty of Han Solo and Leia, the most famous movie scene in history, and yoda"
"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of how to make a great sequel for a great movie. Dark, adult and more dramatic than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best science fiction films of all time, winner of two Oscars this film is considered by many to be the best in the Star Wars saga. Also in this film there is the biggest twist in the history of cinema and the greatest quote in history
 of cinema: ""I am your father."" It is also the first film in which Yoda appears. Really a great movie, I recommend it."
Greta movie.  I really enjoyed it at the time and still do.
"Darker and more creative, the different stories has lead to fantastic ending with the best quote/twist in cinema history. While giving every character time to shine and show their specular action."
The Best Star Wars movie of the entire run.
"One of the best sci-film ever made or one of the best movie ever made.  Watched this movie way back in the early 80's not knowing the great reveal.  Back then it was a shocking revelation.  How could that be?  You could not wait to see the follow up movie.  How the suspense was built and the development of the characters were great story telling and film making, truly a masterpiece."
What can I say that hasn't already been said?
"The best sequel ever. It builds, it adds, but most importantly it is unique in its own way, while elevating Star Wars to a new level of storytelling."
Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is even better than the first! Amazing!
"The beat film of the original trilogy. The AT-AT storming the ice base is truly epic, and reason enough to watch this movie. Luke's journey takes a very unexpected turn! Classic."
Action and suspense draws you to what is Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back
"Everyone in this movie sucks.  Luke Skywalker sucks, Yoda sucks, Darth Vader sucks, Han Solo and Chewbacca suck, C-3PO sucks, Leia sucks, Lando sucks, R2-D2 sucks -- this movie is overflowing with losers and lame-o's who suck.  Hi, my name is The Hunchback Aguinid and this is my review of Star Wars: Everyone Sucks and The Empire Strikes Back.  Luke Skywalker is a big hero to generations of men and maybe two or three women around the world, but... he sucks!  Within the first 45 minutes of this movie, he gets whomped by a Wampa, almost gets eaten by the Wampa, almost freezes to death, and crashes twice: once when fighting an AT-AT and then upon arriving at Dagobah.  Whoa, Luke!  Slow down! That's way too much sucking and the movie's not even half over yet, buddy!  Luke does nothing but disappoint Yoda during his Jedi training and disobeys both Yoda and Obi-Wan to rashly attempt to rescue Leia, Han, and Chewbacca from Vader.  Then, Luke gets his hand chopped off and, in the film's most unintentionally funny moment, hilariously cries out, ""No! No!""  when he finds out Vader is his father.  The movie ends with Luke himself needing to be rescued because he failed miserably at rescuing his friends and fighting Vader.  Luke Skywalker sucks.  Yoda sucks, too.  Witness Yoda's lame-ass, loser, no-can-do attitude when Luke shows up for Jedi training: Yoda whines that he can't train Luke because Luke is impatient, too full of anger, not focused enough on the present, reckless and too old.  Just minutes later in the film, Yoda hypocritically chastises Luke for having a no-can-do attitude: ""That is why you fail.""  Yoda, the great Jedi master, can't even control his own pupil and watches as Luke rashly leaves to face Vader alone.  It's no wonder Yoda ran from the Emperor and Vader and cowardly hid in a jerkwater swamp instead of fighting them: Yoda sucks.  Vader sucks, too.  He fails to carbon-freeze Luke and bring him to the Emperor.  Vader resorts to telekinetically pelting Luke with random objects during their light saber duel since Vader can't win fair and square.  Vader is a terrible, sucky leader who constantly kills his subordinates when they fail him.  This is a bad way to lead: a good leader should inspire and uplift.  Did it ever occur to Vader that the reason all his subordinates suck so much is because he sucks?  A fish rots from the head down, as the saying goes.  Furthermore, Vader fails to retain his prisoners, Leia and Chewbacca, and loses them to Lando.  Vader should have Force-choked himself to death for failing his own damn self!  Darth Vader sucks.  Han and Chewie suck, too.  Their lame-ass ship, the Millennium Falcon, is in a constant state of disrepair and never jumps to hyperspace when needed.  Why can't Han and Chewie keep the Falcon running right?  Oh yeah, it's because they suck.  Han gets suckered by his old pal Lando and ends up getting captured, frozen, and carted off to be killed, molested, or eaten by Jabba the Hutt.  Han is so stupid he flies himself and his friends right into the mouth of a giant space slug!  Han Solo sucks.  C-3PO sucks, too.  All he does is whine, whine, whine, much like Luke.  Leia sucks, too.  In spite of the fact that she is a Skywalker and has the potential to use the Force (which is why Yoda and Obi-Wan say Luke is not their only hope), she serves no purpose but to be the love interest.  Yoda, Obi-Wan, Vader, and the Emperor think so little of her that they only focus on Luke.  Leia also plants a big, wet kiss on her own brother's lips.  Yuck!  Leia sucks.  Lando sucks, too.  He loses control of his operation on Cloud City to the Empire, foolishly makes a deal with Vader and gets screwed over in that deal by Vader, is forced to betray his old pal Han, and almost gets the life choked out of him by Chewie.  Lando sucks.  R2-D2 sucks, too.  There's a saying that you are the average of the people you choose to hang around with.  Well, who does R2-D2 hang out with?  Sucky losers like C-3PO, Luke, Han, Chewie, and Leia.  Ergo, R2-D2 sucks, too.  In conclusion, the Empire Strikes Back is widely regarded as one of the best movies of all time and the best of the original Star Wars trilogy, but, in truth, everyone in this movie sucks.  [P.S. The Rebel Alliance sucks because even though they destroyed the Death Star, they are on the run again from the Empire.  Luke and Han's tauntauns suck because they get killed.  The Wampa sucks because it gets its arm chopped off.  The giant space slug, a.k.a. the Exogorth, sucks because it failed to digest Han, Chewie, Leia, and C-3PO. Obi-Wan sucks because he gave up during his fight with Vader and let Vader kill him.  The Imperial officers who get Force-choked to death by Vader suck because they failed and got Force-choked to death.  See?  Everyone sucks in this movie.]"
"great film, although i would say a bit overrated by many"
"The intro to this movie really sets a standard that it just doesn't seem to live up to. The intro is fast paced and epic, but then the middle has a lot of training, hiding and waiting, which is not always the most entertaining thing to watch. The end is good but incomplete as they were busy setting up their final film and at that point it is hard to reinvest as you've most likely tuned out during the dull middle. Not as good as everyone says, but necessary for the trilogy, and by no means unwatchable."
"Dark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back defies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels."
This movie is a timeless classic. Brilliance on screen at its best. We miss you Star Wars
"Usually, sequels tend to be pretty bad into comparison to their predecessor but the second installment in the Star Wars franchise outdoes the original by making perfect, perfecter with great action and a darker tone with great pacing and character development and much more of the main villain, 10/10."
Probably the best movie I have (or will ever) see.  Period.
One of the greatest films ever made!
The best movie ever made.
Definitely the best of the saga. The beloved classic still holds up to with films today.
One of the best star wars films ever
"To be quite honest, I just don't get it. The plot was boring and there was no real substance to it. In comparison to a REAL classic, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it was more ketchup than rotten tomato. Someone please let me know what the plot of this movie is."
Best Movie of all time!
One of the best movie of all time.
This is the quintessential Star Wars film.
The perfect Star Wars movie. Couldn't have asked for more.
A science fiction masterpiece . The greatest Star Wars film of all .
Great movie and cast.  Effects are awesome and story is incredible.
"The perfect chapter in the heroes journey, it is filled with excellent character development that broke new grounds. Even though the movie takes place in a galaxy filled with aliens we can all relate to the characters struggle to find meaning in a galaxy covered by war and darkness. This is the perfect example of what Star Wars can be at its best."
One of the best movies of all time.
Nothing to say other than its perfect
Nothing more needs to be said about Empire Strikes Back. It's not only the best Star Wars movie but also one of the best movies ever made.
"Greatest Sequel to a film ever made. Fun, Serious, Great twist & Turns, Probably the Best Star Wars Soundtrack."
"The Empire Strikes Back is the definitive sequel. It takes everything you wanted from the first Star Wars, and enhances it. Filled with excellent  directing, great acting, brilliant dialogue, gorgeous music, unmatched imagination, and iconic moments that will stick with you for a life time, The Empire Strikes Back is absolutely one of the best movies of all time!"
"Maybe less fun than the first one but definitely much more involving. It cranks up the atmospheric elements of the original to unseen heights and uses the seemingly most effective trick to make us humans believe in something, creating believable humans out of it's combination of sights and sounds that we call characters so the whole space adventure business definitely feels like the real deal here. I don't mind when movies prefer spectacle, visuals and tone over character but if this movie doesn't dig deep into it's characters I don't know which one does, and it's all the better for it, and of course the fact that all of those other visual filmmaking aspects are brought to new heights too. In the original the most interesting human characters were Obi-Wan and Vader, and they are both side characters, while the droids and sometimes the wookie often stole the show from the main cast, here the tables are turned(but we also get a new incredible non human character). It's a movie that leaves you wanting more, but also ends on the promise that you will get that something, and while in my opinion the sequel did absolutely deliver and is autmatically Empire's second half, this might've been the reason why some people weren't as enthusiastic for this one it came out as for the first star wars."
Do I even need to say why?
"Widely considered the best film in the Star Wars franchise I anticipated this film heavily after enjoying Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope (1977) but I have to say it rather disappointed me. Yes, it's impact was lessened due to my knowing all of the major plot beats before seeing the film but I still found the iconic moments to be brilliant and exciting and the long stretches between these moments dull and difficult to engage with. I also felt as though this film was more polished than the first which had some benefits but at the same time sapped the film of some of the charm that made the first film so charming.

Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, becomes lost on the planet Hoth while his friends Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher, and Han Solo, Harrison Ford, attempt to find him before the Galactic Empire descends on them. He is eventually rescued by them but while recovering is ordered by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi to travel to Dragobah in order to be trained in the ways of a Jedi. After being attacked by the Empire, Skywalker does end up crashing on Dragobah and with the help of Yoda he learns how to use the ‘Force' and make his way out of the area. Meanwhile, Solo and Leia travel to Cloud City on the planet Bespin where they meet Solo's enemy Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams, who turns them over to the Empire before helping them escape. The three are eventually reunited and face down the Empire and Darth Vader who makes a shocking revelation. 

Perhaps for young men the sort of thrills that the action scenes in this film can provide are enough to sustain their interest throughout the film but for me this wasn't nearly enough to keep me engaged as the characters stopped being interesting and all of the near misses and light saber fights felt so generic. Sure, if I had been alive in 1980 this probably would have excited me but for a film so widely respected I expected the scenes to still shock and exhilarate 39 years later and I couldn't believe that during an action/science fiction romp I was so indifferent. It wasn't that these scenes were incompetently put together by any means, they were functional, yet they lacked the pizazz and freshness of the fights in the first film where we see an eager, bright eyed young man face off against the most powerful leader in his universe. I wanted so much to be able to cheer as our three heroes narrowly avoid death but I just wasn't as invested as I had been in the previous film as the sight of two computer generated colorful lines smashing into one another did not arouse excitement in me.

The section of the film that should have been of the most interest to me, the romantic subplot between Solo and Leia, failed to set fire as while Ford and Fisher have decent chemistry the dialogue they work with is cliché. Without any of the fun of It Happened One Night (1934) they play two characters who are clearly in love with one another who refuse to admit this fact. Sometimes the snappy banter that this dynamic produces can be hilarious and charming but Fisher doesn't have the comedic capabilities of Claudette Colbert or Barbara Stanwyck and therefore fails to charm us or draw us in with her tough as nails act. As for Ford he struggles as a romantic lead here, an issue he would not rectify by the time he made Working Girl (1988), in addition to relying on sarcasm a little too much in order to make the audience laugh. Add in the fact that Leia kisses her biological brother and I felt rather uncomfortable watching all this play out. Maybe Lucas and his fellow screenwriters should have hired somebody else to write the romantic dialogue as we would see his inability to write decent dialogue in this style ruin the prequel trilogy.

In my opinion this film does not match the first in excitement and youthful exuberance and while it does get darker that doesn't necessarily make it better."
One of the best sequels made to one of the best science fiction films made.
"As for sequels, it is only rivaled by 2 others. As for sci fi, one of the best ever."
While the first film set up the mythology Lucas explores it deeper by turning his space opera into a soap opera. Arguably Mark Hamill's greatest onscreen performance.
Who doesn't love this movie??
Easily my favourite movie of all time
It's the best movie in the wold
It's not as good as everyone says it is. The Battle Of Hoth was awesome and the gun fight at cloud city was so cool and the Lightsaber fight was one of the best but the middle of the movie was boring. Like with Han and Leia running through space and hiding that wasn't fun or cool. And I don't care if this is blasphemy in Star Wars I don't care about Yoda. His character wasn't that cool or awesome he was just there. Learning about the force and ways of the Jedi are very interesting but didn't care about Yoda. It's a good movie but In terms of Star Wars it's my least favorite. Not because its bad but the other movies are so good and it's hard to choose. But somebody has to be at the bottom of the totem pole.
The greatest film of all time!
"One of the greatest movies ever made in one of the best sagas ever made, Yoda made this one stand out just that little bit more than the other flawless films."
The Best Star Wars Movie EVER!
The best of the Saga
"Without a doubt, the best Star Wars movie, combined with Kershner's direction, the script by Lucas, Kasdan and Bracket, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Suschitzky's cinematography, Hirsch's editing, Reynolds' production design, Ford's set decoration, Mollo's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, The Empire Strikes Back stands alone at the top as the best Star Wars movie of all time and without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever put to the silver screen!!!"
This is proof that sequels can match or even surpass their predecessor. This is the story of showing our heroes lose and added one of the biggest twists at the time of telling us that Vader was Luke's father all along.
É o meu filme preferido da saga Star Wars
"Amazing film! I watched it so many times when I was 7 that I know the movie shot for shot. It's got everything you want; Harrison Ford at his best, Yoda, the terrifying truth of Darth Vader, Yoda, that epic battle on Hoth and Yoda. Enough said, masterpiece."
"Absolutely the best of the original Saga, highly recommended"
"What Luke learned in swamp world? Nothing. Waste of Time. Han hide in asteroid field until script needed him to get out so that Luke have reason to leave swamp. Lazy movie. Instead of Han hiding in asteroid field, he could go over galaxy  to convince others to join rebellion with Leia, but no."
The Empire Strikes Back is the 2nd best of the Star Wars Franchise and one of the best films ever made.
An absolute classic. The very best of the Star Wars saga and one of the greatest of all time. 10/10.
This is the best Star Wars movie ever and the best Sci Fi movie of all time nothing can beat this
"Dark, dramatic, and intense, The Empire Strikes Back is an awesome movie, and my personal favorite in the Star Wars series. The Battle of Hoth is my favorite battle in the series, and Luke's lightsaber duel with Vader is creepy, thrilling, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This film also has one of the best movie twists ever with the iconic, and often misquoted, line from Vader: ""No, I am your Father."" A+ 100/100"
This movie was awesome it by far is the best Star Wars film and this is what makes Star Wars a great franchise before it got ruined by Disney
Just as good as a new hope.
this is the best star wars movie ever made. along with revenge of the sith and a new hope and the force awakens and the upcoming star wars movie.
It's even better than the first film. It's like the first film but everything is improved and a lot darker.
"This movie has everything you need in a movie. It has adventure, romance, drama, good vs evil at its peak and the ending will blow your mind."
"This movie is arguably the best in the whole Star Wars saga! It had action, suspense, and everything you'd want from a movie! This movie is one of the greatest movies ever and is the best out of all the originals. The characters were expanded upon even further than in A new Hope and made you feel connected to them. If you somehow haven't seen this movie you are missing out on and amazing film. The shock value if you haven't seen it is very good. The romance in this movie is pure and authentic and it seems natural and not forced. Darth Vader was an awesome villain and definitely one of the best if not the best villain of all time! This movie is nothing short of great and it is a must see movie!"
"Arguably the best Star Wars film, and once again one of the best films ever made. The Empire Strikes Back proved Star Wars a force to be reckoned with, by not pertaining to the sequels of its time and building on the story, characters, and plot. Giving us a darker, fun, adventure filled film that exceeded its predecessor and gave us even more classic film and Star Wars moments."
"Those that love Star Wars, know this is the best of all the movies"
The BEST SEQUEL in film history bar none!
"What can I say? This movie is a must-see. A reference in terms of the middle part of a trilogy, never equaled since.Clear motivation for the characters, incredible and story-shaking plot twists, while conveying all the emotions and tension you can expect from a well-told story. Just don't expect a happy ending !"
"Its one of the best films of all time. Really enjoyed the atmosphere at Central Cinema! If you havent been there, go check it out!"
"With all the fame given to Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back surprisingly entertained the audience more than its predecessor!"
Best Star Wars movie!!!!
Why is this so f**king fantastic I absolutely loved this movie I 100% definitely recommend it this gets an A+
A dark and philosophical follow up to the first episode. This epic piece extends on its predecessor with deepened characters and lore as well as bringing in more soap type elements.
Another masterpiece of work
"STAR WARS: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is easily one of my most favorite films of all time. Kirshner, Brackett, and Kasdan perfectly capture the ever so illusive quality of timelessness with all three films of the original trilogy, but because of the dark and mysterious tone of Empire, this one takes the cake as being the best film of the three. Mark Hamill plays Luke beautifully, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford portray a convincing love story between a scoundrel and a princess, and the real set pieces used in this film are just as realistic and detailed as any in history. The original score is to die for, as with most STAR WARS films, and the filmmaking techniques utilized by Kirshner (lighting, depth, etc.) are top notch. Not to mention that the ending of the movie brings on one of the most unexpected plot twists in the history of cinema, one that still shocks audiences today.

Overall, I could go on and on about how incredible this film is and what it means to me, but the only other thing I will say is to go and watch this movie if you haven't already. Go back and watch it again if you've already seen it."
This movie is way better than the first in the beginning it just goes straight into the action this was movie was amazing fun and exiti
This is easily in the top ten movies of all time. An instant classic.
The best movie of one of the franchises of all time
"This is my favorite Star Wars movie. It has a good plot, and unexpected twist, and just enough action."
"Absolutely amazing acting and action with a neat story that ties all of it together. For an 80s movie, the empire strikes back was way ahead of its time."
"Upping the effects and stakes, the film expands the galaxy and takes in in a darker direction, yet there is still hope. Undoubtedly, it is the greatest movie sequel ever made."
"There are many that make the argument this is the best Star Wars movie to date. It is certainly the greatest sequel of any science fiction movie, that is without question. However, without the source material this movie would have never happened. So I can only praise it to that point. This movie drew the template for saga expansion that almost no one has followed (notable exception - Aliens 1986)."
"A perfect film. Dark, gritty and moving. Ford' s best performance in the original trilogy. Billy Dee Williams adds a lot to the film."
"The Empire is not only the best film in the series, but also the best science fiction film of all time, and my all-time favorite!"
"One of the very few movies in existence that break the ""sequel's suck"" mold.  The original Star Wars movie was incredible, but Empire is far and away my favorite."
My favorite Star Wars movie by far!
"This movie takes everything great about the first one and expands on whilst adding it own things to the franchise like introducing us to Yoda, boba fett, lando calrissian and force ghosts whilst giving us the shocking reveal at the end whilst giving us hints of it throughout the movie and ending on a cliffhanger making you beg for more. Star wars: the empire strikes back absolutely deserves a 10/10 it is by far the best film in the entire saga"
Falcon is not small ship to survive asteroid field and like that mean nothing. Same like in ep4 where falcon helps luke and no one on Death Star shoot on him. Falcon is not small one man fighter to evade fire. Rest of movie was also bad. Middle and last act was horribleFalcon is not small ship to survive asteroid field and like that mean nothing. Same like in ep4 where falcon helps luke and no one on Death Star shoot on him. Falcon is not small one man fighter to evade fire. . Middle and last act was horrible
Excellence in film making. One of the greatest movies ever made.
I dont see what is so special about TESB. I could never watch any of OT in single viewing. Ep2 was far better in all aspects
The best Star Wars movie of all time
Very boring. I would rather watch flash gordon
"Rebel have good X-wings and Y wings and yet when attacking AT ATs, they use weak speeders. Middle act was awful and lameness that only two characters in entire galaxy have lightsaber"
"Not only the best Star Wars movie, but one of the best movies ever created!!!"
Iv'e given this 5 stars for being the best movie in the series.  Sadly I have heard some claim that tons of people hated this film back in the day.  That is false I don't recall anyone showing hate for it.
The best Star Wars movie. An spacial ride from the beginning to the end.
The best film of the saga!
This movie will be an eternally remembered masterpiece.
BEST STAR WARS MOVIE OF ALL TIME
This sequel takes every good thing from the last movie and actually builds on it.
star wars what can we say
"A perfect story, perfectly developed characters...Perfect passing. The Empire Strikes back contains the sustained Star Wars Magic and will leave most (including me) fans/viewers thrilled."
"This is now the 26th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes Back and I can say that it was as good as the first time I saw it.

Star Wars: Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes Back is the 2nd Star Wars film to be released in cinemas and the 5th Star Wars film in the Skywalker story line. The film wasn't directed by George Lucas, but instead directed by Irvin Kershner. The film stars Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and David Prowse/James Earl Jones as Darth Vader.

The acting in my opinion improves on the 1st film, but still isn't on the level of The Godfather. I also Personally really liked Mark Hamill as Luke in this one, I felt that he fit the character as perfectly as anyone ever could.

The characters in my opinion like the first film are some of the greatest characters from cinematic history. From Luke to Darth Vader the characters are memorable and portrayed really well. This film also adds more iconic characters to the mix like Master Yoda and Sheev Palpatine.

The film also had some very strong cinematography with some great shots of the characters and scenery.

The settings in my opinion also improve on the 1st film by adding planets like Hoth and Dagobah into the mix.

The set designs and props are done exetremely well from the planets designs to the various weapons and machines.

The costume designs and makeup are also done really well especially with Darth Vader and the Snowtroopers.

The practical effects like the 1st film are done incredibly well from the puppets to the models.

The action in my opinion is really strong especially the duels between Luke and Darth Vader.

The dialogue also improves on the 1st film with even more exetremly quotable dialogue.

The music also improves on the 1st film by having one of the greatest villain themes of all time Imperial March.

The story I personally love from the beginning to the end. The story is done really well and is extremely entertaining to watch fold out.

The comedy in my opinion also works very well especially with the characters Han Solo and Princess Leia. 

The film at points also had some really strong atmosphere especially with Luke and Yoda on Dagobah.

I Personally think that the film is one of the most enjoyable films that I have ever and will ever watch.

Over all I give it a 
10/10
100%
5/5

In my opinion this film is the meaning of nostalgia"
"The Empire Strikes back is better than A New Hope on every level. The characters are even more fleshed out, it has better pacing, more interesting mythology, and boasts better effects."
"No matter how hard they try to recreate the Star Wars saga, they will never be able to top The Empire Strikes Back!"
"I looooooove this movie sooo much, the greatest sequel of any movie ever. The plot twist is amazing, most of the effects still hold up to this day, and the cinematography is some of the best in science fiction."
Best boi of all time
"The perfect sequel. Only adds to the mythos and John Williams' score is even better. If a movie can be perfect in my personal opinion, it's this one. The special effects of the time are perfect the performances are perfect."
"A true masterpiece, Episode V is the perfect sequel. It continues the adventures of our favorite heroes while introducing new fan favorites such as Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett all while improving upon 1977’s “Star Wars” by delivering a gripping story and the greatest twist in the history of cinema."
This is definitely the best Star Wars movie. Loved the focus on Luke's struggle and the legendary meet between him and his father.
"I haven’t seen this movie or any Star Wars movies I’ve just heard sm good things, so why not do a random 5 star review lol"
Amazing how it was filmed in 1980! George Lucas did an amazing job there!
The best of the best
Masterpiece. This is Star Wars peak. One of the best Sci-Fi flicks out there!
Perfect sequel for a perfect movie.
This is how you develop the rise of a character. How you build a hero and make it learn from hasty decisions and make it root for him and also for the villain. Incredible directing and a perfect story.
"Great movie for what it is, and so iconic."
Best star wars film to date
My favourite of all the saga.
Greatest movie sequel ever.
"When I used to have all three movies and decided to watch one, this was the one I was most often picking put in the VCR. The battle on the ice planet Hoth, emergence of Yoda, visit to the cloud city of Bespin, the fight with Vader...memorable and exciting."
"fantastic. this is my favorite film of the star wars franchise. it's fresh, and brillient."
incredible and perfect movie
"Like its predecessor, this movie is not only the gold standard for Star Wars but also the gold standard for filmmaking. This movie is not only the greatest Star Wars movie of all time but the greatest movie of all time. Grade: A+"
"The best sequel of all time, with best twist of the cinema history"
"La sceneggiatura è discreta, la recitazione è discreta. La regia è discreta; la colonna sonora è perfetta; il buon J. Williams non delude MAI! Voto: 6"
"The best Star Wars of the series, writer Lawrence Kasden become my favorite writer."
Somehow even better then it's predecessor. The best Sci-Fi adventure of all time!
"Classic and essential. If you get the chance, listen to the commentary track with director Irvin Kirshner and Carrie Fisher"
Absolute perfection. We will never see its equal.
"This is my favorite film of all time, it was George Lucas at his best. All-star cast too."
"This is my all time favorite movie, it has my all time favorite scene (I am your father), and I'm not sure I can find anything bad to say about it."
The best star wars ever
what can you really say about the best SW film...
"VERY CLOSE to being the perfect sequel known to man, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK expands its fresh universe with consequential tenebrosity,  intensified mythology, and investing character spectacle with ultimate risks. This film got us more involved in its landscape. So involved to where I was pretty frustrated at how the film ended. The film, simply put, looks so BEAUTIFUL from a technical stand point. Beautiful is not even the word. The writing is cohesive, the conflict is quite scary, the romance is complicated in a sense, and the overall feel of the film is like no other. It's like a collage of different emotions put into to one film. There is so much to marvel and gaze at while watching The Empire Strikes Back. It is the BEST STAR WARS FILM ever made, in my opinion. It is also another one of the greatest films of all-time, with a clear message about a broken lineage and its haunting past."
The Empire Strikes Backs is one of the greatest Science Fiction films in history.
"Best starwars movie of the 6 movies and I say 6 because I only count those made by George Lucas.

If you never watched starwars before, watch from episode 1 to 6 then stop. Everything else after that is ruined by Disneay"
"Brilliant from start to finish. George Lucas’ second installment in the Star Wars saga bats 1.000. This exceptionally well-balanced and entertaining film makes a galaxy far, far away seem so close to home with its realism and character development. This truly deserves to be in the discussion for “the greatest film of all time”."
My least favorite of the original 3 movies. Yet millions of times better than anything done by Disney.
The rating system needs more stars for this one :)
"No dispute, this is the best of all Star Wars movies thus far."
"A work of art, a masterpiece. Probably the best movie of all time. The scenes on Hoth, the fight between Luke and Vader, it is just amazing"
This is how you make a sequel.
"Second best movie of all time, right behind A New Hope."
"Everything a sequel needs to do: continue its story, add more to its lore, take the characters on a dark and suspenseful journey, add few but everlasting characters to the already lovable cast, and up the special effects. One of the best films ever made, no doubt."
"Mark Hamill , Harrison Ford , Carrie Fisher and many others returned for another dazzling heartwarming space adventure with an action packed plot and a shocking plot twist that changes everything."
"It just keeps getting better with age. They certainly don't make them like this anymore. People weren't even criticized for watching this movie ""wrong""."
"For my tastes, this is far and away the greatest movie of the Star Wars franchise - the rare sequel that surpasses the original."
"It's just too good. Why can't Disney do this? Oh yeah, there's no passion in Disney any longer. It's just about the money for them. Anyway, back to my review...best original trilogy movie ever...bye."
Still an impeccable film 39 years later that only contributes to a trilogy like no other.  Truly a timeless classic
The movie of all time
The best Star Wars movie of all time.
My favourite film of all time.
One of my favorite films. It takes everything from the first Star Wars and kicks it up a notch.
One of my favorite films. The best of the original trilogy and one of the greatest films of all time.
The greatest movie twist of all time and is arguably better than the original.
An excellent sequel in a phenomenal trilogy. This film provides a great story with solid character development and very good visuals for the time.
Best movie of all time.
Genre defining. Its playful and engaging with great world building. Some of the scenes seem silly but that adds to the charm. All the made up props and back story add together in a really nice mix. It's why I imagine so many wanted to be part of this world. Writing their own stories and buying toys. It doesn't seem flashy or goofy.
Cinematic perfection.
This is not only a great star wars film. This is a great Sci-fi film and a great film in general. Lovely sets. Great characters and a great example of a sequel.
Best STAR WARS movie out there. Has no equal. Truly sensational.
Classic Star Wars.....and very dark!
"One of the best Star Wars films, Lucas knew how it was done. Unlike Disney, those cretins."
"My favorite Star Wars movie - extremely well put-together, with tons of character growth, wonderful effects, and exciting mythology.  Simply the best."
best sw movie ever made
The best Star Wars movie! This film is an utter masterpiece of cinema!
"Most people will say this is their favorite Star Wars movie, it is not a bad one, but it is not my number 1. The story is good, good actions scenes and I like the characters introduced. Its an overall good movie but some of the acting is a little cheesy."
Best Star Wars movie!
This was and will always be my favorite film of the series.
Best Star Wars movie ever
Tops my own personal star wars list as best film
Itï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s a classic what more do I have to say
best movie I've ever seen. Nothing has changed since 1989 for me..
"One of the best, if not the best sequel ever made, hands down. By expanding the world and diving deeper into each of its principle characters, The Empire Strikes Back remains the most morally and metaphorically complex film in the Star Wars saga."
"Really a classic movie, a childhood staple, only good memories."
"This is my 2nd all time favorite star wars movie after revenge of the sith and now that i added 5 out of 5 stars for this film, there's really nothing more i need to say"
"Greatest Star Wars film ever made! Even better than Episode IV. The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece! A timeless classic. A legend in film history. My absolute favorite Star Wars film. One of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. The Empire Strikes Back is on my Top 10 Best Movies of All Time list. One of the greatest films ever made. One of the greatest sequels ever made. It surpasses A New Hope. The soundtrack is outstanding and beautiful. Han and Leia make a great and beautiful couple and still remain as the greatest and most iconic romantic couple in film history. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have fantastic and perfect chemistry. The action in this movie is so amazing. It is a really fun movie. Episode V still has the greatest lightsaber duel ever. Darth Vader is an even cooler and better villain in this sequel than he was in A New Hope. This sequel is dark and sinister which is so great and fits perfectly with the story. This is proof that a movie doesn't need to be PG-13, R, or NC-17 rated to be dark. It's truly amazing how a PG-rated movie can be so dark and sinister. There are some pretty high stakes in this film which makes it even more emotional and greater than its predecessor. This movie has the greatest plot twist ever and the greatest cliffhanger ending ever. Irvin Kershner still remains as the best Star Wars movie director. He should have directed the Star Wars prequels instead of that cheap, arrogant, stupid, fat bastard George Lucas!

Rating: 10/10"
The third act is very good but the rest is pretty much filler . Still good movie though .
Greatest sequel of all time.
It's my favorite movie of all time and has been pretty much as long as I can remember.
"I consider this as my third favourite Star Wars movie (not including rogue one and solo), behind The Last Jedi and Return of the Jedi. It is one of the unique films that a villain actually won."
"A dark, brooding sequel with plot twists that leaves you wanting more."
best movie in the original trilogy.
"Not only the best Star Wars movie of ALL time, Empire is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema."
This will always be the best Star Wars movie in history. No movie can surpass it (looking at you Star Wars The Last Jedi).
The best Star Wars film
"""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" contains the fun, adventurous, and large-scale atmosphere of the first, but adding a surprisingly well-done dark twist. With stellar writing, great acting, fantastic effects, and an amazing soundtrack, this film proves it is worth a few watches at least."
"Perhaps the best sequel ever produced for any movie series, and I include T2 and Aliens in that assessment. Nothing could have prepared my 11 year old self for the arrival and impact of the movie, and it still gives me goosebumps today."
The best Star Wars film by far
The best Star Wars film ever made. This is the one that open my eyes to the real magic that made this beloved franchise what it is. I first watched it as a kid. Without bias. No one told me I was supposed to watch it. No one forced me. No one sold it to me. I simply turn on the tv and it happened to be on. The rest is history.
The best of all the Star Wars Movies
Best Star Wars Film Ever. Easily In The Top 5 Best Films Ever.
"To say that Empire is only the best Star Wars movie or only the best movie sequel would not give it the credit it deserves. It is, arguably, one of the best films created in history, and for good reasons. The brilliant screenplay by Lucas and Kasdan tells a story that improves off of its predecessor, and grows to be an original and well crafted story of its own. The acting from the Star Wars cast in this movie is at its peak in the franchise, fully immersing you into their meticulously designed world. Kershner is possibly a better director than Lucas. The way he shot each scene was done with precision and fluidity, giving the film a beautiful and magical feel. It is hard to think of a more shocking twist than Darth Vader revealing to Luke that he is his father. This not only shocks its viewers, but it humanizes Vader in a way we had not seen before. We are almost sympathetic to Vader when we see him reach out to his son through the force, asking Luke to join him, giving us a complex perspective on the film. While Vader in A New Hope was certainly a striking villain, he was a powerful and mysterious villain in Empire. The films use of practical effects was revolutionary, similar to the original ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2Star Wars. In the end, this is an incredible film that does not receive the recognition that it deserves."
"One of the best of all time. Flawless, just as A New Hope."
"Truly one of the best of the three. Here Luke goes from young buckling to a man. And one of the best things about this movie is the growth of the protagonist. From failure comes growth. I'm not really sure where George got the idea about the fighting scenes in Cloud City, but it's just absolutely fascinating. The acting by Carrie and Ford was so organic, you could almost believe that they were in fact in love."
"Ho poco da dire, uno dei migliori blockbuster della storia del cinema. Capolavoro."
"This will forever be looked at as the perfect way to make a sequel, it took everything good from the first film and built on it flawlessly."
"One of the best movies of all time, plain and simple."
Brilliant meaningful sequel
"this is how you do a great second movie.  the characters had growth, luke finds out he is not the bad ass he thinks he might be.  Vader is shown to be the ultimate bad guy, not being beating by a untrained force user like Kylo Ren getting his ass beat by Rey.   and they were smart, not stupid enough to kill luke skywalker and ruin the franchise like disney allowed lucasfilm to do."
I miss star wars of old
It’s amazing how this movie holds up over time. This is the best in the franchise
Perhaps the greatest movie sequel of all time!  Many feel this one tops the original.
Best ever Star Wars film
Best star wars one of greatest movies ever made
"The Empire Strikes back is better than A New Hope on every level. The characters are even more fleshed out, it has better pacing, more interesting mythology, and boasts better effects.

9/10"
"Greatest sequel and possible, no.. surely, movie of all time"
"The best addition to the Star Wars saga. All the fun of the original, with new challenges handed to and already fascinating set of characters."
My all time favorite movie sequel.
"The pinnacle of expounding on great storytelling in the continuation of the mythological-film that changed everything. Villains reach epic heights in their attempt to catch the Rebels, and heroes see bottomless lows as the Empire haunts their steps. The next chapter examines protagonists as they change from adolescents in this coming of age story. Every-man Luke Skywalker takes an unexpected turn on his Rebellion-led path and emerges haunted by the murky truth and lies crafted around him. Leia is faced with peril and revelations she cannot acknowledge except in the height of stress. Han's smug bravery and brashness are put to the test as our favorite scoundrel comes to terms with his past and destiny. The Star Wars saga lives on in this film, reaching herald heights none of us could ever quite anticipate or imagine. The stories from a galaxy far, far away will teach generations henceforth the craft of modern mythology, ethos, and pathos. Many movies will strive to achieve this capstone, but none will dethrone this majestic champion."
Spoiler alert!!! Vader is Luke’s dad.
"Brilliant, close second to return of the Jedi, saber fight was awful imo."
"A rare movie sequel that improves over the original, this movie is full of great twists and stunning looking planets and locations."
Critically the best Star Wars film to date and my personal favourite of the original three Star Wars films. John Williams's music has always been a highlight in the Star Wars films and Empire is his strongest Star Wars soundtrack to date. Simply put this is perfect storytelling.
"There is nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said millions of times, so just watch it already!"
"The other ""Best movie of all time"""
"Great story telling. Great effects, and a twist that still surprises younger audiences who are being introduced to the films."
"Full of amazing battle sequences, Star Wars Episode V is an impressive entry into the Star Wars saga."
Greatest movie of all time!!!
BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!
"Actors are more confident and more believable from ""Star Wars"" and is one of the best sequels of all time. The pacing and the darker tone add so much to Luke Skywalkers arc as a character."
Definetly the best Star Wars movie
"Undoubtedly my favorite of the star wars films, even if it is not the best in terms of technical skill. minus half a star because it cannot stand on it's own as film without seeing New Hope first."
What more can be said about this amazing movie?
Best Star Wars film ever.  Enough said
"This is the most, must watch movie in the series. Easily a top 50 film of all time."
Best Star Wars movie ever!!!  This is a must see i get goosebumps thinking about when I saw this as a child in theaters.
A perfect sci-fi movie with a cultural-defining twist.
"cool effects and just an awesome all around exciting fun movie with tones of action and space battles, thank you for making Star Wars all your real fans loved it please make more"
Best Star Wars movie ever
The best Star Wars film ever made and perhaps the best action film ever made. Without Empire there is no Star Wars.
"The best Star Wars, the best space opera movie of all time."
still the best star wars film and one of the best movies of all time
BEST! STAR WARS! EVER!!!!!!!
"With more development involving everything the first film gave us, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few sequels that surpasses the original."
"Another fantastic entry in the Star Wars series, probably the one that solidified it as something that was here to stay."
"Excellent story, excellent character development, excellent twice & excellent cliffhanger. this film is utterly amazing. this is star wars at its finest!!!"
another masterpiece after - a new hope -
This Movie Is A Masterpiece! (5/5)
"My favorite movie of all time. Amazing the most worthy sequel of an already amazing movie. Super well made with a beautiful score, a much more darker movie but not without he heart and love of a Star Wars movie."
Watched again as an adult. Emotionally charged
Very good moovie original my second favorite of Star Wars saga
"One of the best films of all time! Not only the best in the franchise but my favorite film of all time! The empire strikes back was dark, fun, and it had one of the greatest twists ever. I love this film and It's definitely a classic."
This is the perfect movie. Enough said.
The best Star Wars film ever...
"There isn't a single boring part in this movie. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect blend of suspense, sympathy for the characters, Vader, and romance. The best Star Wars movie in my opinion, and it doesn't even have a Death Star!"
One of the best movies of all time.
STILL THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER!!!
"Con uno de los mejores giros de argumento de la historia, Jorge hizo una excepción de secuela épica, con romance impresionante, personajes icónicos, frases icónicas, sin duda la mejor pelicula de star wars y se empata con TOY STORY 2"
Best movie in the whole saga. Millions times better than The Last jedi which was a poor copy
"With all the great elements of the first film, now with darker themes, amazing twists, and Yoda"
The 2nd best Star Wars movie.
"It contains everything the new hope has except in a slightly darker way: Its greatest strength and biggest weakness.
-7.5/10"
"Epic moments, but misses in a lot of places"
"The empire strikes back is one of those rare sequels that is better than it’s predecessor. This movie took everything that you loved about a new hope and made it into something a whole lot better. This movie has the best characters, the best twists and I think that the empire strikes back is one of the best films ever made!"
"Best movie of old Star Wars trylogy. Best plot, Most unexpected plot twist in history. Timeless special efects. Most iconic Sci-Fi movies of all time."
"A movie that does everything a great sequel should do, raise the stakes, develop characters, and introduce new concepts while still being faithful to the first film."
A brilliant sequel to a new hope
Great movie and the best of the OT star wars
Breathtaking And Visually Stunning. The Best In The Series And Franchise.
Luke. I am your father. BEST Star Wars episode ever.
Will always be a special movie for me. One of the best movies ever
A masterpieces of time
"No,I am your father!"
"""No Luke, I am your father."" -Darth Vader
Definitely my all-time favorite movie"
best of the franchise
Best Star Wars ever!
"4.5/5.  Empire isn't quiet as good as the original, but it's iconic for a reason with plenty of fantastic character moments, solid action, and one of the best lightsaber duels in the series."
"Brilliant. A true example and template for how to make a sequel, completely original, daring, interesting and inventive."
"The Best Star Wars Movie Ever! With Irvin Kershner as director, he took the script that George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan wrote and delivered character development and visually dazzling entertainment! John Williams delivered another score that extends his legacy as the greatest film composer who has ever lived! The cast is on cue throughout the entire story!"
"Do not despair for this movie exists here on this planet to champion all that is fair, And nothing less. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"As the saying goes, the sequel is never as good as the original, but there are definitely major exceptions to this. One of them is The Empire Strikes Back, which, in contrast to the happy go lucky nature of A New Hope, puts our protagonists in dire situations from the start. The title is fitting, as we see the bad guys retaliate from their stunning defeat at the first Death Star. Han, Leia and Chewbacca are on the run from the Empire, while Luke tries to follow his own path of becoming a Jedi master. Things go awry, and those lead to some of the best moments of the series. From Han's desperate attempts to avoid the grasp of Vader, his complicated relationship with Leia, to Luke's struggle to find himself not just as a Jedi but as a person, we find the emotional stakes much bigger this time around. Not to mention the special effects, which are absolutely phenomenal. Everyone remembers The Battle of Hoth and the monstrous AT-AT's, but there's plenty of eye candy, like the asteroid belt and the breathtaking world of Bespin and Cloud City. Luke's training in the perpetually dark, swampy Dagaboh where he learns from Yoda is also iconic. 

Whenever someone scoffs at Star Wars, thinking of it just for nerds or sci-fi aficionados, tell them to watch A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, and they'll be converts in no time."
"very good, but my least favorite of the original trilogy."
The perfect sequel.  The movie by which all others are judged.
"Considered the best Star Wars film so far and quite possibly one of the best films ever made, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the second film in the beloved classic saga, released in 1980 and somehow manages to improve on everything about the first film, which itself was pretty much perfect. Picking up just a couple of years after the events of ""A New Hope"" and the Rebellion's win over the Empire, the Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, is trying to locate the new base of the Rebels. In the meantime, Luke Skywalker is in search of the Jedi Master Yoda, which will help him train to become a Jedi Knight. When the Rebels are captured though, Luke must decide whether he will fight Darth Vader to save his friends or continue his training with his mentor. Once again, the cast shines, with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher delivering yet again some truly dedicated performances, joined by Billy Dee Williams as the charmer Lando Calrissian. The film doubles down on the action and the darker moments. There is a whole lot more of the terrifying Sith Lord Darth Vader. The story takes some unpredictable and shocking turns that change the franchise forever, adding up to what may be the most captivating chapter in the entire Skywalker saga. There is not even the need to talk about the breathtaking score of John Williams, which adds up to the epicenes of the storytelling. Simply put, this film is a masterpiece."
Loved this episode really enjoyed
"This movie is what made star wars truly great, it still lives up in effects story and drama, a true classic."
"How could you improve on a film that was already great? Well Empires Strikes Back knows how to. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is a widely-revered entry in the Star Wars series and rightfully so. It contains a great plot, characters are more developed, action is intense and well-done, and the twist is one of the best in cinema history (not gonna spoil, in case there are people who haven't seen it yet). If you haven't seen it, what's wrong with you, go watch it ASAP!"
The most emotional film in the Star Wars Saga.
Very solid film with possibly the greatest plot twist (that everybody already knows) in cinema history!
I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
I still remember my reaction to that 'one' scene in this film. I cannot believe this is still one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time. truly fantastic to see such an old film still be so big in this day in age.
The best one in my and many others opinion
One of the best sequels ever made.
The greatest movie ever made.  If Empire Strikes Back were a woman I'd marry her.
No Luke i am your father.
"This is arguably the best Star Wars movie ever made. It's darker and more sophisticated than the original, and basically every character has serious growth and moments to shine!  This movie basically has everything, from epic battles to romance to powerful reveals, and everything in between. It's not my favourite of the original trilogy, that honour goes to Return of the Jedi, but only by a hair.

These movies had a profound effect on me when growing up. They are timeless, completely enthralling for people of all ages."
"Its a classic dark fantasy but Rogue One is even darker in my opinion. Yes, uncertainty is in Empire Strikes Back,but the Death Star remains after Rogue One which makes Empire the second darkest movie!! Still a classic and very good twists , Yoda, Hoth,and of course Darth Vader make this a thrilling adventure!!!"
"One of the best sequels you could see, it adds to the story without making it harder for new viewers to enjoy. Truly something for you to enjoy time and time again with friends and family."
One of the best Star Wars movies
One of the Best Movie Sequel of all-time and One of my favourite movies of the century
Best Star Wars movie in the galaxy
"Maybe the best movie of all the Star Wars films... but because it depends on that woeful Return of the Jedi for its ending, its perfection is marred."
Best Star Wars movie ever
"This could not have been better in any way. After watching it hundreds of times, there are few ways to surpass the original, but along with Aliens, and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, this was one of them. It was geniuses put together, showed more character improvement and expansion. We got to know the villains better, and we got to meet new and exciting characters."
arguebly the best film of all time
"the battle of hoth, the quotes, the characters are what make this movie memorable."
This isn't my favorite our of all the originals but it sure is a good adventure.
One of the best sequels ever made. It has aged well.
"One of the best Star Wars/ sequel films of all time. Great action sequence, nice visual effects, great characters, beautiful soundtrack and a well written story."
So  Good.  Still fun/entertaining to watch after almost 40 years.  this is the one that validated the SW franchise.
Amazing film is a bit slow but still great.
Is there really anything to be said at this point?
"The 2nd best star wars movie. The action sequences were fantastic, it had an amazing duel at the end and the characters develop amazingly from the first movie."
Masterpiece. Would rate this a 6 star if i could.
Best star wars movie ever made.
"Like the first one, a masterpiece. Also has one of the biggest plot twists of all time. 5*"
Best star wars movie ever made... this is the bench mark for all star wars films.
Darth Vader is back who will win this battle Luke will fight Vader that was a cool battle and a scary fight. But is Luke ready to hear the truth about something! I’m not going to say. But the force is getting stronger with Luck.
Part 5 is of sequel empire.
The best of them all!
My favorite movie of all time!
Star wars in all its glory!
"Quite possibly the best and most important sequel ever made of any movie. The Heroes of Yavin are humbled and made human and the greater Star Wars universe is greatly expanded upon. The Darth Vader v Luke Skywalker lightsaber battle and the major revelation that Vader is Anakin are classic. the introduction of Yoda, Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian are very important to the movie plot and the saga as a whole. plus this film proved that sequels could be both profitable and critically acclaimed at a time when hollywood used sequels to milk the viewing public."
its a good movie and very very epic and star wars is my daddy
One of the best films to ever hit theaters whether you're a SW fan or not. It never gets old. A classic
Still the best Star Wars has to offer.
"A superb film that is highly unlikely to ever be outdone as the best Star Wars film ever or possible the best Sci fi film of all time. Watching this film for the first time was such a buzz, I truely thought that the world could be anything I wanted. Watching subsequent times it's still inspiring, I simply love the film."
Han Solo should not be invited to any more dinner parties.
This is still my favorite Star Wars movie
Greatest Star Wars movie ever!!!!
Liked it back in the day. Thought the story was slow in the middle. But after It grew on me.   A perfect  follow through from a New Hope.
"Outstanding movie. It suffers only from the poor resolution, making it in effect an incomplete story. Compare it to the previous entry and you'll find it lacking in that regard. It's a shame, as the attack on the Hoth base is my favorite of any Star Wars movie."
Great movie! Does not disappoint.
This film is a true classic and absolutely captures the essence of a magnificently written and acted film. The twists pay off memorable moments and the characters are written amazingly. We get to delve deeper into the wonderfully crafted world of Star Wars by exploring different and fresh planets and meet exciting new characters along the way. Truly the best of the Star Wars franchise that just might not ever see the day of being topped by another Star Wars Film again.
"The Empire Strikes Back Is Legendary, the story, tone and the pace, lightsaber duel and the big reveal! 11/10"
The best of the Original Trilogy and my personal favourite.
The best of the series!!!
Best Star Wars movie.
"Best Star Wars movie ever! 
what a master piece! Thank you George Lucas!"
"Arguably the best if it was not for the first movie, this is equally great."
Best of the Star Wars Saga!
"The best Star Wars film by far, the story and acting comes together to tell a brilliant story. That is both dark and full of hope for the future."
I am one of the crazy ones that likes ANH (Just Star Wars!) better. But I love this movie.
"Dated, the Rebellion is just as bad as the Empire, the Rebellion could have been ended yet they wastes time pursuing one person
..smdh"
"A near perfect film to continue the trilogy. Absolutely brilliant, sad things is that the SJW critics are saying that The Last Jedi is better than ESB, Bullshit."
I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!! >:( BECAUSE EMPIRE WINNING!!!!
"This is by far the best movie of the Star Wars saga. Awesome action scenes well paced, great characters and dialogue,"
"A darker take on the heroes of ""A New Hope"", fraught with turmoil that challenges our heroes in a new way - in short: the epitome of a great sequel and an even greater film!"
"The best of the franchise.The twists and turns,the atmosphere,the way it grabs its viewer. is unparalleled.Truly the best sequel of all time."
"A virtually flawless film and one of the most important films in history, in my opinion. Enough has already been said, but if you haven't seen it, then your life may not be whole."
"With a darker tone and deeper narrative, The Empire Strikes Back shows audiences how great sequels can truly be"
"Above all else, I feel this movie is mostly about Luke Skywalker's development as a character. Arguably, the entire trilogy is. As always, Darth Vader is an awesome and threatening antagonist. The third act of this movie is easily the best, with the Cloud City setting and duel between Luke and Vader. My favorite scene in the film is when Luke is dueling Vader in the dark after Han is frozen in carbonite. I feel they nailed that scene because Vader's voice is 10x more threatening in a dark and claustrophobic enviornment. The only real criticism I have is that the movie can get boring at times, and some scenes lack interest. At the end of the day, The Empire Strikes Back is a good movie, but, in my opinion, is not the best."
Best Star Wars movie ever made.
"As the crown jewel of the Star Wars saga, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" not only explores the darker side of the Star Wars universe but it also introduces a more complex Luke, verifiably badass Han, and terrifyingly formidable Vader. The multi-dimensionality that is evidently lacking within the characters throughout the original becomes abundant with the introduction of a non-binary morality. Simply put, ""Empire"" is driven by the interplaying motivations among characters rather than just the standard protagonist-antagonist model that the others exhibit. This is precisely the complexity that gives the film its elegance."
I didn't like it when Luke lost his hand.
"While I may never understand why ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is many peoples favorite ""Star Wars"" film, this film still succeeds on many levels."
favorite episode of the series
"Not Only The Best Film In The Star Wars Saga, But The Best Film Ever Put On Screen"
This movie is the opposite of Rose Tico.
possibly the greatest movie sequel ever
"Hands down, one of the best movies ever created for entertainment. Great acting, a fantastic story line, and huge life changing plot twists. The Empire strikes back is hands down the best star wars movie ever made."
"One of my favorites movies of all time, a true masterpiece."
Perhaps the first time in Hollywood history a sequel is better then the original. This movie turns the dial up to 12. The director Kershner got a hell of a performance out of all the actors especially Harrison Ford.
"Has all the elements of a great classic, beautiful score and breathtaking storyline..."
The second greatest fantasy film of all time.
My Favorite Star Wars movie.
"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980), is the definition of space epic. The movie makes you take it seriously, and is the reason why Star Wars has become solidified in society. There is nothing noticeable wrong with this movie. Not only the greatest Star Wars movie of all time, but one of the best of all time ever. Rating: 5/5 96%"
"One of, if not the, greatest movies of all time. i can't describe the feeling this movie gives you. watch it."
"One of the greatest movies in history. The battle of Hoth will always be one of the greatest in Star Wars, the introduction of cloud city was perfection. Watched this 20+ times, and still plan to again!"
This movie shows the real power of Darth Vader and it shows that Empire isn't just gonna lose all the time. Meaning the bad guys can win too! It makes Star Wars way more realistic.
"The first is a classic, but Empire really is the best Star Wars movie out there."
"Improves upon the first with added depth to the characters, a darker and more intense story and in my opinion it was the film that made the franchise what it is today."
"Empire is not just the best star wars movie, but in truth one of the best films ever made. the dialogue and performances truly bring all characters to life, giving them depth and showing several facets of their personalities, from romantic banter to enduring lines to live by. the pace is fantastic. The movie manages to balance luke's training with the dire situation of the falcon's passengers masterfully. The world of Star Wars feels large for the first time, with much greater stakes and characters the feel human, with flaws and strengths, and presenting themes that remain as current today as they did back in 1980. This is one that will remain great no matter how many years pass."
"Simply the best. A film that's perfectly paced with some of the most interesting character interplay in a rich and diverse galaxy gripped by conflict. The Empire Strikes Back defines Star Wars and is not only the franchise's best film, but one of the best films of all time."
The best star wars movie ever
Great twist and a great all around movie
This will forever be one of the greatest movies ever made. A complete masterpiece.
"The absolute best of them all, thanks to Mr. Irvin Kershner's excellent directorial vision."
Everything in this movie is iconic!
"My favorite Star Wars of all time, they don't make movies like this anymore."
"Trigger warning. I don't think Empire is better than A New Hope, heck, i don't even like it as much as Revenge of the Sith. Yes, the scenes with Yoda and Luke training on Dagobah are pure gold, the duel with Vader was also great and an enormous improvement over what we previously saw. But the battle for Hoth was just alright, and the Cloud City was a boring filler. And that was a majority of the movie, so that's a problem. This is the only movie of the original 6 that had me occasionally bored, but on the upside - It never made me cringe at a bad line either."
One of the best sequels ever made. The characters were well tested and consistent. The double-edged plot was gripping and a well-told story. The practical effects used were explosive and tangible. Great soundtrack. This film is a good example of film collaboration at its best - this was not a one-man creation. Thankfully the least tampered with in the subsequent DVD releases. The only thing to be critical of is the way good and evil are portrayed: what made the Empire evil and the Rebellion good?
Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father. Awesome!
"one of the greatest films ever made. do we need to go into why? beautifully written, iconic, emotional"
"More emotional and darker than its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back continues on the epic stature and effects which drove its predecessor forward, while continuing with fan-favorite characters with both charisma and emotion, and some of the most memorable moments and action ever to come out of the Sci-fi genre."
The sequel that is one of the most important films in movie history
"Unlike most sequels, this film is better than it's predecessor. With a intriguing story and amazing twists, this film will leave the audience on the edge of their seats."
"Like a lot of other people, this is my favorite film in the original trilogy as well as the Star Wars Series as a whole. I know I have nostalgia goggles on when I give it 4/5, but it is a timeless classic."
"i don't like the relation of Han Solo and Leia, the adventures continue, Yoda had an unexpected behavior but most wiser, c3po and r2d2 are particularity annoying in this one, in resume a good movie full of unexpected things"
I liked this even more than the New Hope.  Star Wars rules!
If you have not watched any of the original saga.  There is something wrong with you.  All three legendary movies go down as some of the greats!
Best sequel to a movie ever
"A great movie, worth watching. Well written, with great characters. The music is stunning as always. The only negative is some of the special effects. While the majority hold up really well, there are certain things, such as an obvious puppet yoda and obvious stopmotion that briefly take me out of the movie. Certain shots have also been repeated and mirrored which stands out like a sore thumb to me. But these are only minor gripes and its negative impact on the overall experience with the movie is minimal. Overall this film is up there with the best star wars movies and well worth watching."
"Perhaps the greatest sequel to an already great movie. This movie has many of the most iconic moments in film, and this movie features the move iconic plot twist in movie history."
"Probably my favorite star wars movie (by far) because of how awesome it is (and it created my favorite star wars character ever, boba fett) and its awesome story is great."
"The best movie of my childhood, and a shocking revelation in the end."
My Favorite Star Wars Movie
"There aren't many sequels that can live up to the original film, but The Empire Strikes Back does so almost effortlessly."
"The Empire Strikes Back is just a phenomenally crafted film. Adding very much to the lore we learned from the original, and even shocking you with cinema's biggest twist to date (99.5% of the worlds population knows it now anyway) Empire Strikes back has no flaws...and is...A Masterpiece.
 I'll give it 
         - 100%"
Easily the best one.
The best moment in the saga.
"The best of the best, movie is just plain good."
"I loved the start on Hoth, and one of the best Scifi movies of all time."
"A darker but more involving sequel, this instalment in the 'Star Wars' saga offers an amazing and emotional plot. Arguably the greatest sci-fi fantasy film to ever be created, with an iconic soundtrack. I give it a worthy 100%."
"Simply, just the best"
It carries well and has visual delights and new intriguing characters. Wonderful music. This 'dark' episode as it has been called is overstated as there is a strong sense of good and light right through it.
"The absolute pinnacle of Star Wars media, this film has everything: action, romance, and game-changing plot twists. This is partially possible because it essentially functions as the climax of the trilogy. Luke is a standout, but in my opinion the movie belongs to Han Solo and Leia Organa, who manage to portray a type of romantic tension that's difficult to pull off."
"This is one of my favorite movies really love the At-ATs in the movie Cloud city is beautiful and Lando Calrissian is an awesome character, Han Solo was great and so were the other characters and Yoda was also great Obi-Won being a force ghost but i miss him he is my 2nd favorite star wars character Hoth was a beautiful planet along with Dagoba. Overall it is a awesome movie."

The crown achievement in the whole saga.  Truly legendary.
This is the best of the Star Wars films.  The battle between Luke and Vader is perhaps the greatest scene in the history of film.  The Empire Did Nothing Wrong.
"This is one of the greatest, if not the greatest sequel of all time. I can't believe they actually made a movie sequel that is better than the extremely good original. It is very rare. The CGI is great and once again still holds up today. The performances are all great while also introducing some new characters. The space battles are awesome, with the greatest lightsaber fight in the original trilogy. One of the greatest sequels of all time is worth the two hour runtime"
One of if not THE most shocking movie of my childhood.
One Of The Best Sequels Of All Time!! Also Has One Of The Biggest Plot Twists Of All Time!!
"Simply wonderful. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen this film, but it’s not enough! Nuanced, beautiful, and chock-full of everything that is at the heart of Star Wars, this is one of the films that has influenced my life most."
"Great movie, compelling characters and plots."
"Such a beautiful & magnificent film, both visually and story wise. Definitely the best Star Wars film and also one of the greatest films of all time."
Great film! Highly recommend to anyone!
"The Imperial March alone makes this film one of the greatest ever made. Absolutely spectacular. I definitely agree with many of the people I've heard from because this is the best of the Star Wars franchise. It has incredible score, great characters, some of my favorite moments in cinema, great special effects, good humor, and great action. I say this is a great movie, everyone says, ""I know."" Love it!"
"Even though I prefer Return OF The Jedi, this is by FAR, the second best Star Wars movie ever made !  A Masterwork !"
"my favourite movie of this saga, the sequence is really good..."
A classic from start to finish. The best Star Wars movie ever made! A flawed hero who actually loses a limb and the battle. Barely making it out of the movie alive . No Larry Stu in this movie.
"Great second Star Wars classic after A New Hope, with a well-crafted storyline, along with the original characters and musical score.
May the Force be with you, George Lucas!"
"The acting is superb, the effects are unparalleled, the music is amazing, and the plot is great. Surpassing the original, this is one of my favorite movies of all time."
"One of the greatest films of all time. The ending is one of the best in cinema history, amazing."
Pretty good movie I like the fight of Luke and Darth Vader
"A prodigal Jedi gets lost in a snowstorm and almost eaten, and then almost dies in the cold where he has a vision of a ghost telling him to travel to a warmer location where he meets the galaxy's most idiosyncratic muppet in a swamp who trains him in the ways of the Force.  Meanwhile his friends (and later to be revealed, his family) ""float away with the rest of the garbage"" to Cloud City where they meet a suave scoundrel, and are tortured for no reason they can discern.  The young Jedi then attempts a rescue, but is instead confronted by the galaxy's most ruthless dark knight who cuts off the young Jedi's hand, reveals a shocking family secret, then is audacious enough to suggest they rule the galaxy together.  Then they all escape.  I mean almost all of them.  One guy doesn't."
"One of the best movies of all time and it brings the franchise to a new high. It gives the franchise some amazing twist and turns with Luke being the son of Darth Vader. It brings the franchise to a darker but more emotional level. Empire Strikes Back is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting from Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, and Billy Dee Williams was stupendous. The voice over performance from Frank Oz was great. The visuals, puppets, and animatronics were gorgeous especially Yoda and R2-D2. The writing, storyline and plot were all done spectacularly. The musical score was amazing just like in the first one. This is my 2nd favorite Star Wars movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. A+"
One of the best movies ever made.
Untouchable as the best Star Wars movie. Simply amazing!
Great movies...i use to dream of being a Jedi!
"Somehow it manages to top A New Hope in providing memorable moments. When one thinks of Star Wars, images of Empire largely come to the fore."
"This is far and away the best Star Wars movie and definitely one of the best movies of all time!!!!

Praise is where praise is deserved. And Empire delivers on all aspects. To even compare this to the stinker that is Last Jedi is an insult to humanity. 

The heroes we are rooting for. Han,Leia chewie C3p0 all have excellent character arcs. Luke is growing into his role as a Jedi but has much to learn. Which why his arc is so compelling. Oh and Yoda one of the best characters ever to grace the silver screen.
TLJ characters= zzzzzzzzzz

Darth Vader comes into his own as cinemas greatest villain. His gallows humour ""Apology accepted"" is pure gold. He really is a terrifying antagonist and has a presence alongside the Imperial march theme. 
We've yet to see a villian of such like on a movie screen.
TLJ villians= Kylo is Anakin 2.0 meh

Every scene is crafted in such a way that has atmosphere and a beauty thats mesmerising. The plot is absolute genius and has a subtle build up to the big reveal. Yet still has the impactful shock. When you see it for the first time you are eager to watch Return of the Jedi to see how the story goes. Yet even if you watch it 1000 times this movie never ages or dulls. Its still as entertaining as the first time. 

TLJ has failed in so many areas where Empire succeeds. Does anyone care for episode 9? Nope cos TLJ is a trainwreck.

All i can say is enjoy this movie for what it is. One of the greatest films of All time. A pure masterpiece of art by George Lucas!"
"Redefining how good a sequel could be, The Empire Strikes back took the original trilogy to a new level of emotional depth.  Sporting a new set of enthralling characters such as Lando Calrissian, Yoda, and Boba Fett, along with arguably the greatest plot twist in cinema history, this movie is a very strong contender for the best movie of the saga.  The acting and soundtrack remain just as good, if not better, than A New Hope, and although the visuals are outdated today they were revolutionary for their time.  The genuine chemistry between Han Solo and Princess Leia is beyond anything that the prequels could have hoped to achieve, Luke's troubled path to becoming a Jedi remains far more involving than the sequels' attempt with Rey, and Darth Vader solidifies his stance as the most sinister movie villain of all time.  The new locations like Hoth, Bespin, and Dagobah are all beautifully thought out, and the already-great story is propped up by dark themes and intense action.  Not only is The Empire Strikes Back my personal favorite of the saga but one of the greatest films ever made."
"What is to say about this movie other than it is a masterpiece that can never be topped. This movie even tops the original Star Wars, which is a feat obtained by only a handful. From beginning to end, the audience is presented with a story that is action packed, entertaining as fuck, much deeper than the previous movie, and is overall brilliant. Not to mention, John Williams score for this movie is even better than in ""A New Hope."" Astounding. Every bit of this movie is classic and memorable. The force is explored in greater depths with an old master that is wise and ends up making Luke look like a fool sometimes, Han and Leia's adventure is breathtakingly entertaining and their love is light years better than Anakin and Padme's in Attack of the Clones. Not to mention Lando Calrissian, the smooth talking traitor that eventually joins the Rebellion. Overall, if I was to list every single positive about this movie, I would be listing every single part of this movie. Not only is this probably the best Star Wars movie, but it is considered by many to be the best movie of all time."
Still the best Star Wars to date.
Even better than the original in my opinion
"Its good, its great, its fantastic. Enough of this film has been said already. If you haven't seen this film yet then where have you been living, under bantha fodder?"
Brilliant movie with the perfect story arch. Aside from a few time inconsistencies this movie embodies perfection in cinema. One of those movies that gets better each time you watch it
The best SW movie to date (2018).
"Beautifully made, the villains actually feel like villains. Also Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson did not make it."
The best Star Wars film in the entire sarga
alien and star wars prove a sequel can be good!  wow this is depending on if you are a purist....the best art ever made
My all time favourite movie. Enough said.
"They don't make 'em like they used to!
Take heed Disney."
Star Wars will never get better than this ...
"Best in the Series, Force Awakens and Last Jedi shouldn't have the name Star Wars attached to them."
"Had to watch Empire again just to take the terrible test of ""Last Jedi"" out of my mouth!
I LOVED it more than ever... BUT it made me hate ""Last Jedi"" even more!
I literally cried TEARS of ANGER as thought about what they'd done to this once amazing movie series! 

Kathleen Kennedy and Ryan Johnson need to be FIRED NOW!"
I remember this film as the snowy one from my childhood. Never kept my attention. Still can't sit through the whole thing.
A masterpiece!!! It's far superior than TFA and TLJ which both kill the essence and mysticism of the Jedi lore and what Star Wars fundamentally represents.
"Best star war movie, 10/10."
"Perfect movie, no complaints."
The perfect movie of Star Wars
"The greatest part of the timeless trilogy, Star Wars.

One of the better twists in movies, and such a great high point movie, any and every fantasy sci fi should compare themselves to, and template themselves properly.

A great character development progression with a very dark tone, yet able to inspire hope in the darkest of times, and yet also showcasing the struggle of inner struggles and fears."
Must see in its original theatrical cut as restored by Harmy in the Despecialized Edition.
One of my all time favourite movies
"Excellent all the way through. The kind of movie that is infinitely re-watchable. Damn I wish that I could make a movie this good. Amazing in every way even years later. Holds up very well, and timeless."
My favorite of all the Star Wars films.
The best movie of Star Wars.
The undisputed heavy weight champion of the Star Wars universe. Ask any true fan and they will tell you that this is the greatest of all the episodes. The story doesn't get much better than this. The new characters and plot twists...just on another level.
"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a brilliant motion picture, and is still the best ""Star Wars"" movie."
The best of the best!
"Starting with the original Star Wars as a template, what was achieved with Empire Strikes Back would certainly have to be considered genuinely ""ground-breaking"".

""Empire"" brings a level of warmth and heart to what had been comparatively simple characterizations, and elevates them to become the timeless trio of Han, Luke and Leia.

""Empire"" turned a few simple throw-away lines about some mysterious magic trick called the ""Force"", and infuses a level of spiritualism into the idea that it transcends Sci-Fi fictional jibberish to become part of Western culture.

An adventure film from a by-gone era, about romanticism, fallen heroes, honor, and redemption."
I give this a 100/A+.
Classic. Simply the Best.
Fantastic movie. One of my favourites.
5>4>6>>7>R1>3>1>2>>>8 'nuff said.
The best Star Wars film and one of the best films ever made!
"Dark, powerful, well defined characters that shaped my generation of movie-goers.  One of the best movies ever made, period."
One Of The Best Movies Ever Made
"What a big steaming pile of rubbish which totally undermines and undoes the previous movie. We have the Emperor, a bad guy who has no backstory or explanation about who he is or where he comes from. The whole plot just revolves around a giant chase, with the rebels trying to outrun an endless pursuit from the bad guys. A former great Jedi master and warrior is suddenly now a crazy old hermit living in exile, totally against his character. The crazy hermit manages to train his pupil in the force in just a few hours while the tedious space chase is going on elsewhere. Luke's actions are completely out of character and he makes stupid decisions. Plot-holes everywhere and physics seems to go out of the window, i.e. Leia somehow manages to survive the vacuum of space and characters manage to survive fatal injuries without a scratch and ships can somehow drop bombs in zero gravity. The good guys get completely hammered by the bad guys which completely destroys the victories and successes that have gone before. Star Wars is ruined for ever.

** I truly hope people see the point of this which is to highlight how ridiculous the idiots bashing The Last Jedi are. **"
Awesomeness incarnate. Best Star wars to date imo.
"I feel like this movie gets TOO much credit. Yes, it was excellent, but no it was not better than A New Hope. Definitely dark and has a ton of unexpected reveals. A classic for sure, but perhaps a little overhyped to meet the high reviews of people."
"The Star Wars movie against which all others should be measured, IMNSHO. All the spirit and freshness of A New Hope, but with more settled-in-their-role actors and the funding to get the special effects up to snuff. Great reveals. Great, properly-explained introduction of new characters."
The best movie of the series
In my opinion one of the best movies ever made!
Best Star Wars movie ever and might just be my favorite movie ever.
"It's one thing to have a good movie, but to have a sequel just as good, if not better, is what I really like to see."
"Often seen by people I know to be the best film in the series, it continues to make lovable characters and a wonderful plot that will be a classic forever."
"My favorite of the movies, slightly ahead of Star Wars and Revenge of the Sith."
"""Could anything be better than A NEW HOPE?"" 
ANSWER: YES!!!!!
Inspiring, surprising, and possibly the greatest twist of all time! Best in the trilogy!"
"Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back is as of right now one of the greatest Star Wars sequel of all times! The plot is fantastic, the visuals are incredible & the characters are better then ever! Amazing!"
This follow up and the original are so strong - people are still “chasing the dragon” hoping to recapture the thrill they experienced watching these wonderful and amazing movies. But 4 of the last 6 Star Wars films have been god awful. Disney has now turned into your local heroine dealer.
My first Star Wars film. The best Star Wars film. Just amazing what happens when George Lucas gets out of the directors chair and just uses his creativity in concert with another great director.
I sequel that better than the original? There is a God
"It's very rare that a sequel manages to match or even best its predecessor. Empire Strikes Back managed to break that trend.

Empire Strikes Back is, in every way, more compelling, emotionally involved, and dramatic than A New Hope. We get to see each character develop and face new struggles. I would argue that there is no standout actor in this movie. Each one is equal in their ability and serves their character well. Though, of course, James Earl Jones' Darth Vader must be mentioned. If there was another voice coming through the mask, he wouldn't be nearly as memorable.

Though I'm normally not a fan of slow starts, this one works in the film's favor. After several important character moments, we get to see an epic ground battle followed by an intense space chase through asteroids. Luke goes on a different path from Han and Leia in this film as he trains with the wise and interesting Master Yoda. Han and Leia have their own struggles as they deal with the foreboding Empire, which is at its best in this part of the trilogy. The movie really starts to shine as the climax draws nearer. Luke and Vader's confrontation, Han and Leia's romance, and Cloud City itself are simply amazing. 

The Empire Strikes Back's mastery is by no means exaggerated (even if it does mean the other films in the series don't get their deserved praise) and easily one of the best and most gripping installments of Star Wars."
"A great sequel that pushes the boundaries of star wars and continues to develop interesting characters. If you haven't seen it I compel you to watch this original trilogy. However do not watch the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi) if you don't want to sour the taste of star wars."
Best film series ever
"I started this account to spew bile at Rian Johnson for the abomination that is the last Jedi- then I thought I would try to cheer myself up by reviewing this and other Star Wars films. Okay so pretty much everyone agrees that this one is the best, and I'm no different, there is real menace in the empire and Vader is mesmerising as the villain who's only real goal is to reach out to his son. Somehow Darth Vader seems to convey profound emotion with a bucket on his head. This movie is great, and Luke Skywalkers story continues to combine high adventure with real heart and soul and of course one of the greatest twists in cinema history. Luke goes through a lot and is well on his way to becoming a Jedi Knight. But don't bother watching it, because in the end he SPOLER ALERT ends up milking a space cow and cuts himself off from the force, so that he can abandon everything he once stood for and sit around breathing his own farts until he finally dies by giving himself a hair cut and colour with the force."
Absolute masterpiece.   I can't believe this movie came out before I was born.  There will never be anything else close to this especially in the Star Wars line.  Anyone that compares the Last Jedi to this needs to rewatch the original movies.  The absolute garbage like the Last Jedi they are creating now is depressing to see.
"What could be better than Star Wars in 1977, the movie that proved that sequels can be better than the original, that can't be said of most sequels but it can be said of this one.  If I were to rate the first three star wars movies, I would rate them as follows: 1. Empire, 2. New Hope, 3. Jedi.  That is what is amazing about this movie, with an amazing clifhanger, introduction of new characters, it advances the story line with romance, humor, great new vehicles (ATAT), and new characters like Lando brought on after complaints about diversity, Boba Fett, and of course the Luke and Yoda training scenes  A great follow up to the original Star Wars, empire delivers as the best of the star wars saga movies."
"A stunning spectacle continuing the franchise, 'The Empire Strikes Back' not only defines itself as one of the best sequels ever made, but even as one of the best science-fiction films ever made, period."
"An absolute masterpiece, I will always remember watching my old VHS tapes of this legendary film in the mid 90s."
not as good as the other 2 but was still a great movie
Great follow up to A New Hope. Lots of great scenes and lines. Humour is spot on once again. Boba Fett is a cool addition. Great sequence at the end between Luke and Darth Vader. And of course there's the mother of all plot twists!
"One of the greatest movies of all time and probably my favorite Star Wars film. I LOVE this movie. My dad took me to see this in the theater when I was 7, and he said he had to check if I was breathing since I didn’t move for 2 hours. I watch this today and it stands, I still don’t move. ;) So emotional, biggest plot twist, probably most quoted movie of all time. If you haven’t, definitely watch this."
The sequel that changed everything. Never gets stale or boring.
"The greatest Sci-Fi film ever made in my opinion. Incredible twists and amazing characterisation left me extremely happy. A cliff hanger ending that leaves you wanting more, this is easily the best Star Wars film ever made! 

Final Score 10/10"
One of my favorite movies in the saga
The absolute best movie in the Star Wars saga by far.
Best in the franchise
best star wars film of all time
"Great second movie in the series (original trilogy).  The Empire is on the movie, and really looking to crush the Rebellion!  How will the Rebels respond?  This movie really makes you feel like you are riding along with it.  Very well done."
The simple elegance of Kersh's filmmaking brings an exciting realism to the world created by George Lucas. This is THE star wars film; a most important hinge connecting the most important trilogy
Absolutely Phenomenal.
My all-time favorite movie.
Best film in the series
"Me to this movie: ""I love you""
ESB to me: ""I know""

C'mon, why are you even reading this? Go watch it! This is the best of the OT! ESB has the best planet battle (Battle of Hoth), the best new character (Lando Calrissian), and a totally amazing and not cheesy romance. The Dagobah training sequences are long and boring, but the rest of the movie is so good, it just doesn't matter.
If you can't recite this movie from start to finish by quoting every single line verbatim, then your life must be as sad and stinky as the inside of a Tauntaun. Fix it now and marathon this movie, ASAP."
It’s the best Star Wars movie
"The best Star Wars film.
A darker tone with some big shocks!
Great characters, like all of them!"
Just the best! No wonder they have lasted generations! Here we learn about Luke’s father on a iconic scene! Vader is more terrifying and awesome! Love Han and Leia chemistry! So heartfelt! This is a master piece! Thank you George for your genius!
"The best entry in the entire franchise, and probably the best scifi film ever made, it has the smoothness of the 4th but with that famous plot twist, better action, even better character interactions, and the acting almost never falters like it did in a few moments in the 4th.  Not really any negatives"
Arguably the best Star Wars movie and arguably the best sequel ever made...The legend of Star Wars is built on the first 2 movies
"This is how a sequel should be. Great plot, character development, and superb action scenes."
"Arguably the best Star Wars film and the best sequel ever made.
Expanding on an excellent contained storyline and blowing the propositions of the galaxy far and wide...a film that will never be bettered, just enjoy?"
"ESB is overrated. Script and visuals weren't bad, but it's actually quite dull. Imperial walker scenes were watchable. But the follow-up scenes were mostly inside a space slug and trudging around a swamp with a deranged troll, bitter about life. DV terrorizes his officers for  90% of the movie, and the crew play around the little falcon set. This wasn't  a great sequel. What is it with Star Wars movies and filth. Trash compactors, swamps, slugs; it all has an ick to it.

Cloud city wasn't bad, but wasn't all that entertaining either. The set just looked so cheap. They run around like idiots to get aboard the same ship for the 5th time. A novice with a light saber takes on a geezer who wears a mask on a respirator. It's dull, depressing, and tired. They should've cut the carbonite scene. With Han Solo gone, it left the movie with an anal brat and cheap film extras. If you need C3PO to carry the cast, you know it's a bad movie. Honestly ESB barely passes as a B-rate film. Meh."
The best Star Wars movie an absolute masterpiece
"It's an almost perfect movie. However, it deserves a 5/5 for that twist."
A masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Empire Strikes Back is one of the best movies ever made
"Puntaje Original: 8.0

Impacatante, impresionante, espectacular, mejor que la anterior, esta película vuelve fanático a cualquiera de Star Wars."
"Redefines what a good sequel can be. The only ""special edition"" that wasn't markedly worse than the theatrical edition, to boot. An absolute must see."
This is not just my favorite Star Wars movie. It's my favorite movie.
One of the finest movies ever crafted. It is a beacon of hope for what Disney just destroyed with TLJ.
"Terrific drama and character progression matched with great action sequences and the best saber duel in the franchise. The Empire Strikes back proves to be the best of the franchise due to its powerful themes and messages from Yoda, as well as its narrative structure that proves to be an effective film."
Love this movie so much. Miss George lucas.
"The best Star Wars movie, and overall one of the best movies ever made."
"As much as I love A New Hope, it can't be said enough how great and important The Empire Strikes Back is. I say important because it changed and ultimately defined how we view the Star Wars saga. Before Episode V, Star Wars was ""just"" a really well crafted, fun space adventure, and there's nothing wrong with that. It would have been so easy to merely recreate that for the sequel (not that this isn't a fun movie). However, George Lucas and Irvin Kershner gambled and crafted something different. The Rebellion's winning streak runs out here, as they royally lose this round against the Empire. We spend a lot of time with Yoda learning about the Force, deepening our knowledge of it rather than coasting on what little we learned about it back in Episode IV. One of our main heroes' future is left in question by the end of the film when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite and taken away by Boba Fett. Perhaps most importantly, everything we thought we knew beforehand is turned upside down when it is revealed that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father (sorry if I spoiled a movie that's been out since 1980, but come on). All of these elements could have blown up in Lucasfilm's face, but it paid off incredibly well. As with its predecessor, this is a lovingly crafted film. The story is great and fast-paced, if maybe not quite as quickly-moving as A New Hope. The effects improve here, and still hold up today. The cast, again, is great, and give grounded performances that help us relate to characters that reside in a galaxy far, far away. The newcomers to the series are great, too, and though I normally wouldn't specifically address certain performances so my reviews wouldn't be too long, I would like to address Frank Oz's debut as Yoda. If his puppeteering and voice work hadn't worked here, it would have taken viewers out of the movie and made it a lot less special. However, you believe Yoda is a living, breathing character, and he only adds to the film. At the end of the day, The Empire Strikes Back was a huge risk as a sequel, but it was a risk that overwhelmingly paid off."
"What may be the greatest star wars movie in the franchise so far, with the most quotable movie  line in cinema history (if you don't know what Im talking about, then you are a very sad and lonely person), the Empire Strikes back starts off with a battle to remember, continues with a bone chilling duel between two powerful beings, a plot twist that makes you say, ""WHAT""... and an ending that leaves you with so many questions you couldn't fit them in a 1,000 page book. Watch this movie, it is one of the greatest of all time."
Es mi favorita de la trilogía original.
Not just the best star wars film but one of the greatest films in cinema history
A true classic. Must watch if you want to experience what is commonly referred as the best film of the OT.
the best out of the orignal trilogy
Hard to find anything wrong with the movie.
"What Star Wars did, Empire Strikes Back does better. The chemistry between the whole cast is amazing and the cinematography in the movie looks amazing even for 1980. Overall, Empire Strikes back is the best Star Wars movie to watch."
One of the best sequels in film history
Not as good as A New Hope but lots of rich Star Wars mythology here.
"One of the greatest movies of all time without a doubt. The characters are complex and Iconic, the tone fits it perfectly. The score is once again amazing. The flaws are slim to none. This is the peak of the star wars franchise. And it still holds up today as one of the best movies ever."
One of the greatest films of all time without a doubt.
the best star wars movie EVERR
greatest movie of all time.
Classic Space Fantasy at its best.
The absolute best of the Star Wars movies; what more can I say. This movie defined the folklore of the force and made everything so much bigger and more important. No Star Wars movie has ever matched this perfect stylistic masterpiece.
"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) - 9/10
Acting - 9/10
Sound/Music - 9/10
Film Storyline - 10/10
Trilogy Continuity - 9/10

Overall - 9.4/10

Perfection!  An amazing example of pure storytelling at it's finest with one of the most surprising plot twists of all-time!"
"Just needed to come and show love for one of the greatest movies of all time after seeing that train wreck The Last Jedi. George Lucas may not have been able to execute his vision properly, but I'll take his world over what I'm seeing now any day. I absolutely love Disney and I never thought they would do it, but they are definitely ruining Star Wars for me"
"Story is really good, but i don´t like that cold environment - snow planet, swamp, Cloud City."
Best movie of the saga by far...an instant classic. This is what Star Wars is about.
5.0/5.0 Perfect and a Amazing life changing film.
"My favourite film out of the star wars franchise. Superb film making, with the best classic twist of all time."
Most Amazing.... Like all the other star wars movies
"This film is nearly a dud.

It shines in character development, acting, and plot twists, but falls flat as an engaging movie.  For that reason, this movie is nearly at the bottom of the saga.  All I want to do past the first 15 minutes in this one is get to the next film in the series."
"Really good, not as good as A New Hope, but I'll take it"
"Sequels usually don't out-perform their predecessors, but The Empire Strikes Back changes the game completely. The Empire deals a heavy blow to the Rebels in the awe-inspiring, spectacular Battle of Hoth. The movie is darker and more sinister than A New Hope. It blows all expectations away and Darth Vader proves to be one of the best antagonists of all time. The lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader is awesome and the shocking twist where Darth Vader reveals he is indeed the father of Luke is phenomenal. The love story between Han and Leia feels very organic and a natural connection between them is defined when Han is being lowered into the carbonite chamber. The movie ends with the heroes feeling defeated after crippling blows by the Empire, leaving the viewers wondering if the Rebels will strike back against the Empire."
"Enough suspense to keep me interested in additional films in the saga. Improved CGI and slightly better acting, as well."
truth killed franchise
"'Empire' is the perfect expansion of the 'Star Wars' universe, and soars even higher than its revolutionary predecessor. It takes each of the already beloved characters in intriguing new directions, and introduces some iconic new ones. A certain little green Jedi Master is a scene-stealer, and emulates just as much emotion as the human actors do. The visuals and action sequences are astonishingly timeless and still hold up to this day. From the opening battle on the ice planet 'Hoth,' to the climactic duel in the breathtaking 'Cloud City,' the film never ceases to dazzle. Also a high note of the film is the cliffhanger ending, that reveals what is perhaps the most shocking plot-twist of all time; a complete game-changer for the saga. The film's courage to bring more complexity to what was originally thought as a straightforward good-vs-evil story make it one of the greatest sequels ever made, and arguably the best of the series."
"It's hard to pick the greatest film in the Star Wars saga. Tough as it is, I must go with Empire Strikes Back. It expertly builds on what made A New Hope work so well, with the added bonus of more confident performances from the cast. The darker tone perfectly fits the story and really hammers home how much trouble the good guys are in. Though there are still a few laughs, the more serious setup allows the stakes to feel greater. As noted, the cast works even better than the original film. The love triangle between Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was hinted at when Leia kissed Luke, but never further than that, so the focus could be on Leia and Han. They succeeded in providing ample screen time for the characters we loved, while also bringing in new ones that remain relatively iconic to this day. Boba Fett, Lando Calrissian and Yoda were all welcome additions for different reasons. The score of the film remains a highlight, while the action and fight sequences are better this time around. I thought the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker final battle was arguably the best in the series. It's not the most impressive looking, but the sheer emotion and beauty of it makes it the most memorable. The film also boasts two of the greatest lines I can ever recall. Solo's ""I know,"" response to Leia's proclamation of love was a perfect character moment, while Vader revealing that he's Luke's father is one of the best twists in cinema history. An absolute classic."
"The sequel to arguably the greatest sci-fi venture of all time is a gem. 
The Empire Strikes Back settles in as one of the greatest sequels of all time, pushing the characters and the story in new and exciting directions."
"The sequel to arguably the greatest sci-fi venture of all time is a gem. 
The Empire Strikes Back settles in easy as one of the greatest sequels of all time, pushing the characters and the story in new and exciting directions."
The best of the original three
"Empire Strikes Back starts with a bumpy plot, dialogue, cinematography, and acting. But as the movie progresses, you start to feel that its a masterpiece. From the beginning of the Battle of Hoth, the movie elevates as it goes on. Every scene feels more mature than what comes before it. The music is perfect in every sense; in fact, it makes the stakes feel more elevated. Darth Vader proves to be the best villain in cinema history, while our protagonists feel much more mature and developed than in 'A New Hope'. For an 80's film, Empire Strikes Back is shot magnificently, and some shots look and feel as modern as many blockbusters today. The film drags at some moments, which is a small downside, aside to the the time measuring which felt out of order especially during Luke's training and the Millennium Falcon's simultaneous escape sequence."
The best Starwars - no credit to Rogue one.
"My favorite movie it is, seriously.
This is a cinematographic jewel as far as science fiction is concerned, the film contains iconic scenes for all generations, besides that it revolutionized the way of making movies of this genre. The film takes a fast and safe rhythm, which unfolds from splendid way, finally giving us to understand that evil won the battle, but not the war, and that the rebellion will return stronger than ever.
Rating: A +"
This is my favorite film of all time!!
What do I need to say?
"Without doubt and hesitation, many people can claim that The Empire Strikes Back is on the list of the greatest films ever made."

"A good sequel, but not a great one. Very overrated."
Was a great movie with a great plot
One of the greatest movies of all time.
Darker tone than the first Star Wars movie. It elevates the tension and the mystery further as the movie goes along. One of the first movies to implement bombshell plot twists and cliffhanger endings. Audiences will be anticipating to watch the sequel after its conclusion.
"A perfect way to hit the high mark of the series,"
"(98/100)
The Original Trilogy..."
One of the most shocking and memorable movie experiences in cinema. Taking a fun new world and diving deep into the psych of its characters and expanding the world while creating a dark tension filled story with iconic imagery and characters and one of the most surprising twists of all time. Empire Strikes Back is one of the definitive sequels and one of the best films put to screen.
"Timeless classic, slightly marred by the useless Special Edition changes."
Cinematic masterpiece best in the Star Wars franchise and that's saying a lot.
No film will ever be this amazing
"By far the greatest movie of the entire saga.  How can you go wrong... Muppet Yoda, Father-son showdown, and an awesome ending were the bad guys win.  Perfect"
The most perfect star wars movie ever!!!!!
Amazing film this is the best in the whole series and let's see if star wars the last Jedi can top it off
"Arguably the best sequel ever made, The Empire Strikes Back is just as amazing as A New Hope."
"It is difficult to make a sequel that can top something as great as Star Wars, but The Empire Strikes Back has easily set the bar for sequels nowadays. It continues A New Hope's story while adding darker and more character moments. Yet again, the special effects are to praise as they have never looked better. However, the biggest praise this movie can get is the fact that they took characters we cared so much about and just made them so much closer to our hearts, by tearing us apart emotionally. The Empire Strikes Back takes the series in a new direction that is darker and more engaging, that the Star Wars films have yet to go back to."
Even better than the last one. In other words more awesome.
one of the best movies
The best Star Wars film
"The best sequel to date, and in my opinion, better than the original 1977 flick."
"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is widely considered one of the definitive ""sequels that are superior to the original"", and for good reason. The film is one of the driving forces in what made Star Wars so popular to begin with. 

The film introduces famous characters and iconic sequences, and tells a story more mature than the original. Whereas ""A New Hope"" plays out similar to that of a fairy tale, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" sheds light to some darker truths: that the heroes don't always come out on top and fighting for what's right can have consequences. 

The film also expands upon the original film, introducing new worlds as well as expanding upon the Empire itself, making it appear more threatening than the first film. The film also solidified Darth Vader as one of the most iconic villains in film history. 

Years later, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" remains a masterpiece and a huge factor into Star Wars' popularity."
Best movie ever fuck everyone else
Star Wars is a pretty intense movie with fighting a lot of action now is the big time to find out so here it is who is Luke Skywalker's father. Choose your side whether you're with Darth Vader or Luke
Amazing best Star Wars film ever
"A rare sequel that is even better than its masterful predecessor, putting itself in one of the greatest films of all time.

Score: 10/10"
What should I say about the film? It's the freaking Empire Strikes Back. It's one of the wonders of the world.
"A coming of age story in the packaging of space fantasy, The Empire Strikes Back is dark, deep and romantic. Artfully written as it builds upon the best parts of the franchise's first installment, while still able to stand on its own. It tells a well rounded narrative about the complexities of making the right decision for the greater good versus the good of a few. It follows three different characters as they deal with the truth of their situations, and as they search for something more. When most of us think of Star Wars, we think of spaceships and planets, but take that away and you still have a strong and emotionally resonant story that works regardless. A true masterpiece in filmmaking that will hopefully continue to enchant audiences for years to come. Good for all ages"
"A film which introduces one of the best plot twists of all time. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie certainly is better than A New Hope apart from the two films connect a common fiber from the whole franchise. This is the time that George Lucas trusted Irvin Kershner as one of the directors of this film. A masterpiece which can be seen from any viewpoint, with improvement from visual effects, the John William's epic score, and the development brutality most villain of Darth Vader and one of the most unforgettable antagonists. This is the Darth Vader movie, doesn't focus too much on Luke where it fails to control his emotions and force. With distinct characters, Han Solo is cooler to Princess Leia, this is the best from the whole trilogy."
The second movie to come out of my favorite movie series! This movie packs an even greater punch than A New Hope and is expertly written by the master George Lucas! The special affects are phenomenal like every Star Wars movie and is a must see for everyone!
This movie is outstanding with a mind blowing twist
The best Star Wars film of them all.
"Luke, I am your father!"
It was amazing. All the haters hate but they got nothin on us star nerds. Best one so far.
Perfection in every sense of the word!!!
Three word movie review:  The very best
"While many believe this Film is the greatest sequel and probably the Best Film ever made i don't quite agree with that statement however I do think this is a great film and is probably the Best Movie in the Star Wars Franchise, this is one of those rare movies that is better then the Original. I think the 1st hour of this Film might be the best 1st hour of a film I've ever seen that's not to say the rest is bad i was still invested with the characters and  their struggles and sitiuations it's just that I thought the First hour was extremely well done with the whole trying to find luke and the hoth battle. The acting was much much better in this film and the characters were all very well developed, complex and had a purpose in this story. I loved Han and leia's relationship and the funny banter between them it really paid off at the end with that emotional ""I know"" moment. Yoda and luke's relationship was also brilliantly done and they had great chemistry and I must say mark hamill was really good in this film he really matured and  you were with him on this journey to become a jedi  I loved how they expanding on the characters and there relationships that's what sequels should do take the characters from the first film to new heights with stakes and emotion. Now let's talk about Vader and the Empire a true force to be reckoned with they actually felt like a truly Unstoppable organisation in this film and you really felt Han,Leia, chewbacca and c3po were in great danger. Vader is a Perfect villian and more importantly you actually understand him in this film and know where's he is coming from and that final confrontation with  Luke and Darth Vader was so emotionally Powerful and obviously that ""I am your Father"" twist still to this day is the best twist in film history truly unexpected. I do have 2 nitpicks and probably will get hate for it as most people call this a perfect film, I thought it felt really long for just a split second when they landed on bespin but after that it started going again and also I didn't really like the character of lando I thought he was typical clichÃ (C) type, betrays friend then regrets it and tries to help him kind of guy it didn't really work for me but other then that this film is great, strong script with well written characters who all have emotional arcs in this film the action was really good especially the epic Hoth Battle, fantastic directing and powerful moments that resonate with you as an audience. Even though and I think this is not a perfect film (no film is perfect) I'm still going to give it 5 out of 5 because of the strong emotional moments it had and the way it expanded on the first film."
"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a flawless movie. Everything is done so well, I can't point out one particular thing wrong. If you somehow haven't seen it, you should!"
"Objectively speaking, the best Star Wars movie."
"Before 'The Dark Knight' came along, this was probably the best sequel to a movie ever. 

The greatest plot twist of all time: ""Luke I am your father!"" Damn that feels good to say! Stakes, great characters, and our introduction to Yoda. A classic film in every sense of the word. 

Do or do not, there is no try...so DO go to broforcesquad.com to check us out."
The Cinematic Masterpiece... Strikes Back Even Better!!!! I love it so much!!!!
"Que puedo decir de esta película que no se halla dicho ya;  es una película increíble, sin duda está en el top de las mejores escuelas, de las mejores sagas y de las mejores películas ya que tiene todo, una dirección impecable, un desarrollo de personajes único con una narrativa exelente, tiene unas increíbles visuales, los aficionados a la fotografía amaran está película, por que de echo para esto se hicieron esta saga, para la fotografía, para las visuales para los efectos especiales muy avanzados a sí época y a su dirección de arte.
Se igual forma tenemos el drama de una de las revelaciones más importantes de la historia del cine; la revelación del paradero del padre de luke, llenado esto de un pasado muy profundo que llena de trama de un gran peso y el soundtrack es fenomenal de los mejores soundtracks que he escuchado en una película y para concluir star wars episodio V: el imperio contraataca sin duda es una película impecable muy completa y la mejor de la saga star wars."
Greatest. Star Wars. Movie. Of. All. Time. Enough Said.
The film's simplicity combined with the infinite wisdom it conveys truly makes it the best installment of the Star Wars saga as well as one of the best films of all time.
My favorite Star Wars movie that I grew up on and has a place in my heart
"If you do not know The Empire Strikes Back is my top film of all time.The Characters are amazing as well as the story and music.Vader is amazing in this movie because he is a B.A also it introduced the Imperial March people.It also introduced one of the best movie characters all time Yoda the wise and kind character who has some of the best lines in the film.Oh yeah the lines in this movie are amazing. ""I am your father""-Vader.Luke vs Vader and The big reveal is my favorite thing in cinema.If you have not seen this movie go see it NOW!!!"
"The movie that flipped the cinema world on its head. The most anticipated sequel of all time. Everything about this movie is bigger and better than the first. We go deeper into the galaxy and the characters that live in it. So many memeroble scenes and lines that will leave you with a warm and broken heart. Empire proves that a sequel can be better than its predecessor. Although darker in tone, it never loses its sense of adventure and thrill that fans got in the original. And lets not forget the greatest twist in cinema history."
The crown jewel of star wars movies. Enough said.
"An absolutely wonderful film. This is not only one the best film in the saga, it is just one of the best films of all time. It is an absolute masterpiece. The acting is magnificent, you really feel the tension that the Rebels feel while being chased by the Empire. Yoda is phenomenal, and one of the most wise characters in all of cinema. Darth Vader is a very menacing antagonist in the movie, with him choking officers left and right. I would have to say my favorite part of the film is the end on Bespin, when Luke and Vader are dueling. It is just so iconic and wonderfully done. The big twist at the end (which I won't reveal because it is just so great) is a complete shock. This is not even a movie, it is an experience. Overall, Episode V is almost too wonderful to even express. If you haven't seen it, stop reading this review, and go see it instantly. I would give 6 stars if I could."
"This is by far, the BEST sequel I have seen PERIOD."
Dad took me and Tommy to see.
"The best Star Wars movie, and one of my  all time favorite movies."
One of the best films and sequels of all time. It introduced almost everything that Star Wars would become. This film also transitioned the series from a simple scifi to space opera. Amazing film.
My favourite movie of all time.
"Seriously guys, must I write out a review for this?"
"A New Hope was already great as it was, but The Empire Strikes Back takes that greatness and multiplies it by a hundred million by going down even darker routes than in the previous film. Also, we get to meet Yoda for the first time ever, who is awesome! Not to mention Darth Vader is one of those bad guys where you don't want to get on his bad side, because if you do, you will pay the price for it, and you will regret making him angry, and that is what makes him such a threatening, menacing, and overall great villain."
People say this is the best it is good but 6 is my favourite 8 might change my mind
VADER: Luke I am your FATHER Fans/Luke: Wait WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My favourite Star Wars film
"The Empire Strikes Back uses shocking revelations, a grimmer tone, and masterful emotional material to succeed as an excellent sequel."
"I know I'm pretty much alone in this judgment, but I did NOT enjoy this as nearly as much as I enjoyed Episode IV A New Hope. Empire Strikes Back feels like it just drags on and on. The ""emotional development"" and the half-assed flirting between characters felt contrived and cringe worthy to me. 

The constant flip flopping between light comedy, light romance, and light action made it feel like the film succeeded at neither of these ideas. Wheras A New Hope immediately pulled me right into the story and landscapes right from the start, The Empire Strikes Back left me bored.  Does anyone else out there feel the acting was cringe-worthy, as well?  Am I the only one who feels this way?  Surely, some of you out there agree with me...right?"
A breathtaking and amazingly well made film on nearly every level.
Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back: Darker and more sinister than the last installment. But still dull and sometimes really boring.
"One of the greatest of the Star Wars saga, possibly even better than the first, The Empire Strikes Back exceeds all expectations."
One of the greatest movies of all time
Arguably the best from the Star Wars saga. Impressive... Most Impressive...
"This movie was somewhat better than the first one. It's darker, more intense, and definitely deserves 5 stars."
probably one of the best american made films ever.  There are no negatives.
ESB is by far the strongest in the OT.  It also showed that a sequel can surpass the first film in every way possible.  Not much is needed to be said about Empire as it's just all around a great film.  More worthy of being on AFI's top 100 than ANH.
"Incredible sci-fi flick. Great characters, plot and action. Best Star-Wars movie undoubtedly."
"Best star wars movie. It's dark and leaves you wanting more. It has a great plot and surprising twist.

9.4/10"
"Luke Skywalker: He told me you killed him.
Darth Vader: No, I Am Your Father.
Luke Skywalker: No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
Darth Vader: Search you feelings you know it could be true. 
Luke Skywalker: Noooooooo! Noooooooo!"
"Easily the best Star Wars film, and one of the best films ever made. Just perfect."
"Delivering one of the most iconic moments in cinema history, Empire remains one of the great films."
"More mature and dark than A New Hope, the one Star Wars film which George Lucas happened to have the least involvement in prior to his departure from the franchise in 2014 is ultimately the best one. Every performance is great, there are some more emotional moments, the ending helps get viewers prepared for Return of the Jedi even if they did have to wait three years for it and one of the biggest reveals in cinematic history is also the most unforgettable plot twist of all time. The Empire Strikes Back is one of those films that is better than the already amazing first film. How do you do that? The action is pretty fun as well with the sequence that wins the honour of my favourite one throughout the entire film was when the Millennium Falcon goes through an asteroid belt in an attempt to get the villain's minions off their tail. The Empire Strikes Back is a sophisticated sci-fi flick in which you'd have difficulty finding something truly worth criticizing. Absolutely flawless."
"(SPOILERS)
This movie has a great twist where....

The little green guy ends up being Yoda! Say what?!"
The greatest movie of all time.
"Better than the original Star Wars! 'The Empire Strikes Back' expands upon the mythology from the first and gives the audience more memorable character moments. 'A New Hope' was needed to set the stage, but this is the definitive Star Wars movie. Improved fight sequences, slightly less corny dialogue, and the first film where we actually get to see Darth Vader as an intimidating presence. Mark Hamill's acting improves and Luke's relationship to Yoda is more interesting than Obi-Wan. And Carrie Fischer continues to make Leia more than a mere damsel in distress. She is an active fighter and stands out as one of the best characters next to Vader."
"Amazing, should have 100%"
"With taking a darker and more serious tone in response to the destruction of the Death Star in the previous episode, The Empire Strikes Back has it all. The villains, the action, the story. It exceeds Ep. 4 in every single regard and stands to be one of the finest films ever made in the action genre."
Great Movie! I Am Glad This Exists
The Empire Strikes Back is one sequel that is as good as the original!
"Foreboding and fast paced, the darkest entry into the original series holds up with the inclusion of new planets, new characters, and double crosses. Plus, after all this time, the big reveal still feels like it matters."
Arguably the best of the original trilogy.
"After setting some of the most iconic characters ever created, the trilogy continues to set up more and better confrontations and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is one of the best sequels of all time! Irvin Kershner may not have been one of the greatest directors but what he did here was simply important for cinema history. This is a two hours long movie that feels like 10 minutes long!"
The best film of the the series by a wide margin.
"This by far... my favorite movie of all time. I thought that it has a lot to offer and I am glad that I started watching the Star Wars movies, or I might not have seen this gem. Everything in this movie is great. This is simply a flawless movie! I love it! I have gone full critic in my past reviews, but I just can't not geek out about this movie it's so good! 50,000/5"
"Even better than A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back is one of the best movies of all time for a reason."
The best of the Star Wars' so far. Everything is just amazing.
"This is a very good movie with a lot of action. 
I watch it a LOT."
"One of the best movies ever made, Empire Strikes Back is a dark but yet magical film which demands your involvelment"
The masterpeice that brought Sci-Fi to the masses
"The best Star Wars movie, in my opinion. Great characters and acting. Yoda and Darth Vader are both excellent characters."
"The best Star Wars film to date hands down. The characters all grow and gain more depth to them. Story beats hit perfectly every time they come up. The writing and directing couldn't have been more spot on. If you are a fantasy sci-fi fan then, this is the movie for you!"
Only one of the franchise who the best and this is the one.
This is by far the best Star Wars movie but it is a little dated when it comes to special effects.
The best Star Wars movie
The best star wars movies still to this day.
The epitome of the saga from a perfect screenplay.  Darth Vader's motives make him a relatable character.
I liked the fight scene between luke and darth vader I can watch it 100 times
"Not only is this the best of the original Star Wars trilogy, this is a great science fiction movie. This is what a sequel SHOULD be. Not only did Empire successfully continue / carry the story along from the first Star Wars , this movie benefitted from strong performances  from all the lead actors/actress and had very strong character development."
"This is, hands down, the best film of the most popular series of films ever made."
The best Star Wars movie of all time and one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.
Just another addition to Star Wars.
"This is my favorite Star Wars movie.  I mean, the lightsaber fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is so awesome, as well as see Yoda mentor Luke.  But my favorite part is when Luke chops the arm of the Wampa!  The connection between Han Solo and Princess Leia is great.  Also, Harrison Ford does great as Han Solo (my favorite Ford role) when he says all those memorable lines.  Also, Yoda, I that guy.  I really do."
"This movie is amazing. It improves on episode 4 in every way. Better action, better CGI, even more characters get introduced and they're great too, the characters from the last movie are more fleshed out and you like them much better. Han Solo is awesome again. This is what sequels should be, improving on the last one, I wish movie sequels now would do that."
"""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"" tetap akan sangat menghibur, memberikan sebuah pengalaman yang fantastis dan sedikit kekecewaan pada unsur ceritanya."
"Seriously, how is this not higher on the list?"
The best star wars movie
"Dull film, got totally bored watching this. I really can't see what all the fuss is about. Watched it a second time unfortunately as I thought perhaps I wasn't in the right mood, but no, it still bored me. Many say it's the best in the series, but I think it's the worst. Yes even Phantom Menace is better than this highly overrated dross. I will probably watch the whole series back to back at some point but not looking forward to having to sit through this one again."
"This Movie is great, That's really all I have to say. Although it's not MY favorite, I think this is the best Star Wars Film!"
This is the best Star Wars movie and one of the best movies of any franchise. Everything looks real for 1980.
One of the best films ever. The action doesn't stop at all!
"An excellent and rather perfect Star Wars film, that is well balanced and well played. This is one of the most outstanding sci-fi classics in history!"
"Not only the best Sci-fi films of all time, but one of the greatest movies ever made, perfect in almost every way."
Best Star Wars movie in the entire franchise!!!!
One of the best movies of all time!
the best star wars movie. and one of the best movies of all time
A great Star Wars movie! It is even better than Episode IV! This movie has a great amount of iconic quotes used all around the globe and has a great storyline too! It is a great Star Wars movie!
The absolute greatest movie ever made!
"Lots of action and drama . It follows our heroes through very difficult times, including one of the greatest plot twists in cinematic history."
Great Star Wars film. I personally prefer episode 4 but still amazing
My favorite movie of all time. Best movie ever made!! I have no words to describe how awesome this movie is.
The Force is strong in this defining chapter in the Star Wars saga. Most impressive.
"'Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son'

Setting out to make a sequel to the outrageously successful Star Wars and making one of the best received blockbusters ever made. 

Empire is incredible. Thrilling and expansive. Our heroes are in real trouble being relentlessly pursued through the galaxy by the seemingly endless supply of Imperial forces led by the murderous Darth Vader. Their trusty ship is falling apart, their paths (and in some cases body parts) diverge and it ends on a bit of a downer. Frank Oz's puppet work is excellent as Jedi Master Yoda creating the most believable puppet character (in spite of sounding a bit Miss Piggy at times) it creates real stakes real peril and   gets so much right. 

This is the episode to beat. search your feelings, you know it to be true.

'do or do not, there is no try.'"
"As a kid I mostly watched Star Wars 4, 5, 6, and 1, but the one I recall watching the most is episode 5. As a kid, I loved watching that final battle. It was my favorite and still is! It was visually interesting, it was iconic, it was atmospheric, it was intense, it was a pure good guy vs. bad guy battle that offered more than it needed to. Way more! The rest of the movie focuses on Luke's training and Han doing his best to escape the Empire. There's plenty of interesting moments during Luke's training that will forever remain in my mind. Yoda revealing his identity, Luke's vision in the cave, Yoda raising the ship, it's all just REALLY well done! Han escaping the Empire had some cool moments, but it doesn't really go anywhere until Han gets to Cloud City where some serious business goes down. This movie didn't give us another happily-ever-after story, it had the balls to give a darker ending where the heroes didn't come out all victorious. Han Solo gets captured, Luke loses his battle with Vader as well as his hand, and he now has to cope with the fact that the most menacing figure in the galaxy aside from The Emperor is his father! That reveal at the end can't shock anyone now the way it did when people first saw it, but when people DID first see it, holy hell... 5 stars!"
best star wars movie
BY FAR MY FAVORITE OUTTA ANY OF THE FILMS!
The greatest movie in the Star Wars franchise which perfectly combines great acting with great scriptwriting but best of all an incredible twist which will change your whole interpretation of Darth Vadar.
"George Lucas offers up the entree of his saga: if A New Hope was the setup, 'Empire' is the conflict. Unlike its predecessor which teetered on silliness, Lucas breathes complexity into familiar characters, with Luke and Darth Vader being the centerpiece. The biospheres of Hoth, Dagobah, and Bespin create fantastic backdrops for Luke's emotional growth as he comes to terms with internal peril, and the daring escapades of Han and Leia feel like a good sci-fi TV show with a burgeoning romance sub-plot."
"ESB is darker, scarier, the stakes are raised higher, and it is also better. The special effects grow in their quality and magnitude, but most of all the storytelling gets that much better, without sacrificing any of the spirit of the original. A rare sequel that improves over the original movie (which was iconic in its own right), ESB is as good as movies get."
"By far one of my most favorite Star Wars films to date. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is considered by popular public opinion to be the greatest Star Wars film of all time, and for good reason. This is Star Wars at it's finest here!"
Best movie of all time...
"Very gritty and different, shocking reveal, epic duel, battle of Hoth, and different views of almost every character."
"The acting is not as good as the trendy hype insists. Stop this destructive conflict of rating ""cult"" films at a god level and once again bring balance to the force."
"The empire strikes back takes everything from the first thing and builds on it. It adds new planets like Hoth and introduces new characters like Yoda, Boba Fett and Lando. The film also includes arguably the most iconic twist in the plot ever. I could easily talk for longer but chances are you've already seen it and already know why it's so good. This is easily my favourite film ever made and has been since I was about 5 years old, I think it's safe to say that this film made a huge impact on my childhood."
best star wars movie out of all of them
This was the greatest of them all
"Star Wars the empire strikes back is a masterpiece, it is and will always be one of the best films ever made, because the whole entire movie is flawless. This by far is one of the best sequels ever made in film history. And the movie is so original and I love how it doesn't want to play it safe. This isn't just another Star Wars movie, it's a grand space opera, with themes of love, family and destiny, it's by far the best Star Wars movie in the whole series."
"What else can I say? this movie is a masterpiece. The tone, the build-up, the twist, everything about this movie screams PERFECTION to me"
"This movie is great. It has everything you could want from a Star Wars movie. It has immortal quotes, a fantastic plot, great characters, and the greatest plot twist in movie history. However, there is one problem--nothing in this movie struck me as new, which keeps this from being better than at least three other entries."
Greatest film of all time. Darker and better than A New hope and the movies stars shine more than ever.
"Not many Space Operas can reach the level of of this one. The introduction of Yoda, the relationship between Han and Leia, the increased screen time of Darth Vader, and most importantly the development of Luke Skywalker all culminate in one of the best-made blockbusters ever."
"""Not only is this the best 'Star Wars' sequel, this is the best 'Star Wars' movie of all time! It shows how the Empire were striking back at the rebellion and that was done so freaking well! With a new story, a few new characters, showing how Darth Vader can be a frightening villain, and the biggest plot twist of all time, and you'll get a phenomenal 'Star Wars' film of all time!"""
"Probably the BEST star wars movie ever made!! Darker, enjoyable, and much better than New Hope in many ways! LOVE IT!!"
A visually stunning masterpiece with a great story.  A worthy sequel to Episode 4.
One of the all-time best.
"The Empire Strikes Back falls in that special ""Perfect"" category. I wouldn't change anything about this movie. The golden standard of any sequel."
The Empire Strikes Back raises the stakes from its predecessor with edgy twists and a great climax.
"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is another GREAT Star Wars movie that is actually a little more better than A New Hope. The cast and the characters are again perfect in the film. Director Irvin Kershner does an even greater work with the film, and again John Williams score is PERFECT and LEGENDARY!"
"Empire Strikes Back is the best sequel ever made and the best Star Wars film. Not too mention the movie holds some of the ,past memorable fight scenes and one the greatest plot twist in cinema history."
"The Empire Strikes Back is the rare kind of sequel that honors its predecessor, bringing the characters that audience already love to a new and more emotionally mature adventure."
Svårt att följa en sån bra föregångare!
Arguably the greatest sci-fi/fantasy film ever made. Simply legendary.
It is a great addition to the star wars series and is a must watch if you are going to see the other movies.
"I was not as impressed by this film as I had expected to be. There was nothing wrong with it, I just was not left in awe and wonder after seeing it."
"Bigger and more ambitious than it's predecessor, this film has stood the test of time and shows us the best of Star Wars. It's just phenomenal."
"I don't care if it was great during it's time,with today's standards it is even worse than transformers."
"""I am your father""!
Empire Strikes back is the best movie in the Star Wars Saga. A complete masterpiece and well adaptation of the greatest cinema villain- Darth Vader."
The best and darkest of the Star Wars films
Best in the whole series.
"there's something incredibly dumb about this movie and it's the fact that it isn't the true introduction of Boba Fett. his true introduction was the star wars holiday special, one of the worst movies ever made. the battle of hoth is one of the best movie battles ever put to film. Darth Vader and Han Solo are two of the best movie characters ever made. the lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is the best lightsaber fight in the entire star wars movie francise.


Owens grade: B+"
Realistic emotion with dark secrets that will surprise millions to this day even fans that have seen the film during its release.
"Very good film. Nothing else to say about this movie... In my book, its a classic!"
This movie is perfect can't think in one scene that I didn't enjoy
This series is getting better!
"Dramatic Sci-fi sequel that all other similar genre movie endeavour to match, but rarely come close."
"An explosive start with the battle of Hoth, the biggest ground battle in the saga's history until the battle of Geonosis in episode II. Seeing Boba Fett is a treat and the constant twists in space along with the theme music makes for a great ride."
Greatest sequel ever made.
"The Empire Strikes Back is the greatest sequel of all time. PERIOD. Words cannot describe how much I love this movie, so I won't try to. 

I'll just say this, not only do I recommend this movie, but it is one of the few movies you have to see before you die, and if you somehow haven't seen it, drop everything and make a run for your television or your phone so you can watch it."
Quite simply the best that Star Wars has to offer. This development of the franchise offers even more brilliance than A New Hope. A must watch.
Much more interesting film than all the others.
Engaging all the way through and the darker tone really sets this movie up there with my favorite movies ever. The plot twist ever was also one of the best in science fiction history.
Here is a sequel in which lives up to its extraordinary glory just as its' legendary predecessor did.
Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars yet. It has great Life Saber battles and takes us into the world of Ewoks. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
"Empire Strikes Back is one of the main examples of a sequel better than the original. This movie starts strong with the Battle of Hoth and grips onto your imagination and never lets go. With the introduction of the incredibly wise Yoda and my favourite Star Wars character, Boba Fett.This movie ends with the greatest plot twist ever put on screen. Fortunately, Empire was the least changed out of the original Star Wars trilogy in the Special Editions, with the positive change being able to see the Wampa. Lucas probably understood that Empire was already a perfect movie and didn't need CGIbominations in every shot."
It's just perfect.  no other words can describe it
"The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel that tops the original in the best way with a much darker and edgier tone, tragic drama, high stakes, more character development, and a bittersweet cliffhanger ending that make it the best Star Wars film and one of the greatest films of all time."
"Best Star Wars film in the franchise. This movie took what A New Hope gave us in a completely unexpected direction and had audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. I think the acting of the original Star Wars cast in this film is the best we've gotten the pleasure to see, the story is told perfectly and the plot is dark and surprisingly had a lot of tension. This film wasn't afraid to end on a bad note and that just adds to its legendary status among movie goers."
I could watch this installment of the saga again and again... and I have.
easily the greatest movie ever
A fantastic sequel to 'A New Hope' this film has captivated audiences for years and with the epic 'Imperial March' by John Williams this film is worth a watch for both young and old!
"Works on so many levels for some reason. Even if I wanted to, I have nothing to complain about."
"Talk about a sequel that does everything right. Not only does this film manage to surpass the original film in every possible way, but its darker tone and much more mythical aspect is truly amazing. The only tiniest of flaws is that it can rarely get a tad boring with character development in only a couple of scenes, but that's on a personal level. While I may prefer the original film in personal taste, I do acknowledge that this film truly is superior in every way. It is the best of the Star Wars films."
"It,s a good star wars film"
"One of my all time favorite movies. Special effects that hold up to this day, along with some of the best science fiction/fantasy storytelling. A must watch for anyone interested in the adventures to be had in a galaxy far far away."
"The best Star Wars film that has been made, and probably will ever be made. An instant classic."
Continued strength of the sequel spreads the drama far beyond the first episode. This film had heartbreaking twists and a powerful battle of the rebels and the empire.
"The Empire Strikes Back defies all chances and makes a sequel better than the orginal in every way with better well thought out characters,more humor,more risks for the rebels and adding a chance of losing to the empire and as our main protagonist becomes a powerful and more wise version slowly throughout"
"One of the greatest sequels ever made , the best Star Wars chapter ever , one of my all time favorites"
"One of my favorite movies of all time, this movie arguably made a bigger impact on movies now than its predecessor and is for sure my favorite star wars film period."
"Although admittedly inferior to A New Hope, the second and fifth Star Wars entry is the most cerebral and best acted film in the saga."
Star Wars Empire Strikes Back was a good start of rebuilding a backstory between each other about revealing the truth power of Darth Sidious in his backstory to overthrow the Republic after when Anakin Skywalker had to face his son Luke Skywalker in a devastating lightsaber fight Luke makes his final Escape this was a terrific way to finish the back story of this movie.   give me a 10.9
"I find when writing about Star Wars, all my tenses get mixed up. The first released trilogy came before the first three episodes and now we're getting not only sequential ""sequels"" but parallel stories too. Who knows where it will end? After the brash, joyous first (or fourth) Star Wars movie came the second (or fifth) instalment, The Empire Strikes Back. Coming three years after ""A New Hope"", Empire was a darker, perhaps more downbeat tale both in tone and sentiment. For me, this is/was the best of the the films so far just edging the previous instalment in a number of areas. It continued the plot in a credible and exciting way, developing the characters we had met before and introducing some noteworthy new ones. In particular we got the first screen appearance of the Emperor and the wonderfully realised Yoda. This little, loveable, wise character is imbued with such character and life that you really do forget that he is a puppet. Everything works about him and sadly, in his future (and past) appearances, he never really worked quite as well again. Frank Oz gave him not  an instantly recognisable and easily imitated voice and also managed to create a personality that was recognisably human and heartwarming. Some of the action sequences in Empire are just superb. For me, the stand out scene is the sight of the Imperial Walkers attacking the rebel base on Hoth. I remember well seeing the sight of those immense, walking AT-ATs on the big screen as a child and being thrilled. It's a scene that still fills me with a sense of excitement and I don't think has really been equalled for scale and spectacle. The established cast return to their characters, noticeably older and more assured in their performances. On-screen, the three leads bounce off each other well creating a real chemistry between the characters. There is a doom laden air to the action and it all builds up to the cliffhanger ending nicely. Every aspect of The Empire Strikes Back works brilliantly and it still gives me just as much a of thrill to watch it now as it did back in 1980."
Has one of the best twists ever has a variety of planets that are explored and continues on to the story perfectly
"The perfect Star Wars movie with exciting moments, witty dialogue , a great story more great characters and the best movie twist of all time."
What home never new movies to get the good
Classic.  'nuff said
Best Star Wars movie to ever grace the screen and Best Sequel of the 20th Century!
A neat little unknown indy flick that will hopefully be famous someday.
"Very good Star Wars
Movie"
"This film is without a doubt the best movie ever made, I could watch this movie over and over again it is that fantastic"
"My personal favorite of all Star Wars love action love spoilers love all of it

Lots of story and twist and surprises"
"The Empire Strikes Back is darker and characters reach new emotional levels than in the first Star Wars film. The introduction of Yoda is fantastic as he provides comic relief, but he becomes more serious once you learn his true identity. Darth Vader's character really wasn't as involved in the last film but in Empire Strikes Back we learn much more about his character. This is definitely the most serious Star Wars and also happens to be the best."
"The sequel to Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back is visually stunning, thought provoking, and full of amazing characters. Truly a perfect movie."
The Empire Strikes Back is an absolute masterpiece that is my favorite movie of all time thanks to its terrific story and introduction to even more great characters.
Favorite Star Wars film
The Empire Strikes Back is a testament of pure perfection due to paralleling the development and sinister tone of both the characters and diverging stories respectively
Arguably the best sci-fi action film of all time.
The best Star Wars ever
One of the rare sequels where it is better than the original.
"Proof that if George Lucas wants his intellectual property to grow and flourish, he should lay the ground work and then take a step back and let it develop on its own. This is evident in the leap in story depth and character development from A New Hope to Empire Strikes Back. Maybe he should have let someone else take over screenplay writing and directing after Phantom Menace. This film really does get deeper into the characters and is definitely the best film in the first trilogy. Sets are extraordinary and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian (aka the only black guy in George Lucas's universe) was excellent. They ended the film in a perfect place making the audience crave to know what happens next. The film gives us a chance to grow even more with the characters from A New Hope and has a massive reveal toward the end (at least to those that saw it in the 80s)."
"Perfect movie, nothing better"
"When they say that sequels are better than the original, they're usually right. And The Empire Strikes Back lives up to that saying."
"Empire is darker and more sinister than it's predecessor, but that's a good thing, because, in my opinion, it's better than A New Hope by having better dialogue, better action, great performances, and great special effects, just like A New Hope, that make this film, like it's predecessor a masterpiece"
"Star Wars is what cinema is all about. Creative work, originality, charm, memorable characters, and the truest form of art and entertainment. These films truly bring you to another world that resonates a feeling of familiarity. People and cultures from all edges of our world are brought together by these films, and with an impact that large, you just know that it's something special. 

Star Wars always had the cutting edge effects of its age and, to this day, still proves to be incredibly entertaining. I find myself many times just smiling throughout the film out of pure enjoyment as I get to witness timeless cinema.

After the first release of Star Wars, Mark Hamil, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fischer became icons over night. Even today when they were back on the big screen for The Force Awakens, they had the presence of legends. 

Star Wars is where imagination comes to life for not only children, but for adults as well. Star Wars is the reason for so many people to become involved with film, and this reason alone is one of many reason why Star Wars is one of the greatest films in of all time.

The production of the films is what I love the most to see in cinema. The practical effects of puppetry, modeling, painting, stop motion animation and countless other artistic talents are combined into each and every one of Star Wars' original trilogy. The reason why the newer Star Wars trilogy wasn't received as well is because those films lost all of the artistic talent that was put into the original trilogy.

Very few films are or ever will be like Star Wars. 

Star Wars: 5 stars
The Empire Strikes Back: 5 stars
Return of the Jedi: 4.5 Stars"
"Hands down one of the best sequels I've seen in any movie. The story, the characters, the plot twist, etc. It's all there and better than ever. Even though it's not my favorite Star Wars movie (Episode III), it takes #2 for the best Star Wars experience you can get. Great villains and go see it. I'll guarantee you'll love it!!"
"One of the vest movies of all time, period."
"I could barely tolerate the scenes with Han and Leia, but otherwise..."
The best Star Wars film and the one of the best films ever period
"Dark and gritty, This installment of Star Wars is very suspenseful and basically invented the ""Plot Twist"""
"Star Wars was a smashing success, even though some didn't have the most faith in the project to begin with. Everyone was talking about the film and soon afterwards a sequel was announced and the excitement began to build. With a different director at the helm, The Empire Strikes Back was able to exceed the original, while also immersing fans even more into the saga.

Beginning three years after the Rebel's victory over the death star, Episode V wastes no time in living up to its namesake. The Empire really is coming down on the rebellion like a ton of bricks, having forced them out of their base on Yavin IV and pushing them to a final planetary base on Hoth. After a devastating armoured assault that puts the rebels on the run, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) head off in opposite directions. Luke, with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in tow plots a course to Dagobah to enter the more intensive aspects of his Jedi training, while Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) evade the Empire's grasp, all the while contending with a faulty Millennium Falcon. By dividing the film into these plot threads, Episode V gives and seamlessly shifts between two distinctive tones; Luke's story builds further intrigue in the nature of the force, whilst Han, Leia and company is like an endless chase sequence, one which never loses its fast-paced intensity. The way in which the Empire relentlessly pursues our heroes gets us emotionally invested in their struggle and serves another reminder that the villains are more determined than ever to crush the rebels. The two stories eventually meet up, building to what is easily the most shocking twist in film history; suddenly the entire mythos of the Star Wars universe is flipped on its head, leaving the audience blown away and begging for more. With its leaner and darker plot, Episode V does what any great sequel should, continue the story and continue to surprise and thrill film-goers at every turn.

Episode V expands massively on the already memorable characters of the trilogy while also introducing a few new ones. Yoda (Frank Oz) is a puppet made to perform in front of the camera, and yet he's such a fascinating and likeable character. Despite his humorous yet senile outward appearance, what lies on the inside is a massive wealth of knowledge and heart that draws you in to Luke's training in the force. On the opposite end of the film, we have Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) a terrifically suave character who plays off Han Solo really well before eventually jumping into the action. The three main characters from A New Hope are split up for most of the film, and this allows the narrative to home in on each of their personal stories. Luke undergoes a change which is more psychological than physical in this movie; he desires to learn and train in the use of the force, but his insecurity, anxiety and somewhat overconfident attitude raises doubts about the path he is taking. There are moments where you wonder if the protagonist has made the right choices and this makes him that much more relatable. Han and Leia undergo a very believable and well realised emotional journey that builds over the course of the film; by the time the more sinister events begin to befall our heroes, it creates a strong emotional punch that again highlights how powerful the Empire really is. Whilst the heroes have gone deeper in their relationships with each other, the villains have grown more menacing. Vader (James Earl Jones) has become twice as ruthless as he was in the first film; he will not tolerate failure and this is clearly shown as he severely punishes his lieutenants for their errors. He commands every scene whenever he is present, the Imperial officers watching with their nervous faces and body language wondering who will be next to feel his wrath. Empire Strikes Back also introduces us to the Emperor (Ian Mcdiarmid) and even though it's very brief, you're left wondering what role he will play and how deep his evil reaches. The characters of Episode V are ultimately more memorable and investing, their personal stories becoming far more prevalent than they were before.

Staying true to what worked in the original, the special effects in The Empire Strikes Back are more progressive than innovative in their execution. That's not to say that the effects have taken a step back from the original film. Far from it in fact as the practical models convey an increased scale. The lumbering behemoth AT-AT walkers feel both powerful and imposing in the way they easily best the rebels in the film's first action sequence. Space battles have also received an upgrade with the asteroid field serving a brilliant source of tension, upping the stakes and making us fear for the character's survival. While most of the filming was done using practical sets and effects, the highlights of which being the hallways of Cloud City and the swamps of Dagobah, the on-set shooting in Norway goes far towards getting across the chilling and icy surface of Hoth. The greatest leap forward though comes from the music; John Williams really outdid himself here. The Hoth and Imperial March themes add an even higher degree of power to the Empire's presence this time around, whilst Yoda's theme is more simplistic, highlighting the Jedi Master's subtle and deceiving identity.

The Empire Strikes Back is an excellent sequel to Star Wars in every way, but to leave it there would be doing it a great disservice. This is a film that stands head and shoulders above every other main entry in the saga, bringing its plot and characters to the forefront. Of all the films, games and numerous other contributions to George Lucas's epic space opera, there is nothing I can recommend more than this film."
"AMAZING! My all time favorite movie! Chilling, intense, dark, and stunning with timeless special effects! A must see for everyone!"
"Not just one of the best star wars movies, but maybe one of the best movies ever, it has everything you want from a movie."
My personal favorite of the franchise!ð???
