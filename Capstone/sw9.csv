"This movie and this trilogy overall should be used as a guide to teach people ""how to ruin successful franchises"""
"In the final chapter of the Skywalker saga, J.J. Abrams tries to course correct from plot decisions made in ""The Last Jedi,"" and while the film may lack originality, Abrams still delivers a nostalgic sci-fi adventure with superb performances and some spectacular action - specifically a water-soaked lightsaber battle between Kylo Ren and Rey at the remains of the Death Star."
"Snip snip snip snip snip snip snip, Reylo  Kiss. Rise Of Palpatine"
The worst Star Wars movie ever made. Completely invalidates Luke Skywalkers story arc. Also no one actually even cares about the plot anymore and instead just want to see the 1000 different lens flares and special effects.
"L'attesissimo capitolo finale della nuova trilogia di Star Wars è una delusione totale. Dopo un'introduzione assolutamente perfetta, ideata e confezionata da J. J. Abrams, un secondo capitolo problematico, che vede il nuovo regista Johnson portare sostanziosi cambiamenti narrativi a tutto ciò che si era instaurato nel film precedente, ecco il gran finale, un film caotico che con molte difficoltà manifesta incertezza e indecisione dall'inizio alla fine. Si cerca di riparare la netta rottura narrativa presente tra i primi due capitoli, e senza una linea guida si cerca di salvare il salvabile offrendo agli spettatori ciò che si pensa possano apprezzare. Il risultato è un film con grossi problemi narrativi, un film che non si riesce a connettere con nessuno dei due primi capitoli. Il principale responsabile di questo fallimento è, a mio avviso, proprio il cambio di regista tra i primi due film: è stata data troppa libertà creativa a Johnson, il quale ha offerto una sua visione di Star Wars, totalmente distaccata rispetto all'idea originale di partenza. Nonostante questo, la regia generale è molto valida e tutti gli aspetti tecnici sono assolutamente perfetti, con fotografia, scenografie ed effetti visivi sempre sopra la media. Gli enormi problemi narrativi non sono sorvolabili e rovinano tutto il feeling generale dell'intera trilogia. Purtroppo il film rischia di essere il peggior film su Star Wars che sia mai stato fatto."
"Absolutely abhorrent,  The entire film is dedicated to reconning the previous film. Leading to a very boring and irritating course of events."
"The movie wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't great either. They spent way too much time in the two previous films tearing down all our heroes and then realized they had made a mistake, so they tried to prop them all back up. It didn't work. Sorry. You burned that bridge with The Last Jedi and with all the social media attacks on the fans that didn't like what you did to their heroes. I mean, when you have stars and film makers attacking the fans, you've lost the narrative. Even Marvel hasn't learned that lesson, but it is Disney, so I guess it's to be expected."
better than episode 8
"I did not hate this at all! They tied up all the loose ends and plenty of fun action sequences. Sure it was clunky, but aren't all Star Wars movies? Solid concept, solid execution."
"This was the worst out of the new saga, character choices were dubious all round, *do you take the quick kill or the hard kill, whyyyy...
And how many  times can you hijak an empire destoryer?! Really.
No chemistry between charachters, made me crinje the whole time, story line was robotic, why did they even bother?"
Just a waste of time and money. I can't believe how badly they ruined this franchise.
"Much better than I thought it would be, and largely due to the performances. Ridley and Driver are again amazing. And I nearly welled up over the scene with Carrie Fisher."
Awful attempt at finishing one of the greatest franchises of all time. Do not waste your time unless you want to see some cool special effects.
"Its not the size of the threat or consequence if the heros lose that make you care its your emotional investment in it. You can find thousands of movies that have very small scale problems with small scale consequences if the heros fail that can still bring you into the stroy and make you seriously care. Just look at love stories.  If the couple doesn't get together and fall in love in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter but it can still bring you to tears. The rise of skywalker is centered around 1,000 deathstars and wow what a surprise that no one cared and the fans weren't invested in it"
The best thing about this film is that it signals the end of the current trilogy that started off great and got progressively worse.
"I went into the movie with a lot of questions, but when I left, I had more questions than I did answers"
"it was kinda just boring, like Rays character arc failed in my opinion, it was nothing new, or that i hadn't seen before"
"ruins the whole main star wars arc 
this movie ruins all of star wars"
"Lame, stale, lacks presence, short on acting talent and is just old appearing."
I totally enjoyed the movie. I think it was an amazing way to end the Skywalker saga and you could totally feel the Star Wars energy during the movie. The character development of Rey and Ben was brilliant and emotionally complex and you can tell it is a more poetical version of the previous movies.
"Good visual, very visual so much visual. Story ? Confusing.. is it a new trilogy or stand alone ? I wish I was 16y again to feel less confuse ...seriously I only watch it for the visual after seeing it twice really cool"
"A fitting end to the Skywalker saga. I thoroughly enjoyed it, plenty of adventure, action, emotion and surprises along the way.  The references to every aspect of Star Wars on the big and small screen was a nice touch.  I do feel there were some missed opportunites like the Knights of Ren, but as a life-long Star Wars fan I loved it overall."
Screws over all the original movies
"good movie 
entertaining
i really like palpatine returns but actually that could be better"
"The movie was poorly thought out, and clearly only focused on pleasing the generation that grew up with the first trilogy, at the expense of the storylines of the new characters. The newly introduced characters like Finn, Rose and Poa could have had much better stories and well thought out backgrounds and motivations. They should have had a more concentrated bad guy because kylo was clearly conflicted since the beginning of the trilogy and then bringing in palpatine had no correlation to the new generation. It seems they had no plan to actually give the characters purpose, they just wanted to tie up there stories, and they didn't do it in a good way."
"Bummer.
It appears that the plan to remake the original Star Wars trilogy despite the Lucasfilm contract of sale explicitly prohibiting alteration of the Lucas Era films was carried out. Working so hard to get a callback shot of Chewie in chains ... member that?
Like every story post buyout it's big on flash and low on substance. Like scavenging, every idea in these new films was picked up because the creative individual who collaborated to build the Star Wars universe left it behind.
Criminally unimaginative."
"The overall feeling through the whole movie is that too many things are happening too fast and for no reason.
The relationship with the new characters introduced in this movie looks forced and fake because they didn't spend time in developing them.
It seems like the wanted to undo everything set on The Last Jedi, and ran out of time to tell the story straight.
Sadly a huge let down for any fan of the series and just a bad movie."
"I series of badly put together scenes with awful acting. I finally decided to see it, downloaded, I didnt even bother to go to the cinema, and I was not disappointed, it was as bad as expected. 
Watch the animated series instead much better stories and fights and for some reason they make sense. I have rewatched them several times not sure I will do with this sequal trilogie."
"It was really, really good. Many people feel it was rushed and that things were not explained properly, and there is truth in that. On the other hand it is such a treat that I think it would be a disservice to oneself to scrutinize how they found a Sith knife or how exactly how that helped them find a Wayfinder. Sure, I would sometimes have preferred something more plausible, but these are just story telling apparatus that doesn't detract from the real joy of the overall experience."
"This movie was awful. It breaks so many in-universe laws and destroys the lore. Not to mention, the pacing is awful, just going from action set piece to action set piece as well as the lazy writing. They bring back Palpatine (ruining the Chosen One prophecy) and don't even bother to explain how! The amount of plot holes and continuity errors are countless. The lightsaber fight is also extremely underwhelming. It has no music, no emotional value, and treats lightsabers like medieval battle axes weighing hundreds of pounds. Absolutely awful. It tries to cram way too much stuff into one movie. And the ending is just unbelievable. The amount of frustration that comes from the line Rey says at the end is unimaginable (unless you've seen the movie, of course). This movie is a disgrace to Star Wars and an insult to film making."
A weak way to end this newer trilogy. It's a lazy film that will barely keep your attention. The worst of the Star Wars franchise to date. (First and only viewing - 5/10/2020)
Worst movie since Phantom Menace.
"Emporer palpatine coming back completely negates the entire Skywalker trilogy! Anakin Skywalkers arc from episode 1 to 3 was him slowly being manipulated by palpatine until he eventually palpatine turned him and Anakin had no will to turn on his master. In 4-5 he learns that he has a son, and this almost transforms his mind to thinking that he doesn't need the emporer anymore. In 6 he overcomes his fear and "" kills "" the emprorer, thus completing his massive 6 movie arc and this sees the prophecy of the chosen one fulfilled, he finally brings balance to the force. Now with palpatine back, none of that matters. Another thing was the completely rushed pace of the movie. There is also a lot of lazy editing and plot holes the size of a galaxy. Another thing is the terrible lazy writing and the use of something called a "" maguffin "". A maguffin is an object that solely exist to advance the plot and is something that terrible writers use when they have no other way to advance said plot. In this movie the maguffin is the sith way finder, which serves no other purpose than to advance the plot through the finding of these objects. Another huge thing that annoys me about this movie is how they tried to copy the pivotal moment in Avengers Endgame at the end of this movie. In Endgame Thanos says "" I am inevitable "" and then Iron man says "" and I, am iron man "" and then snaps, Blowing away Thanos and saving the day. In ROS palpatine says "" I am all the sith "" and then Rey says "" and I, am all the Jedi"" blowing him away and saving the day. The main thing about this movie that still absolutely pisses me off is how at the end she calls herself skywalker. How fucking dare you call yourself a name that you have not earned! The entire movie everyone is preaching how you shouldn't be afraid of who you really are, and then Rey decides to hide it all behind a fake name that is respected throughout the galaxy. All in all this is a complete failure as a movie and as a peice in the Star Wars trilogy. I encourage anyone who is reading this to watch the original trilogy and Revenge if the sith in the prequel trilogy if you want to know what compelling stories and plots look like in a Star Wars movie. I would never recommend any true Star Wars fan watch this movie. I'm not actually sure who likes this movie."
"My first viewing of this movie was that it was okay.  The Last Jedi had done so much damage to the Star Wars franchise that no single movie could undo that mess within only a couple hours.  But Abrams did the best he could and found a way to make it all work.  The death of Carrie Fisher seriously affected the development of this movie and it shows in the storyline which seems nonsensical on many levels.  Upon my second viewing, I started seeing more of this movie start to shine.  Critics scoff at the so-called ""fan service.""  But there's a difference between mocking ""fan service"" and showing respect on established canon.  I appreciated seeing people like Wedge make this movie.  Ultimately, this third trilogy fails to conclude the Skywalker story arc because The Last Jedi had removed the setup from The Force Awakens, forcing Abrams to rush the trilogy conclusion into 2 hours rather than the summed 7-8 hours for a trilogy.  But even though the third trilogy didn't elevate the franchise, 2 of the 3 movies were enjoyable.  But I do wish there was another movie with Rey at the forefront.  I feel they could've done more with her.  And please bring back more dynamic lightsaber fights.  The sword action of this trilogy was so lumbering.  The last act near the very end began to have that faster dynamic action that was reminiscent of the prequel trilogy."
"Man, they really took it seriously when we asked ""could they can make it any worse than the Last Jedi?""
It's bad, it's really bad, first Star Wars I've fallen asleep while watching it."
Lost continuity with the prior movie but more fun than the last movie that is the worst of all of the series so meh.
"The main problem for ‘The Rise of Skywalker' (and for JJ Abrams in the writer/director's chair) is that it has to (re)correct the course that the previous film set, undo as many mistakes as possible, and somehow tie up everything and everyone's stories from the previous eight films. That's a tall order, maybe an impossible one. Inevitably, it feels messy and disconnected, not leaving anywhere near enough time to cover everything and deliver a focused effort. 

The newest trilogy as a whole is, arguably, a disappointing affair that just went wrong in too many places. Nevertheless, considering all of the above, Abrams' has done an admirable job with the final film that shouldn't be too disappointing, at least for casual fans; that is to say, there are a lot of epic scenes that utilise a lot of the best things about the ‘Star Wars' universe and, just as importantly, some great character development in the right direction."
"Maybe if you are the new caretakers for a much loved franchise, and you're adding a final trilogy, you might think of planning a full coherent storyline that is respectful to everything before it, and is a trilogy worthy on its own merits.
Disappointing."
"The Long-awaited installment to finally end this train wreck of a trilogy, and boy this does not help in the slightest. (Quick side note, I totally didn't pay to see Uncut Gems and then sneak in to see Star Wars as a protest against Disney and not wanting to give them my hard-earned money). The Marketing itself as the end of a nine-part saga with JJ Abrams himself stated in multiple interviews but more feel like it's the merciful end to this jumbled mess of a Trilogy that lost it stride as soon as The Last Jedi was released and immediately became controversial among the fan base and mainstream Hollywood critics praising the film to no end. When I first saw TLJ in theaters despite the issues I had with it on the spot I had a blast but after a few days critical thinking it made less and less the flaws became more apparent and more kept popping up, and the Humor was not only childish but Inter fears with scenes that could have added great dramatic tension. Now fan backlash for questionable decisions is nothing new in this franchise dating back to the holiday special the sequels and prequels, but the backlash to this film and how it was handled left a fatal rift not just between critics and audiences but in the fan base itself because whenever its brought up it's like bringing up politics in the middle of a holiday dinner 🍽 table with some very opinionated in-laws, it almost always boils down to shouting matches, name-calling, animosity between each other, and in the process ruin everyone else's a good time. 
Now for the movie itself as it is every bit as disappointing as the leaks made it out to be and it feels like it was hacked together by constant reshoots, re-edits, test screening, and rushed last-minute ideas that were given no thought or time to develop naturally in the story. For example, it's obvious to any Star Wars fan even if they only watch the theatrically released movies 🎥 that The Emperor's return makes absolutely no sense in the context of this trilogy story as his story clearly ended in 1983 with Return of the Jedi along with Anakin's redemption and the Skywalker saga. With the prequels love em or hate em are there just add some more lore and background to the galaxy 🌌 at large and how there was always a much bigger game at play. But with this movie not one of them gives me a hint of what's going on in the galaxy at large, why did the new republics stop pursuing ex imperials, why weren't they prepared for another potential conflict if it arises, why are they so incompetent and why should I root for them defeat the First Order, and now the final Order speaking of which I could get a grasp that they just wanna return the empire to its former glory but these villains are a far cry from the original even the droid army was more intimidating then these guys because at least they didn't fall for some dumb yo mama prank calls. In fact the more I think about the film it could plot holes The Movie 🍿 as just thinking 🤔 about it makes less and less sense. Writing-wise the only good thing about is that the new main characters are finally all together going in adventures and even have a few decent and well-acted scenes together (when they're not being told to read forced marvel humor). Even then it was still too little too late as their dynamic should have been built upon throughout the Trilogy and had nowhere near the camaraderie of Han, Luke, and Leia.
On a technical level it is stunning to look at. The VFX and practical effects are something to be appreciated and kudos to the make and prosthetics department for all the neat looking alien 👽 designs. But for a film 🎞 of this magnitude this should be an automatic given with its more than $250million budget back by the biggest film studio in Hollywood and has the best artist-designers and VFX technology in the business at the click of a button or phone ☎️ call away. Too bad it couldn't save the dodgy editing poor choice of shots and clumsily choreographed lightsaber duels as its ether Medium close-ups or extreme wide an awkward balance of either to close or too far (yes I'm making the bold statement that these are the worst duels in the history of the franchise). Being an Indie filmmaker watched several small budget projects and been on multiple film sets I've seen experience so much more being done with so much less all because they have an undying passion to tell the story they want to tell without having to abide by mainstream norms. Overall I know I'm gonna have quite the debate with a few friends 👬 who for some reason loves these films, and I do wish I saw this with a bigger group of people to talk to right afterward, I did have a few good conversations with some strangers as I was walking 🚶out and I give Star Wars episode xi the Rise of Skywalker a 3/10"
I've never wanted to walk out of a movie more badly than this one. It literally goes back in time to ruin the other trilogies.
"So much better than the previous episode, JJ Abrams was always against it having to undo the mess made by TLJ. He has done a good job and rectified a lot of the issues created previous. The film is enjoyable and brings a fitting end to the Skywalker saga and was really well done how they made use of the unused film of Carrie Fisher."
"Worse film by far, it destroy all the precuels and the originals"
Easily the WORST of the three new Star Wars movies (Episode 6-9). The other two were just as god awful.
What's to stop Palpatine from being cloned again?
The visuals are fantastic and the cast is amazing and it brought a fitting end to the Skywalker saga.
"This movie was just a picked up of Disney trying to please the fan with reference of the good old movies and an old predictable Disney movie. At almost every moment of the movie I could predict what was gonna appen. Also the logic was totaly gone, I am not a big fan of the Star Wars trilogy but even myself was asking questions about the Force and other Jedi and Sith things that I knew was just an shitty explantion for the movie to continue and to justify the actions."
"It was all over the place and it made no sense, a stain on the Star Wars saga"
"This is what happens when you do storytelling by committee and don't lay out clearly the overall story arc for the trilogy at the beginning and adhere to it. There are plenty of plot holes and headshaking moments to go around, from going to a planet to find a wayfinder and discovering a magical knife that will lead them to it completely by accident, to being in just the right spot on another planet when they discover the knife is also a locator for said wayfinder, to jumping in and out of hyperspace with reckless abandon (still remember Han Solo's advice to Luke: ""jumping through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy. It requires precise calculations...""), to the ridiculously stupid and unexplained rescue/resurrection of Palpatine after Return of the Jedi, to the forced kiss between Kylo and Rey, to Kylo's miraculous recovery after being thrown over a seemingly bottomless chasm, to yet another Death Star/Starkiller/planet exploder weapon, to yet another ridiculously simple flaw in said weapon, and so on.

I don't know how a group of adults (using that term loosely here) sat in a reading room for this and did not see the gaping holes in the plots and the complete disregard for suspension of disbelief, which is necessary for any movie to be compelling. I sat through this, painfully aware that I was sitting in a theater being forced crap that made no sense, and ultimately stared blankly at the screen to watch the moving pixels only because I made the commitment to finish this sad trilogy. If the characters turned and stared at the camera for laughs it would not have been any less disrupting to my suspension of disbelief than the poor storytelling and flashing and noise at the end.

On a positive note, this is at least mildly more entertaining than The Last Jedi, due to Abrams' better treatment of humor, and better story pacing. To be fair, a lot of stuff happens during this 2.5 hour film, but it's always better when things happen for a reason, and so much of this movie happens for no real reason, other than to sell toys or compensate for the damage done by TLJ. As visually stunning as it is, the movie is just a horrible example of storytelling, and ultimately I walked away from this trilogy in the Star Wars franchise painfully aware that it IS a franchise, and that none of the new characters are especially likeable, not even Rey, who rightfully earned the title of Mary Sue due to her inexplicable ability to master Jedi skills that took Luke Skywalker years and much effort to develop...all because of her blood line. Rey, Poe, and Finn are all very shallow, forgettable characters who emote, but don't convey real struggle or desire and achieve greatness almost by entitlement. Poe magically maneuvers spaceships impossibly fast around targets and never misses, Rey goes from picking up Luke's light saber to being a saber fighting master over what? A few months? She never changes her outfit once throughout the whole trilogy! And Finn? He occasionally shoots and blows up a TIE fighter and shouts ""whoa!"" when he does, and through luck manages to avoid his own death at least a few times. As I said, completely shallow and forgettable characters.

So glad this is over, like one feels after watching a loved one suffer a long illness--sad, but relieved."
"I think this movie was ok, but not more than that. Maybe my expectations were too high as I expected an original ending of the saga, but it just felt as if the conclusion of ep. VI meant nothing and was just repeated in this movie. The movie looked great, great action scenes and visual and sound effects, but did not live up to the expectations made in the two previous installments. I hope they will make a series of movies about the old republic that will show us more about the origin of the force, the Jedi and the Sith."
Much better than The Last Jedi.  Still could have been better.
"In an overly complicated and unfortunate story arch, there are moments to celebrate that have the adventurous spirit of Star Wars. However, primarily the villain plot point is a mass disservice to all the previous saga episodes. The conclusion of this movie dissipates the conclusion of the original trilogy, and unfortunately, ruins said outcome. The themes, visuals, score, etc are spot on, but the actual plot is a horrid mark on the amazing sage as a whole. The previous episode left us with so much promise of a bright, expansive future for Star Wars: while this depressed that notion. It is convoluted and ridiculous enough to pull one away from the story while watching, and question if they are watching Star Wars or an excessive parody?"
"So disjointed and everywhere! The pacing is breakneck, and for good reason too, because if it was a little slower you'd have to time to think about how ridiculous everything that's happening is!
Such a shame they didn't plan out the production of these movies better. This was a failure of leadership and planning."
A film that puts fan pleasing higher than quality. Nobody wanted chewie to get that goddamn medal 30 years later!
"complete and utter nonsense, shouldnt even be considered cannon."
"It's not trash but it's definitely the worst movie of the trilogy. It's disappointing because the first two movies were good even if they hadn't so much connection between them, and this last one could do a good job and make the other ones have meaning, but it just looks like a solo movie. Moreover, even if you analyze it as a solo movie, it's not a good movie, a Star Wars fan may have felt shame with this movie, but I think it's not a waste of time for those who watched the 2 previous movies."
"I really enjoyed the movie and how it kept you on a ride, like while I was watching I thought the movie was going to go one way and went in a different but also really good moving way. Obviously this is just my opinion you should watch it for yourself and see what you think!"
Absolute garbage. The laziest cash grab. Fitting end to the recycled nonsense we have been subjected to again and again.
"The Rise of Skywalker did his best to redo the plot of The Return of the Jedi, which gave an unoriginal, boring and inconsistent (with the rest of the trilogy) movie.  At the end of this movie, we find the galaxy in the exact same state it was after Episode VI, and we reached this point by breaking a lot established lore along the way.  How ironic that a movie about a limitless universe had to be given a plot so repetitive and predictable."
Great music by John Williams.
"I barely understood the plot, uninteresting, jumbled, and draws too much on what came before."
"I didn't like it when I saw it in theaters, but had a much bigger revelation when it came out on Disney+ and my friend and I watched it again. Like the Prequels or The Room we like watching bad movies to make fun of them, but to my absolute amazement it wasn't even fun to laugh at. It was so incredibly boring that I just found myself dosing off with nothing to say. The only fun we had was yelling ""REY!!!"" every time Finn did. The whole thing is just so empty. I remember watching TLJ and hating the part where Luke drinks the milk. I remember just like ""ew, gross"" but now I'm like ""At least that scene makes me FEEL SOMETHING"" TROS makes me feel nothing. It's such an empty shell of a movie that I might as well be a toddler staring at a spinning mobile and some flashing lights.

And why does everyone keep blaming JJ but never bring up Chris Terrio? Why did anyone think that bringing the writer of Batman v Superman and Justice League would somehow be a good idea?"
"What a sour way to end the sequel trilogy. From the start of this film, it should be glaringly obvious to the viewer that there was no conversation as to how the sequels should be laid out before they were made. Each installation was the respective creatives winging it with minimal effort to even reference the story that had come before it. The Rise of Skywalker is the peak of this trend, as the film itself seems to be a desperate search for some kind of conclusive end to the sequel trilogy and Star Wars as a whole. But given how lack luster, ham fisted and tone deaf this grand finale was from start to end, for me at least, the saga ends on Endor."
"A rushed thoughtless end to what was the most disappointing trilogy in Star Wars history. Riddled with plot holes, untied story arcs and ridiculous mcguffins. It did one great thing, united those who loved the prequels with those who didn't, in confirming which trilogy was the worst."
The film fine. It was beautifully made and the actors did a pretty good job but the story never drew me in and it was quite confusing especially after watching The Last Jedi. I enjoyed it but would not want to watch it again
"The movie was actual trash 

I hate all the new Star Wars movies that Disney makes 
Rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting"
They couldn't defeat palpatine on the previous movies because they only used one lightsaber. The trick was using two.
"Despite the good acting the writing was the opposite. Not only did they reverse all the feats of the original trilogy characters, but it also proved useless and nonsensical to the rest of the subpar sequel trilogy. The editing of the movie gave it a ridiculously fast pace. The entire movie attempts to catch up for lost time from TLJ. A lot of time is spent reversing a lot of the strange decisions made in TLJ too, which could have been a refreshing change for the sequel trilogy-- but the change was pulled off so lazily. The reinsertion of Palpatine was just a bad decision on the writing team's part. It makes little to no sense in the pre-sequel canon. Overall the sequel trilogy proves to be completely detached from the rest of the Skywalker story line, and this final nail in the coffin just solidified my disdain for the trilogy. Music is great, and the saber duel is pretty good. Many plot holes too."
"What a waste. All the potential to take the story and finish it in a meaningful way was destroyed by apathetic writing, bizarre narrative choices that flew over the head of most movie watchers and annoyed die-hard lore fans, and the inability to create anything of substance or joy."
The audience score of 86% is not accurate for how many people have rated this movie terribly. Its also been at 86% for months now with no change despite thousands of new reviews coming in. RT locked their score for some reason. This movie is terrible and Disney should be ashamed of the sequel trilogy as a whole
An insult to the fans.
"Not only is this movie objectively bad, but it actively undermines the story told by the original trilogy."
"The amazing and epic finale of the Skywalker Star Wars saga! Disney put together a great film that pleases fans of Star Wars and the general public alike! While not as critically or deep like The Last Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. The Rise of Skywalker truly captured the Star Wars spirit and you can tell by how much of a fan JJ Abrams is for the Star Wars universe! Daisy Ridley's journey as Rey finally gets the well deserved ending she struggled for throughout the films. Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren again was one of the best on screen and without any words can sell his character's performance. C-3PO having a larger role was great too and the new alien characters were fantastic! Lando's return was amazing. Mark Hamill killed it as a force ghost and the use of Carrie Fisher was bittersweet as the final chance we will see Princess Leia again. John Boyega as Finn is a bit underdeveloped, but still glad to see. The ending is as epic and reminiscent of the celebration at the end of the Return of the Jedi. Rey's final scene was truly earned and I am so glad of her new name that she worked so hard for!"
"Well, I'm finally writing a review, because I didn't care to see Rise of Skywalker in theaters. Anything that followed the storyline of The Last Jedi was going to be garbage anyway, but aside from that, RoS suffers from lack of continuity to the previous trilogies. Like TLJ, there are so many things that happen in RoS where it's like ""Well why didn't this character do that move in ""Episode whatever"" to avoid this problem or defeat that enemy?"" And there are way too many coincidences as well. Getting into specifics would just take too long here. I'm not saying the Original Trilogy doesn't have flaws, and the Prequel Trilogy is loaded with cringey moments (but can largely be fixed with good editing), but at least the PT maintained decent continuity and honored the OT. The entire Sequel Trilogy was a jumbled up mess of rehashes, breaking continuity, and disgracing the original characters that made Star Wars so popular in the first place. And bringing the Emperor back to life? That's just bad, desperate writing. The one good thing about RoS is finally seeing some interaction between Rey, Finn, and Poe all together. But it's far too late for it to mean anything now. That really should have begun in The Force Awakens. TFA started off okay (despite doing the A New Hope storyline rip-off), but as soon as they broke continuity by having Rey go from nothing to a super force goddess in the space of a couple days in TFA, I knew the ST was in serious trouble. And then TLJ was far worse than anything I could have imagined. RoS wasn't as bad as TLJ, but it was pathetic and sad to watch. Nothing against the actors or production crew, but the writing of the entire ST is garbage. I guess they were in a rush to try and make money fast rather than give more polishing to pre-production to create something truly great, make tons more money off of it, and have fans be excited for more. Now Star Wars is nothing to get excited about, well, the new Star Wars anyway. It's the biggest cinematic failure in history. But the old Star Wars is still wonderful after 40 years! But Disney is so rich, they probably don't care."
"The Rise of Skywalker was a mindless cash grab, going against not only The Last Jedi but against the whole of the Saga previously. Multiple continuity and lore errors, a nonsensical plot and an ending that did not spark any genuine emotion. Just a representation of the lifeless corpse that is the Sequel Trilogy"
"FIVE STAR EXCELLENT !!! 
A film which should unite the fans base after the last film split it in two , a fast paced film which brings a touching sense of nostalgia  to the true  star wars fans . The Best Film in the trilogy for sure."
"I finally bit the bullet and watched it on Disney+. It was so much worse than I feared and my expectations were already low. Quite possibly this is the most creatively barren film ever to appear on movie screens in wide release. It is one thing to play it safe with the most expensive film franchise acquisition in the history of cinema, but it is quite another to wilfully reduce it to a theme park ride without even attempting to fool the audience into believing that they are actually witnessing a story unfolding on a screen"
"Another embarrassment. The Last Jedi was worse, but my hopes for the trilogy to be redeemed by this movie was crushed. Terrible movie."
I couldn't keep up. watching it was like sitting in a 3 hour classroom of flat earth. heart breaking.
Too interested in appeasing the worst critics of The Last Jedi - not at all interested in good storytelling.
Really missed the mark for what it could've been. So many missed opportunities for them to wrap up the saga in a satisfying manner and leave minimal plot points without conclusions.
"One of the best STARWARS movies!
I really enjoyed it"
Didnt represent the jedi order didnt represent luke sky walker the way he should have been the whole 3 movies were a disaster force awakens was good left off well then the last jedi and it went straight to the bottom very disappointed
"Wow, frankly I don't know what to say, when I went to the cinema to see The Rise of Skywalker on December 21st I was excited, I had appreciated the first two films of the sequel trilogy and I expected not to be disappointed, but I already had doubts about how they would made to bring Palpatine back into the saga, after he had died by falling into the Death Star reactor which had subsequently exploded, this to emphasize that he had died disintegrated. The film begins with the phrase ‘the dead speak', and this statement combined with the phrase that says Palpatine ""the dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" is the only explanation for the return of the emperor. This is the first plot hole, but it's a huge plot hole. In the first 6 minutes the film has already shown us three settings united by an insufficient montage but made with the help of excellent visual effects. The film goes too fast, 2h 20m, of which 8 minutes of credits, are not enough for the Skywalker Saga finale. Going forward we discover that Leia is training Rey, in the meantime the Resistance has the confirmation that Palpatine has returned, now I have a question: why did Palpatine announce his return? Wouldn't a surprise attack with his new fleet have been smarter? Previously Kylo had joined Palpatine who had proposed to give him his fleet in exchange for Rey's death. Another question arises, why does Kylo accept? The First Order already has a very powerful fleet, in that situation he could not have accepted and killed Palpatine. After various events Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO reach Pasaana, here we are introduced to a new jedi power, the ability to heal wounds through the Force, this is another plot hole, where Rey learned to use this power? We don't know. At this point the editing of the film finally becomes acceptable, in the previous chase scene on Pasaana he had hit rock bottom. At this point the movie cannot make a choice: Chewbacca dies, but it turns out that he is not dead; Zorii (a new character) first wants to kill Poe and five minutes later asks him to run away with her and when he refuses she gives him the most important thing that has, a pass for the First Order landing areas; finally the C-3PO memory is erased, but then R2-D2 reinstalls it. At this point Rey meets Kylo Ren who tells her that she is Palpatine's grandson, this is fan service, the writers took a random fan theory and chose it, Rey was made Palpatine's grandson to destroy the work of Rian Johnson who had made her the daughter of anyone important, a choice that I had appreciated. Speaking of destroying Rian Johnson's work, do you know why Palpatine returned? Because Snoke died and therefore Kylo Ren could not be made the main villain. Among other things, at the beginning of the film we discover that Palpatine created Snoke as he did is not explained to us. At this point the film improves, there is a good duel between Kylo and Rey, a father and son scene between Han Solo and Kylo, ​​and the long-awaited final battle. However before we get to the final confrontation we have a scene between Rey and Luke in which Luke reveals to Rey that he and Leia had always known that she was a Palpatine, why didn't they tell her before? Afterwards we fight on Exegol, here we have to thank John Williams and his always wonderful soundtracks and Visual Effects, as they make the ending more epic than it really is. At this point we find out that Palpatine had no precise plan, first he told Kylo to kill Rey, then when Rey comes to him, Palpatine changes his mind and asks Rey to kill him in order to become the new sith empress, finally when Rey refuses and Ben comes to help her, Palpatine discovers that he can absorb the vital energy from the two and uses it to come back to life and attack the Resistance fleet with lightning (since when can it be done?). In the end Rey manages to kill Palpatine with the help of all the other Jedi and I appreciate this. The film then ends on Tatooine where Rey buries the swords of Luke and Leia and assumes the surname of Skywalker, to many this thing has bothered me not, or at least not particularly, in the final however in addition to the Force ghosts of Luke and Leia I would have liked to have seen those of Anakin and Ben too. The truth is that in this film Palpatine should never have come back, not only because he was dead but also because he would have canceled the sacrifice of Anakin. In this film the main villain should have been Kylo Ren."
"it was pretty good. VERY rushed. it was hard to follow along because of all the questions and more the previous 2 had created and was kind of fan service. still it was better than the Last Jedi. but I think anything is really better than the Last Jedi. I don't think it quite lived up to be the epic finale It was made up to be, the visuals were good and there were some good parts but either than that pretty okay."
"Trashy from start to finish, terrible choices that undo any good that was set up before, like beating a dead horse. Way too busy, and really just uninspired fan-service."
It's good - I'd recommended it.
Who thought it was a good idea to bring Palpatine back?
THIS IS NOT STAR WARS!!! THIS IS CORPORATE DISNEY TRYING TO MAKE PROFIT AND TURN A BELOVED LEGACY INTO MCU MERCHANDISE!!! THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST AND ERASES EVERYTHING THAT STAR WARS LORE WAS!!!!
"(spoilers) At first, I did like this movie. However, the more I think about it the more disappointed I am. This is kind of an entertaining film, it's a bit rushed but that doesn't bother me too much. The problem here is the writing. Everything that has been done in the first 6 movies is erased. Palpatine's return makes Anakin/Vader's redemption arc pointless. Also Luke Skywalker's efforts to put an end to the empire is now pointless just so some new disney character can get some credit, which pushes me to dislike Rey more and more.. Force healing, Rey and Ben use force healing in some rather major ways, which removes any sense of danger from Star Wars and also pokes quite a few holes in 1-6. Why didn't Obi Wan use healing to save his master? Why didn't Anakin use healing to save Padme? Why didn't Luke use healing to save vader? The list goes on... Now, apart from the major plot holes created, let's talk about characters. Same as the last jedi, Finn is now useless and serves no purpose to the story, he's just there to scream ""RRREEEEEYYYYY!!!!"" Poe does get some development here, but his character is still somewhat forgettable. Rey is still dull and boring, unnecessarily powerful and not relatable. However Kylo Ren/Ben is actually cool in this movie, and is now as powerful as he should have been in the first place. (apart from that force pulling ship and healing, that was dumb). This movie does do a little for Luke, Leia, Han, and Lando. The only reason I would somewhat like this movie is Kylo/Ben and everything else is just bad."
Absoulute trash. At every cross road they came across when it came to resolving plotlines they decided to avoid the road at all and throw themselves of a cliff. The whole movie not only goes lightspeed plotwise but I could swear at dome points it felt like they literally sped it up. The whole thing could have been less awful if at least they did the ending right instead of having a 2 second bossfight and an incestuos kissing scene between characters that no one wanted together.
"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan. With the struggle between the Force Awakens and Last Jedi, this movie ended up being, ""Meh."" Palpatine returning was a high note, but he never reached his potential. Certain points in the movie had us cheering and yelling, ""No!"" But, they were few and far between. Seeing Billy Dee Williams come back was a delight (albeit brief). Kylo Ren's arc had its best moments at the end, making us wish for more. Rey's arc fell flat. All-in-all, they could have done better. Clone Wars and the Mandalorian gave us much better endings."
What a piece of garbage. This was somehow worse than Last Jedi.
"Certainly the best of the three. Not great not terrible. It's more fan focused this time. Which is fair. Give the people what they want. Its rushed. Very rushed. I cant get everything. There was nothing that made me really angry here at least. But it's nowhere near the original trilogy. Or even the other starwars media such as the Clone wars TV show ect. Music is fantastic as always.

Its meh."
"It's a good state wars movie...
It's definitely unlike anything we come to expect 
I recommend watching it with an unbiased broad view towards Disney star wars instead of comparing kit to previous installments"
A quite unsatisfying end to a giant inconsistent mess of a trilogy...
Considering the crap of TLJ and the vacuous A New Hope copy that was TFA - I kind of loved it. Ridiculous stuff at the end though and ridiculous closer.
"C'est une mauvaise suite a l'épisode 8 et même a l'épisode 7 et une mauvaise conclusion a la trilogie et la saga. Le film est plein d'incohérences, tout le potentiel qu'il avait est gâché. Le film est bâclé et n'a répondu a aucune de mes attentes. Cela dit, c'est un plutôt bon divertissement. Pour finir, je décrirais ce film comme un ramassis bâclé de fan-fiction ridicule"
Rise of Skywalker ruins previously established Star Wars Canon. The idea of Force Healing ruins the whole plot of the prequels. Bringing Palpatine back was a weak idea and it yet again proves that JJ Abrams can't come up with an original idea.
"Disney ruined this franchise, they used bringing back the emperor as another way to get fans in the theater and grab cash quick. JJ just read the Star Wars legend books and threw it in the rise of skywalker."
"It was ok when watching it in theaters, but when rewatching it, I realized it's pretty boring and the plot sucks.

A lot.

also they brought back Palpatine, ruining the 1000-year-old prophecy of the Chosen One"
The somewhat entertaining tragedy of poor writing and bad choices.
That was the biggest puddle of dog diarrhea I've ever seen. I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and crap out a better story than that garbage.
Horrible horrible horrible movie and especially acting
"What a mess. All the potential, three movies, and only one that’s coherent. This one is better than the second in this trilogy, but that’s faint praise. Just more ridiculous things slapped together and no sympathetic characters so no earned emotions. I felt much more emotion watching “LEGO: Batman” than through this entire trilogy."
"Nice story elements, but there was absolutely zero flow to the film. Everytime I got interested in the plot, there was an abrupt scene change.

This like the movie was directed by a squirrel."
C-3PO and Babu Frik are the best parts of this movie.
"Movie is entertaining but It's a lot of bullshit made up on the spot acting like it was planned from the start but really wasn't. A lot of people give this movie a pass because it was trying to ""fix"" the last jedi and a lot of people actually like this movie because it ""fixed"" the last jedi and/or ripped on it but I think this movie and this trilogy could've been great if they didn't try to please everyone, had a plan from the start, and actually owned up to what they made instead of making a movie to ""fix"" the last jedi and in the process rip on it at the same time. best way to describe this movie is a dumpster fire. Whenever I think of this movie and the sequels as a whole, I just get disappointed and sad."
Rubbish - yet still better than the last two.
"More plot holes than ships that magically appear at the end of the movie. 

Absolutely garbage fan service from start to finish. Giva meesa Jar Jar over this."
"The movie has some plot holes. However, the emotional impact and the overall entertainment value makes your forget about it as you watch. It's an epic adventure and conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. I will miss these characters greatly."
"This movie sucked first of all the diologue was terrible it made it sound like a mix between a Disney show like Austin and ally, and an SNL comedy special. Disney is trying to remake the hype the original trilogy got, by remaking Han Solo as Poe Damon, and kilo ren as darth vader, and Rey as Luke.  In addition the most famous droids in the Galaxy both R2 and C3PO had little to no showtime and hardly a place. To add to this they remade the feud darth maul and Obi Wan had as the feud luke and kilo had. In addition they add in all these stupid little character that have no real importance to the story line (Rose, Finn). In conclusion this show sucked."
A poorly paced movie of story vomit that I am just hoping will become legends so I can forget that it ever happened.
The Saga ended with Return of the Jedi
"Non è certo il migliore film al mondo,ma avendolo visto al cinema dopo avere sentito delle critiche completamente negative,mi aspettavo molto peggio...certo potevano evitare di spoilerare uno dei principali plotwist nei titoli di testa e studiarsela meglio, ma in generale mi ha dato le stesse vibrazioni degli altri Star Wars, qui di nulla di così negativo...devo pensare che come al solito la tendenza sia quella di rendere intoccabili i vecchi film e inondare di critiche tutto ciò che è stato fatto dopo? Anche qui dirò qualcosa di impopolare: ho visto qualche anno fa la trilogia originale e 2 film su tre hanno avuto un effetto soporifero su di me....però no,vietato parlare male della trilogia originale...no continuiamo a dire che Jar Jar binks è stupido, e invece i vari Ewoks e mostriciattoli della trilogia originale non lo sono. Ci sono delle scene alla Man in Black ,quindi dai, per favore....il film comunque ha delle parti molto belle.Per carità,vero che non è fatto benissimo, ma non è tutta sta negatività che cercano di farci passare.Mi sembra una conclusione accettabile. Punto."
"The lack of character development, plotholes, plotarmor and the luck of the main cast in every situation is just amazing. The good thing is: I won't look forward to new Star Wars content. What an utter disapointment."
I can't believe how bad the JJ Abrams Star Wars movies have been.  Thank God they are over.
"Yes the film is visually appealing, but the enjoyment stops there.  As a 90's kid I was brought up on the OT and experienced the PT in my youth; both were fantastic.  The story arcs were well thought out and the character development was shown really well in Lucas's Star Wars.  This film however just feels cheap, and comes across as a last ditch effort to finalize and make sense of the Disney trilogy.  Bringing Palpatine back..  His return to the franchise makes Darth Vader's sacrifice completely worthless, it undermines the entire arc of Anakin Skywalker being the chosen one and bringing balance to the force.  More force powers..  Disney forgets that when they introduce something 'new' that it affects everything past and present, some of the main issues found in the OT and PT could have been easily rectified using these force abilities that they've just made up. Disney had potential with the sequels, however after the huge mishandling of the TLJ which split the fan base, the TROS plays it safe with a bland quest like story and uninspiring ending to franchise.  For god's sake please leave KOTOR and the Old Republic alone"
Disney's commercialism ruined the end of the masterpiece series.
So much better than The last jedi! Feels like a true sequel to The force awakens.
"Great CGI, effects and actors. As a live long Star Wars fan I hated the story. The other movies of the franchise lost their meanings as Rey suddenly is the chosen one. 
[SPOILER]
- Palpatine died a really stupid death (Couldn't he just stop firing the lightnings?). 
- Why did Rey and Kylo Ren kiss at the end?
- That Rey is Palpatines grand daughter was really uncreative"
"Rise of Skywalker serves up heavy doses of fan service which ultimately fall flat because they lack the emotional resonance of the films they reference. The film jumps quickly from one jaw-dropping visual to the next, hoping the audience won't notice it is taking moments it has not earned--not logically, not emotionally. 

To cite just a couple of many possible examples: Rey's overcome of the villain? It didn't require a hero's journey to overcome a flaw, just a second lightsaber. Finn, Poe, and Rey embracing at the end? We must believe there is an intense bond there because there was witty banter in the first act and, hey, they look like they might be crying.

In the end, Rise of Skywalker is cotton candy--a powerful sensory stimulation, but not filling."
Great film! Made up for the last one and saves the trilogy!
Awful. A poor end to a struggling trilogy
"Ugh. That nearly sums up my reaction to this film. The only reason it gets a full star is because the 8th was worse. That is this movie's only saving grace. I know that a lot of the bad story, character development and premises can be tracked back to the previous shit show but that doesn't mean this movie didn't suck. It was a chore to watch. I literally just wanted to keep skipping ahead because I didn't care what was happening. It is not an engaging or entertaining movie. I won't rewatch even a minute of it on Youtube or while sitting down to marathon Star Wars. It is that bad. Save your money and/or time and rewatch the good Star Wars movies...UGH!"
"Spoiler Alert:


At the end of the movie, when rei kills palpatine, Jar Jar Binks should have come from the shadows behind the throne ""Yousa thought he was da sif lord, but noo, ita was meesa"" and proceed to butcher rei.  kylo, instead of getting out of the hole, slinks back down after seeing the horrific sight.  rebels lose, set up for next movie w/ Jar Jar Binks as main villian.  Ende"
Its flashy and fun to watch but by the end its too convoluted with plot holes. Too many things are vaguely unexplained or not at all. So many things feel un earned due to lazy writing.
"I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Rise of Skywalker handled Leah and her part in the saga despite Carrie Fisher  passing away over a year before principal photography began on the movie.  I am glad they built scenes around footage they had previously filmed of her in character and were able to complete her story that way.  The movie did seem to jump and fly at times too quickly and in a seemingly random way but after having seen it twice the movie did a very good job of tying up lose ends and carrying the observer through the entire saga to its conclusion.  

I did not like ""The last Jedi"" at first but after going back and watching it probably about 3 times my attitude has changed and I do like it.   I love the way Luke shows up towards the end to stand up (even if he was a type of telepathic holographic form) against the 1st Order and allow the Rebel Alliance to escape certain destruction at the hands of the Empire.  I loved the way Yoda showed up and worked  Luke through the problems he had with handling the Force and how his fears were probably the one thing most effective in holding him back from his potential.   The conflict and yet connection between Kylo and Rey was very interesting and I knew it would play a big part in the ""Rise of Skywalker"" as it did.

This is also what Luke had to convey to Rey as he appeared to her in ""Rise of Skywalker"" that she had to turn lose of her fears.  She had to realize that she was NOT alone.  Every Jedi that ever lived was alive in her now.  She had much more power and capability than she ever imagined.  She WAS up to the challenge.

If you like Star Wars as I do,   If you liked all of the first three and at least tolerated the prequil trilogy of Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Syth,  and if you had any appreciation at all for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi I believe you will appreciate this film.   It is not perfect but it does a GREAT job of wrapping things up.

One of my favorite things about this film is that they made a part for one of the greatest musical composer, conductors, and score writers in history John Williams in the movie.  There is a little shot of John Williams as a repair tech working on a set that included an artifact drawn from every film he has scored and that has been nominated for an academy award.  This included Jaws, Star Wars, Schindler's List, Home Alone, The Patriot, Fiddler on the Roof, Memoirs of a Geisha, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Saving Private Ryan,   It was a real treat to see him in the movie now as an Actor even though the above referenced music covers a period of over 60 years and his age is over 90 years old.

This movie gets two thumbs up from me.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to any Star Wars fan."
1st it must be said it was impossible to delivery a quality ending after TLJ. As expected ROS failed to close out the Skywalker trilogy in an enjoyable way after a promising start with TFA. This movie had potential but ultimately found itself catch in-between trying to walk back some of the more questionable decisions from episode 8 while at the same time advancing the current story. That level of ambition was far too much for a 2.5hr film. In the end it didn't do enough to retcon episode 8 and didn't leave enough screen time to tell a competent story. Which was the worst case scenario.
"The whole movie feels like it's riding off of past movie themes instead of creating something new. When it does attempt to create something new, it dumps the information into the movie without any past explanation of evidence of it existing before this movie. Even with that in mind, the movie still has amazing action sequences and effects that fill the movie with eye pleasing scenes."
"Watched it 3 times hoping that somehow, somewhere I would find some redeeming quality in this movie...but it doesn't exist.  This movie is terrible, but I guess it is a fitting end to the dumpster fire that was the trilogy headed by Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and J.J. Abrams - for that reason alone I give it a half star.  Otherwise, it deserves no star."
Decent movie considering it had to wipe out all the sh*t of the Last Jedi!
A visual and narrative trainwreck. This film was the feature-length cinematic equivalent of losing my religion.
"This movie ruins Star Wars. Luckily I can look past this trilogy and watch the original 6 films in peace; however, this film implements TRASH writing and GARBAGE storytelling to convey what seems like a 16 year old's fan fiction brought to life with millions of Disney dollars. Palpatine's return after Ep 6 fundamentally destroys nearly 30 years of Star Wars character development and story. To enjoy this movie is a SIN

My Rating: Bad"
The overall result is nothing but pure fan service crap.
"JJ Abrams returns to conclude the entire Skywalker Saga. And it went... not good.
First, let's get the positives away. Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker looks really beautiful. The VFX's are amazing.
And the score. The score is also amazing. But what would you expect with John Williams.
And then nothing else makes sense. Sure there is some good moments thrown in here and there, but there are not many of them. 
And don't make me start on Palpatine..."
"This movie is an embarrassment to the franchise. What made the original trilogy great is it's excellent story, originality, progression and character development, all that this movie lacks. Characters are constantly thrown in and the audience is told to believe a relationship exists and nothing from the plot is original, living in the shadows of the original trilogy. We constantly jump from planet to planet, from scene to scene practically giving me whiplash in my first viewing."
I'm upset I even tried
"Does the J.J. Abrams helmed space opera hold up emotionally? Yes. Does it hold up logically? No. This is why it isn't exactly the film for a loyal Star Wars fan. Nevertheless, one must acknowledge the excellent visual effects contributing to a generally enjoyable viewing for the average/casual onlooker."
Rian gave JJ nothing to work with so this was all retcon to try to bring back the fans Johnson alienated.  Didn't work.
Don't care what others say I frickin love this movie.
Anti climax to the new trilogy with many unanswered questions on the story and characters. tried watching again last week and found myself watching you tube videos halfway through. Just not worth watching full stop
"Wow this was bad... it wasn’t even “so bad it’s funny”, it was just boring"
The worst Star Wars film. Doesn't even feel like a franchise movie.
"If you are looking for a movie with little substance or weight, cheap fan-service moments and dialogue overflowing with exposition, then you'll likely love The Rise of Skywalker.

The ROS blatantly retcons and undermines the message of The Last Jedi. Instead of continuing the narrative set before it, the movie spends most of its time attempting to make a group of angry fans who would rather relive old moments happy, than explore the endless possibilities of Star Wars stories.

While visually stunning with moments that are fun and enjoyable, the movie is mostly forgettable. The face-paced nature of the movie has you jumping from one place to the next while using expositional narrative to carry its story.

The character arcs also created by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are almost completely undone. For example, Finn no longer cares about the rebellion but his concern is again, only on Rey and the possibilities of his story as an ex-stormtrooper are wasted. Similar things can be said for Rey and Po and characters of significant importance, like Rose, are sidelined for the sake of appeasing fans.

This movie had the potential to be a movie that could have been a groundbreaking conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Instead, J.J. Abrams plays it safe and misses the opportunity. Ultimately, that is why this film will fade from memory and will be overlooked by many in the future."
Thank you for ruining the Star Wars trilogy
"From a technical point of view, it's an amazing action packed movie; with intense sounds to great visuals. That's all that's going for it...

Really, it's a difficult and messy story that doesn't explain much, and concludes on probably the most dreary of notes, thus resolving - well - not a whole lot. There are more questions than answers, making this probably the most disappointing of this new trilogy."
"They tried so hard to make it good, and yet it doesn't show, it was predictible and ridiculous at some parts, the only thing i can't define yet is if this was worst than the last jedi"
"Horrific plot. 

Zero work was done on creating any meaningful character development. By the end of the movie, there was no reason to be attached to the characters, and so the producers seemed to choose instead to amp up the XTREME Xcitement to eleven by making MORE SHIPS with BIGGER GUNS and BIGGER LIGHTNING and BIGGER LASERS than EVER BEFORE, rather than by creating any sort of character we cared about.

Additionally, the plot was painfully contrived, deeply inconsistent, and woefully pointless.

This movie is loud and meaningless.

Shame on you, Kennedy. You somehow made a worse piece of garbage than either of the two preceding dumpster fires."
"86% 
uf people, did you watch the same movie that I watched?
Crap crap crap."
"I'll first say, to Abram's credit, the prelude reveal in the title scroll illustrates exactly what you're in for, lighting the exit sign for every fan and casual movie goer.

Incoherent action sequences and blaring fan service are the least of this movie's  problems, with rampant ex machina being some of its most egregious.

It simply doesn't bother to tell a story. It is supplemented content to tie up pesky plots and subplots, patch together diverging narratives, and retrofit a dramatic conclusion. I won't start in on the unsolicited MacGuffins that serve as plot linchpins. 

The Rise of Skywalker is a masterclass in unnatural dialogue, poorly developed characters, shameless plot devices, and flawed structure. Every film and screenwriting student has something to learn here, and for that reason and that reason alone this movie justifies it's existence."
"Was a movie of contradiction. Was not a great ending to the saga. The movie felt rushed. The ending to the movie was okay. I wish Chewy or C3PO actually died instead of magically surviving. Also they shouldn't have made the Tie Fighters into triangles that made no sense. Also the jokes weren't that good. Also, did the JJ Abrams lose his memory and forget what Finn was going to tell Rey. In the end it just didn't up making a good movie."
"I went into it hearing all the bad reviews...and i think the worst part is...i will probably forget most of this movie in the next day or two.

I remember the prequels because there was something to remember but...this one? nothing. at all. it was...sorely lacking. in many ways. the end is unsatisfying, the deaths in the movie...the emotional payouts aren't there; it's just...a movie that seems to me to be there for the name only.

Now, the actors did good, won't deny that, but a good actor can only do so much with a script. There were things that were left hanging and...given my general overall detachment from this part of the Star Wars Saga...I won't be buying supplemental materials because...I don't care enough after watching all three movies and the ending to this one to actually find out the answers to my questions."
"Rian Johnson has made some great films, but the last Jedi sure isn't one of them. In an attempt to fix what Rian started, Abrams made some quick decisions and some strange and out of place plot choices to try and fix the problem. It didn't quite work. It wasn't his fault entirely, I blame Disney, and Rian for a wasted finale to the beloved franchise. Disney should have left Abrams to continue his world building and stayed with the director that was so successful at the force awakens. Rian Johnson just wasn't the right director for the job with the outlandish choices he made in the last Jedi and as unfortunate as it is, Abrams's rebound from that didn't work."
I hate TLJ with a passion. Glad JJ was able to fix the mess Rian left behind.
"The sequel trilogy will go down as a prime example of the importance of building a road map when you plan on having multiple movies tell a single story.  It's painfully obvious that they did not have one, which makes for a somewhat frustrating finale.  Still, The Rise of Skywalker manages to deliver an enjoyable, action-packed adventure that gives closure to this roller-coaster of a trilogy."
"There was so much crammed into this that an unrelenting series of increasingly incredible coincidences were necessary to link things together and make the plot work; never a good sign. Everyone just happens to find everything they need instantly, exactly the right people randomly appear for no apparent reason at exactly the right time, etc. It actually had me laughing at how silly it all was.
The action sequences were mostly fast and cartoonish in that there was so much destruction but few of the good guys even got hurt, whereas for the bad guys it was unrelenting carnage. Stormtroopers and First Order ships were just there to get shot and blown up, without ever accomplishing anything or even being a credible threat. The Emperor's force lightning, apparently now so amazing powerful that it can selectively target and cripple hundreds of good-guy ships scattered among the bad-guy ships, once turned off, had no lasting effect; it doesn't even fry their electronics; they just got shook up a bit. Despite some ships shown as being on fire, they all magically get better again as soon as his attack stops. Like I said, cartoonish. It was so silly. Consequently, it's hard to care about any of the characters. More like a computer game set to ""Easy"" mode than a movie."
Very satisfying completion of an amazing journey
No story or plot whatsoever and makes a mockery of the franchise while undoing the former characters successes with lazy cheap writing thrown in
"This is what happens when a Z move has money behind it   
Plenty of explosion but the worst dialogue I've ever heard"
"A strange movie throughout, which brought an unemotional mildly satisfying end to the Disney trilogy. Considering the horrendous setbacks of Episode 8, this movie was a decent attempt to cleanup the plot and wrap up the trilogy on the part of JJ Abrams. it had many setbacks, and many good visuals, but somehow failed to evoke any emotion either positive or negative, despite it being the (current) end to the Star Wars saga."
"Visually stunning and not as dreadful as The Last Jedi, the Rise of Skywalker is still disappointing in both writing and acting.  Innumerable flaws in continuity and plausibility along with very uneven dialogue left me lukewarm at best."
"omg that was a big pieace of shit, all the decisions of the characters were so annoying and stupid, they have huge budget to make a fucking great movie but what they decide to do? a piece of shit whit good efects"
"The short version: 
This film tried DESPERATELY to be what Avengers Endgame was. And it failed miserably. Lacking the consequences, heart and mystery that builds every star wars movie."
"A Force Awakens was a fun roller coaster that brought back a lot of what I loved about Star Wars, The Last Jedi then pushed the story forward in an interesting way and showed that anyone anywhere could be special without having to be born into it, unfortunately The Rise of Skywalker then backed down or reversed a lot of the interesting decisions Rian Johnson made and gives us a lot of fan service in the hopes of racking in LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY. It made a billion worldwide so I guess it succeeded. I disagree with a lot of the creative decisions in this movie including bringing back a clone of the Emperor who died in Return of the Jedi - JJ Abrahms is great at reboots but fails to push things forward or give us something new, which is why people had loved Star Wars and Empire to begin with."
"Best movie in the Skywalker Saga. Rey,Kylo, Palpatine unbelievable incredible performances from Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Ian McDermid. P.S beautiful use of Leia in this movie and Luke too. GO WATCH THE RISE OF SKYWALKER!"
This movie is unexciting but the comedic sense to it saves this movie.
"Whilst several parts of the film appear to go out of their way to destroy the original star wars characters, the second half acknowledges the existence of a better trilogy, and offers a sufficient conclusion with better music."
"Visually stunning, as all modern Stars Wars movies are (thanks Disney!), but there are far too many plot holes to ignore in this failed attempt of a movie."
An absolutely beautiful conclusion to the saga. Wow.
"Was disappointed in TLJ, but was pleasantly surprised by this film."
Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker is the most convoluted Star Wars film that failed to end as a conclusive chapter to the Skywalker Saga.
"Somehow it's even worse than when I saw it at the movie theater! Somehow they introduced like 50 new powers, palpating turned into the god of thunder, and the skywalkers took plapatines side over their own kid. Makes no sense"
"A confusing, non-sensical attempt to conclude a trilogy that was uninspired from the start. It's hard to even know where to begin. The pacing was insanely quick, to the point where they needed to speak exposition to progress the narrative, all of the remaining, previous accomplishments achieved by the PT and OT characters are undone (mostly courtesy of revisionist history). MacGuffin after MacGuffin, this movie is driven forward by the quest for random artifacts that feel bizarre in the Star Wars universe. Characters arcs aren't fleshed out, in fact they reduce the characters back to their basic form (except the Mary Sue who somehow becomes even more powerful than she was in the previous films).  I question how this film made it past the writer's room, because of how incoherent it is. But given the previous 2 films in the trilogy, it seems to be consistent in quality: Garbage."
"The best-paced installment of the ""Skywalker Saga"" is weighed down by unambitious and lackluster storytelling. The most ""creative"" twists come when a character appears dead, but in true Disney fashion, is still alive"
"From insane coincidences, to the flagrant recycling of plot points & characters, this cash grab nearly got me kicked out of an Alamo Theater for laughing too hard.  Amazing special effects, great camera work, mediocre acting all around, and writing worse than an ed edd & eddy episode. If you never knew what star wars was, and watched it on mute, you could enjoy it."
a great way to end this 40-year saga. May The Force Be With You.  Always.
"Rise of the Skywalker has quite a few issues but it also has a lot of good things about it. To see all of the characters fleshed out and finished with their story is heartwarming. It really encaptures the feel of the old Star Wars movies, with some satisfying character arcs. One thing the movie does is abandon all of the stories that have been layed out by the previous two movies to go off in a different direction and there are a few continuity errors. The first 30-40 minutes gave me whiplash but I do really recommend to see the Skywalker saga come to a close."
"Didn't hit the nostalgia button everyone talks about. Saw familiar characters.. oh boy, went no where. Just like the plot of almost any character. Redo of previous movies. No explanations of anything that came about. Ex., palapatine (how?) Rey 'Skywalker' (no?).. Random massive fleet (ok?).. Why did Liea die so suddenly?.. I could go on and on. In short: the visuals were awesome. The story and character development were beyond sub par. Decent movie if you're not a fan of star wars. Horrible if you are. Find a new director."
"There is a bunch of sloppy mistakes like continuity errors and weird edits that individually would not be worth commenting in a comedy but they are so numerous it not only ruins the movie but the whole saga if you consider this part of star wars.

Like a date with a boring supermodel, you get excited and it sounds like a good idea at first."
My absolute favorite Star Wars movie now! I can't stop watching it over and over. What a satisfying way to end a series.
Terrible. Practically a fan fiction written by an 8 year old
It was the worst possible way to end this saga
"Krustytheklownsmoking.gif 
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!"
This is an amazing conclusion to the Skywalker Saga!
"For almost the first two hours the show was very boring. The ending did breath some life into the film, but...."
"very shit, very very shit"
The first half wasn't bad at all. The second half is a train wreck and a wildly unfit conclusion (for now) to the Star Wars saga. This is poor writing and directing at its finest.
Loved it. Just need some better writing for Poe.
"LO MEJOR DE ESTA  TRILOGÍA FUE EL DESARROLLO DEL PERSONAJE DE ADAM DRIVER ¨KYLO REN AKA BEN SOLO¨. PORQUE EN EL DESARROLLO DE LA HISTORIA, SU FONDO Y SU FORMA, BROER. DEBE EXISTIR UNA CONSISTENCIA ENTRE UNA PELÍCULA Y LA OTRA, NO PUEDES DEJAR HISTORIAS INCONCLUSAS."
"I loved both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi (contentious I know!) and had been really looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy. The first two films seemed to have managed the transition from beloved legacy characters from the original saga and the new cast.  This final movie seemed well set up to focus on Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren etc and take the story in a completely new direction. 

For whatever reason (from what I have read it was a reaction to criticism directed from fans towards The Last Jedi) most of the ideas and themes set up in the Last Jedi are jettisoned in The Rise of Skywalker and instead of a progression this film regresses and gives us a Star Wars by numbers movie, rehashing old themes and forcing in old characters who do not really advance the plot and would probably have been better placed in one of the previous instalments (Lando) or not at all (Palpatine). Whilst The Force Awakens did basically follow the same structure as the original Star Wars films it managed to feel fresh;  the inclusion of beloved characters worked as their connection to new characters was well constructed, they advanced the plot, gave the film a huge amount emotional centre AND we had the promise of where the exciting new characters would take us. 

For me The Rise of Skywalker was completely inconsistent with the previous two films, did not conclude the story arcs of any of the new characters to anything like a satisfactory conclusion and rendered the conflict between Rey and Kylo that had been well developed across two previous films a limp side note rather placing it centre stage where (for me) it should have been. The reintroduction of Palpatine was a huge disappointment, made little sense and (again for me) ruined this film as well as tainting the conclusion of the original trilogy in Return of the Jedi. 

Concluding a series as big as this is clearly no easy task and this film seems to have suffered hugely as the filmmakers lost their nerve, backtracked on the groundwork set up in the previous instalment and instead produced a Star Wars by numbers film that left me cold."
"I am a huge Star Wars fan ... I know this did not keep in full line with the trilogy but don't care, i absolutely enjoyed this movie!!  Full Star Wars through and through, much better acting than the pre-quils (of course... what isn't?  Alf was better than those...).  5 stars, well deserved."
"With the bad taste of, the last jedi, still lingering. It took a little bit to get in to it but JJ Adam's did a great job fixing the mistakes and made the movie enjoyable, and restored star wars for me  . Seems like critics have no clue what people like."
"Entretenida, pero a mi parecer, la peor de esta trilogia.
No digo que es pesima, solo digo que las otras dos son mejores, un final que carece de epicidad, y personajes desperdiciados como Hux, y el mismo Snoke, no me gustó el hecho de que fuera un ""titere"" de Darth Sidius. Pudo ser mucho mejor, pero igual la disfruté. No hay pelicula de Star Wars que no me haya gustado."
"Took a franchise that had already ended well, opened it back up, and added more unnecessary content."
Expertly crafted finale to the original Star Wars story. Lacking the fun and charisma of the early installments to does a decent job of wrapping thing up.
"Horrible disappointment to allow Abrams to direct this saga.  I am really surprised that they didn't create a 3rd Death Star to blow up and instead opted to resurrect Palpatine out of the blue instead. 

If ending a meal with the worst possible dessert in the world to leave the taste of lifelong disappointment in your mouth is how you want to remember the evening, plug your nose and grab a spoon to gag on.

My only hope is that someone, some day who can tell a legitimate and coherent story will revisit the last couple of installments to do Stat Wars justice."
"Honestly, I felt bad for JJ.  He was effectively written into a corner by The Last Jedi.  When the main bad guy is killed off prior to the final act, it kind of makes it hard to worry about the good guys, especially when the main good guy (or girl) doesn't seem to have any possible chance of losing anyway.  It felt like mediocre fan fiction.  While I appreciate the effort to try and fix what happened in the prior film, it was too much shoved into a single film.  Maybe if JJ had two more films, he might have been able to make it work, but even then I doubt it."
"Film looks good and has some decent, if predicatable, set pieces. Talented people worked on these epics. However, it also has plot holes you can drive a star destroyer through and so many unanswered questions. Most importantly, I just don't care about what happens to the characters, even (and this is heretical) the original ones. Another franchise ruined in the pursuit of $$$ (a tear slides down my gradually aging face). Whatever happened to original storytelling and character development? Oh wait...that would mean taking some risks."
"JJ and Disney make a piece of banta shit:
Shitty script
Shitty characters 
Shitty camera

Good Lord, please make JJ never make new movie in any universe I love."
Mildly entertaining and that's about all.  for the end of a 9 part Superseries...incredibly disappointed!
"WOW! This is how Disney decided to end it? To say it was disappointing would be an understatement. To say it was a rotten, stinking pile of garbage gets closer."
"::Spoiler Alert::  The first 30 minutes or so are kind of fun but once this thing gets rolling, it falls apart quickly. I can get past the fact that a lot of the themes and even characters are recycled if it serves the story but nothing is explained. How did Palpatine survive? How does Ben / Kylo go from a destructive sociopath to all of a sudden being good again? Why would Rey's parents just leave her on a desert planet, with no one of importance / concern to care for her? Who is Palpatine's son? How did Palpatine get a son? What did Finn want to tell Rey that the movie made seem so important? Why did Finn and Rose break up? What is a force diad? What is the diforce? How are people sometimes revived but sometimes die permanently? So many more questions.. But if you like cool graphics, lasers and maybe have never seen any Star Wars pre Episode VII, you may get some enjoyment out of this. Unfortunately for someone who has invested over 30 years in this franchise, this is recycled garbage."
"Also can be called:

Star Wars: Damage Control
or
Star Wars: Things Just Conveniently Happen"
"This is the second worst Star Wars movie. Only episode 8 was worse. The story is terrible, the acting is mostly terrible, and the fight scenes are horrific. It's bad enough most of the characters are crappy knock offs of the original trilogy. It's amazing the with Disney money and already tons of great potential story lines the made this shit trilogy."
"TROS tries to fix last film's mistakes with a satisfying ending, but it is not enough to save this trilogy."
I seriously don't get why this was so poorly rated... Wayyyy better than Last Jedi
"Overall, the new Star Wars movies have been very good films, very bad Star Wars. 
Not this one. This was a terrible film, and downright offensive Star Wars. I did not have high expectations, but I did not think this was possible. I don't think any piece of entertainment media has ever pissed me off as much as this dumpster fire."
"Really enjoyed this movie. There were a few corny bits BUT: Healthy dose of action, drama, adventure, and sci-fi. The set pieces were great. The story was good. The acting wonderful and so human. The CGI was great. The star-fights were great. We really cared about the characters and their welfare. 

Solid movie definitely recommend."
"As a final installment in the Skywalker Saga, I think that this wrapped up the narrative very well. We followed our heroes the whole time and barely ever cut away from them. The film was fast-paced, lots of travel, lots of character development moments, and a kick-ass finale. I think that is the best ending to this Saga that we could've gotten, in my opinion."
"4 and a half. The Rise Of Skywalker is a mostly well constructed, cute, funny, emotional sci-fi ride. It has confusing moments, and the action isn't necessarily too mind blowing, like Last Jedi, but at towards the end, the final battle, is where the visuals are really striking and the action is wild. This movie is a bit easier to understand then other ones, too. I might love it. The action and visuals are still fun throughout the film though, with a Stormtrooper surprise......"
It was pretty good but I felt the Last Jedi was better. Rogue One is still one of the best of the newer films. The Force Awakens is the best among the new trilogy. Han Solo had some great moments. Now my wife loved the Rise of Skywalker. But for me it wasn't the best. I was hoping for better.
"Lots of fun to watch. Still not as good as the Force Awakens, but it wraps up the saga nicely."
Return of the Skywalker is a well crafted movie. Too bad the movie is nothing but a mash of fan service and is a knock off Return of the Jedi.  The characters don't make any sense and there's no continuity from the last film.  Truly disappointed.
"From a connected trilogy and universe standpoint, the movie reverts and takes an easy way out of a difficult situation. Appeasement is a terrible policy and one that ruins this movie. However, the film is still amazingly well made and beyond huge plot holes, still has some really amazing individual scenes."
"It's striking how the scores are contrasted in this movie. Themes I enjoyed - The Prodigal Son - Ben Solo/Han Solo; Hope is worth fighting for and dying for; Skywalker's are those who give their life for others. 

I gave 5* because I know Star Wars. If I hadn't seen some of the no -movie story line it would be hard to understand how the Emperor is still alive, etc. and would probably have given it 4* since the story would seem fragmented."
The script wouldn’t have passed an entry level writing class. Technical aspects were good.
The WORST movie from the entire saga for shure!!
"This film is amazing. I mean, there were problems here and there, the plot was a little bit hit-or-miss, but the characters, the music, the scenery! It was an immersive experience, that while significantly different to other Star Wars films, still gave you a semblance of the same feeling."
It could've been better and I would've given it a higher rating if Disney didn't cut Hayden Christensen scenes out of the movie. Overall it's a decent movie but it's a lot better than the last jedi. I wish Rey wasn't so powerful so fast while it takes other Jedi years to train. Those are my only complaints this movie is decent
"So boring, I just wished to fast forward, A STAR WARS MOVIE? Thats crazy, but true, so bad, just bad."
Same plot gimmicks as other Star Wars movies.
"Terrible, the visuals were there but it honestly didn't feel like star wars, the plot is all over the place and there was never a moment where it made sense, watch the clone wars instead it's better"
"Unfortunately Star Wars is dead in terms of movies folks. 
Whatever Star wars was is gone and whatever this is isn't worth your time."
"What a mess. The plot was just all over place, Force Skype/Teleport made even less sense and Rey was basically a god at this point. Also she killed Palpatine, so why didn't he possess her? Why didn't Palpatine take a suicide pill and then just hop into her body?? I don't even know if I can say it's better than Last Jedi 🤮.

Finally, how is this still at 86%??? I call shinanagans!!!"
Come on. Are they even trying anymore?
"On the back of the bullshit that was The Last Jedi this film starts off very fast paced and with not much meat on the bones. Clearly chasing down and rectifying the errors of its predecessor. 
Not a perfect film to start with but it was needed! Sadly..
When The Last Jedi holes have been plugged as much as can be the film finally starts to get some weight and really picks up! Really enjoyable film, not perfect. Still a few flaws but more in line with the Star Wars universe and gives the story we all wanted following on from The Force Awakens."
"The movie spits in the face of anyone who cared enough to delve deep into the books or comics and have good understanding of the force. Suddenly the new trilogy changed the force to be wizardry with no explanation, rules and limitations. I could forgive anything else, but that is destroying the main foundation of Star Wars.
Also the ""And I am Iron Man"" ending made me cringe."
Worst movie ever ! :(
"Terrible. Awful writing. Nothing but MacGuffins. Overacted (Adam Driver and Mark Hamill were the only non-cringey  actors). Full of plot holes. I still have no idea what this trilogy was about, it was that bad."
"A very messy film. Tons of plotholes and tons of things never even explained. Which in turn makes a lot of things they were trying to do feel unearned. With all of that being said I was still entertained all the way through, and a couple scenes were actually great to watch. Overall a forgetable below average film to waste the time."
"Tens of thousands of star destroyers magically raised from underneath the surface of a planet, complete with trained crew. Riding bothans in a charge against blaster fire on top of a star destroyer. Ren kissing Kylo. Why? Nothing makes sense here, it's just nice scenery and drama that no one cares about. Does anyone read these scripts at all? What are they paying Bigelow for?"
"The reason why I am giving Rise of Skywalker such a low rating is because it is so incredibly lack luster. This movie follows an extremely formulaic plot. It did not deliver a single challenging moment for the audience; everything it did was nicely wrapped up in a neat little package. The struggles that Rey faces as a character are a copy and paste version of Luke Skywalker's, except far far less convincing. This movie had opportunities to be innovative, but chose the easy path. 
The ending of a trilogy really needs something more than what we got here."
"I for one thought this movie was amazing, I thought it tied up the story very well, definitely a must see for fellow Star Wars fans. Now this is just my opinion, I know some people haven't cared for the past few ones (I loved those ones too) but I really thought it was a great movie, and I think any fellow Star Wars lover should at least see it once🙃. Definitely one of my favorite movies🙂!"
The Rise of Skywalker does have its moments of epicness. But some might say that the only satisfying part was that it ended.
"What a train wreck of an ending. What the devil is going on with this ""instant disappearing"" crap? It was lame in the previous movie and its lame here as well.

A good movie would've had some tragedy such as Rey dying and Ben Solo taking over...like its supposed to be! Noooo....instead we now have Rey ""Fake"" Skywalker. How lame and predictable. I could've slept through the whole movie and told you what happened at the end."
Star Wars Rise of Skywalker (2019) I think I like this film better than Force Awakens but I think that this film proves to me that it is an unnecessary trilogy because basically the ending of the film was resolved in Return of the Jedi and they just retold A New Hope- Return of the Jedi with different characters. I like the visual look of this film. I thought the idea that C-3P0 could not read Sith was dumb. I thought the fact that the Sith language is just Sith rather than another term was unoriginal and not convincing. I thought it was bogus that C-3P0 memory had to be wiped in order to be able to translate Sith. I did like having C-3P0 with a wiped memory but I did not like that that aspect was not played around very much. I was not convinced with the Emperor having a Hidden Imperial fleet with Star Destroyers with planet destroying devices attached onboard. I will admit that I did not feel as upset by this film as I was by Force Awakens or The Last Jedi. I felt like the new characters were cool but they did not have enough to work with to get me invested. I did thing the idea of Hyper space jumping was dumb. I was also not a fan of these new Force powers that are in the film like Ghost Luke Skywalker now able lift up an X-Wing out of the water. Emperor Palpatine able to electrocute a Rebel fleet in the sky by himself. That was bogus and unconvincing. I liked the world building but in some ways it felt smaller rather than bigger. I liked some of the new introduced vehicles in this film. This film did get me going really? A lot. Because they went in directions that are completely unnecessary and bigger does not always mean better. What got me was how many times Ray ditches her friends in this film. Does not even tell her friends where she is going. I thought the Leia scenes were done okay. I wish that we saw more of Ghost Luke and Lando in this film to help with the plot. We saw more of Leia that Lando Calrissian or Luke and that surprised me since the actors Billy Dee Williams & Mark Hamill are still alive so I would have thought that a bigger role would have been give to them. I thought that this film provided a proper resolution to Leia & Han Solo. I was glad that we did get one more scene with Han Solo to give that some resolution.
"After 5 underwhelming prequals and sequels, the writers finally write a GOOD Star Wars movie! I also mostly enjoyed the Rogue One moviewhich was truer to the original franchise than 1,2,3,7,8. IX Was by far the best Star Wars movie that has been made in the last 2 decades."
The ending was bad. There was no bromance at all!
Since this series had disappointed me I the past I  was very apprehensive. The movie was excellent with great special effects and storyline.
A great conclusion to the Skywalker story. My only complaint is that I had to wait over over 20 years for the ending of the story to be told. However it was worth the wait for it to be done right.
Force healing bad. Movie bad. Bad movie. Bad...
"Fitting ending, reincorporating favorite lines and moments, bringing many stories to a close."
"Bad, didn't like...."
"I gave it 4 stars cause its NOT The Last Jedi. I believe  they wasted an opportunity,  for instance, being someone who was there when Star Wars first came out in 1977, and it was just called Star Wars, not episode 4, the think that it attracted to me was the battles in space. They could have made the last battle spectacular.  But in the end it was just ... okay. But as far as the story, it was pretty good. Yes answer's were made, but new questions as well. I can give you a lot of flaws , a lot of what they did correct, but I believe the important question is, "" was the ending worth it?"" The answer is yes, definitely yes."
"Poorly made, terrible flow to the story...Absolute dogshit...."
"This movie made NO sense. Ironically, this movie is the opposite of Avengers: Endgame, both semi-finales to huge Disney franchises. While Avengers: Endgame was slow at times, it was so well done in terms of character development and action (at the end). However, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker is a clusterfuck. Somehow WORSE than The Last Jedi, the movie is filled with plot holes and rushed plot development (I already found 10 huge plot holes within the first 5 minutes). I would not recommend this film to anyone, except for if you want to make fun at a movie. What makes this film even worse is that the original director's script with concept art leaked and it looked amazing; possibly even the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy (which, btw, I am not a fanboy of the originals, but this movie is terrible)."
"So I liked more in the film that I didn't. However I have some feedback. 
Awesome parts - Luke grabbing the light sabre, Hans solo returning to speak to kylo. Palpatine repeating old famous lines from the other trilogies. Kylo rens kiss with ray. 
Negatives - I really felt that more could have been done, for example when ray heard all the Jedis voices, why not put them all around her as force ghosts. Each giving her more power, Anakin, obey etc all around her. That would have been awesome. I also felt that it was at some points spoon fed, the original films didn't need to spell it out for you to understand. Overall was much better than the other Disney films."
"I think the worst part about the Disney trilogy is how much potential they had. Like, the Ideas of a stormtrooper turned rebel, and Han Solo and Leia's son being a Sith are fascinating. But they just fucking ruined it by having a board room write the whole thing, and turning it into pure shit."
"No me voy a extender mucho. Si eres fan de StarWars ni la mires. Pobre guión y argumento y ni por asomo es una película de StarWars. Si eres fan y masoquista, plantéatelo como un mundo aparte, si no sufrirás un colapso."
"I will concede that this is not an easy film to make.  However, many of the decisions I felt were offensive.  Forcing new characters in that didn't matter, new Jedi powers, expanding old plots and you're just left with an empty, forgettable mess.  Like many of the remakes this too was a letdown."
"Wow, more Star Wars garbage! It is just a poorly recapitulated story of the original which was great! Acting was mediocre, the plot was tiresome, and I hope we have seen the end of Skywalkers.  Rey was a pitiful excuse for a Jedi, and Kylo-Ren was a lame Sith.  So far the only saving grace for Star Wars lately has been the Mandalorian installment. Don't let JJ Abrams or Rian Johnson touch that one or else it might be ruined also."
"It felt like they fed an AI the scripts of the last 8 movies and told it to churn something out that would please everybody. I really think there was a way to respect the decisions of the last movie while also creating something that more fans would have found satisfying and this movie definitely was not that. The leaked Trevrow script sounds like it would have definitely been a much more satisfying, even if flawed, conclusion to the Skywalker Saga then this trainwreck was. I was really disappointed but at least I have the other movies and tv shows to fall back on and remind me why I fell in love with this series in the first place"
"There is no words that can express how awful this movie was. The plot, the ways they used the force, the acting, the graphics, the battle scenes... Awful... Just pure awful. Everyone that participated in this movie should be ashamed and should have no right to make another movie."
"This movie can really only be described with one word: Garbage. I didn't think the sequels could get any worse, but somehow they managed it. Before ""Rise of the Skywalker"", I was sure the folks at Disney were just throwing random crap together, confident that the Star Wars brand would carry even the worst atrocities. But at this point I can only assume they're deliberately trying to destroy the Star Wars franchise for some reason."
This is painful to watch
Mediocre at best. The characters were shallow and the story is ridden with plot holes.
"Not to be mean or anything, BUT WHY DOES THIS HAVE A WORSE RATING THAN THE PHANTOM MENACE!!!!!"
"There no reason to hate the movie just because it might be the last movie, you gotta like it or hated at the same time"
I liked last two minutes of it. To bad the rest of it was just bad :(
"I've just seen the movie as I was staying away from star wars since ""The Last Jedi"". I agree the first 20-30 minutes are pretty jammed with plot and I'm glad to tell you the rest is nearly a masterpiece... I wish they had a little more cash and time to polish every scene to its fullest! That being said this movie made some really bold choices and is seriously respecting everything that came before it, even ""The last Jedi""! Best one of the three! Gotta see it again with another boycotter... Thank you J.J. for a very good Star Wars movie...."
"There was a lot riding on this last instalment. The story was crammed and nonsensical, the script was meh, but most importantly there are several points in this movie where some characters should just stay dead. Far too much resurrecting."
"Absolutely terrible jumble mess of a movie. With some good moments, but overall just not good at all. Starts like a hot mess and ends with one of the craziest roller coaster of emotions that make you think they had no idea how to finish this movie. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth even with all the camels in it. Ugh."
"A very disappointing, unsatisfying end to the Skywalker Saga"
"Despite a stronger story than its predecessor, still a disappointing entry into the Star Wars legacy."
"Better than the Last Jedi, but too much was crammed in (too little too late) - no real character development and farcical repetition.  Great action scenes but its all been done before better in Ep1, 2 and 3."
"I'm in two minds about this movie , the first being I'm not a child anymore so maybe this isn't aimed at an adult audience and also you will never be able to better a new hope or the empire strikes back. 
One of the downsides is Lando was brought it too late in this new triology and really he deserved to be brought in earlier. On a positive, the way Leia was kept in the final instalment despite Carrie Fisher's passing was handled very well."
"The movie was a good movie but it lacked a few major details in my opinion. At the end of the movie when Rey hears all of the past Jedi voices you hear Anakin Skywalker's voice. I was expecting more of Anakin as he was the first Skywalker to become a Jedi. We did see Luke as a force ghost help Rey, but what about Anakin? If he where to ever show up as a force ghost I think the best time would of been just before Rey defeats Emperor Palpatine. Now because Anakin was once Palpatine's apprentice he knew he enough about Palpatine that he could talk to Rey and tell her to get up and they would defeat him together. All the voices do end up giving Rey enough strength and courage to defeat Palpatine on her own, but if Anakin where there to help her the scene would of been much more powerful and stuck with the audience. Now I can't lie and say that all the past Jedi voices telling her to ‘Find the light'‘Get up' and that she was not alone and they had her back wasn't good because it was. Again Anakin would of made it more powerful because not only was he Palpatine's apprentice he was Luke's father and to mention Luke was Rey's master before he passed away. The Rise of Skywalker really did link these last three movies together, but if Anakin was more than just a voice and was a force ghost I feel it would of linked all nine movies as he was the one to start all this. It wasn't just Anakin either it was also Finn. While Finn and Rey are sinking in the sand Finn says he has something to tell Rey. Now most people would be thinking it was ‘I love you', because they thought they were about to die but what if it was something different. At the end of the movie Finn can feel Rey dying ,but only people with potential Jedi powers can sense those things right? Because Finn never told Rey his secret it leaves the audience wondering if his secret was that he was a Jedi all along and that's why he couldn't fulfill his duty as a stormtrooper. Beside Anakin and Finn the movie wasn't bad. A few details here and there, but I would recommend this movie to a Star Wars fan and see what they think. These are just some of my opinions and what I thought could of been better. Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker is a good movie it just had a few tweaks here and there that needed to be adjusted."
Can't go wrong with the newest STAR WARS movie. Especially with JJ Abrams back on board. All expectations are met with the only minor flaw being that it's overwhelming amount of complex space politics can only be completely understood by the most hardcore fans of the franchise.
This movie closes better than the third the saga. At this point it's difficult to be original and popular in the same time. JJ abrahms is a real entarteiner.
"The only character that I care about is kylo ren and I was looking forward to see his arc in this final skywalker saga. But...no...they killed the only remaining skywalker so someone else can be the one!!!
They wasted Adam driver talent for this??!!!!"
Who is to blame the one who wreck the ship motor or the one who crashed it ?
"First, no one cares what the critics think except maybe their mothers, but that just supporting their little person. However, in this case, they are correct. This movie was horrible. I would say it ended the franchise as JJ's reboot of Star Trek did to that franchise.  But to be fair, Ryan did that. The only way to see this movie is because, well, you wasted your life on the last two, so screw it."
"I'm a big Star Wars fan.  This is a bad movie.  It's corny nearly every second that Rey and Kylo Ren AREN'T on the screen.  70% of this movie is cringing to corny lines by the other actors. Finn is THE WORST...everything the character says is stupid or cheesy and the acting is just bad. 
This movie was made for children or for people who like Fast & Furious.  There is nothing good about it...its just a giant waste of time and an embarassment for people who love the franchise.  I'll stick to the originals and Rogue One and pretend none of these other childish garbage films were made."
"This film was better than TLJ but lacks any sense of imagination and uniqueness as a story and a film. JJ spent more time retconning the events of TLJ than actually telling a story. This film is plagued by fan service i.e giving chewie his medal for ANH. If you look as this film by itself it is a decent movie, however if you look at this film in the trilogy and the saga than you start to see some patterns that occur. Overall the film is a disappointing end to the Skywalker saga and you would be better off forgetting about this trilogy."
Great last chapter of the Star Wars Saga!
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Having seen the original in the theater, when I was 14, I have been captivated with each additional movie. I found this to be a fitting ending to the saga, and will be thrilled to add it to my collection."
A great way to end the series but sets up a lot of possibilities that do not follow thorugh.
"pointless, left literally angry at what they did"
Really enjoyed this one.
"Bringing back Palpatine turns this film in a wrost film of star wars, destroy all of was constructed in order films."
A disappointing end game for a legendary series. Too many holes and lack of continuity. A tragic end to what should have been an epic final. The cinema i watched it at had an underwhelmed audience who drifted off in the latter half of the movie. Should have used the director/ writer from the Mandalorian which was awesome.
"Better than 8(obviously) but still a bad movie. The humor is super cringey, the writing is awful, it again tries to feed off nostalgia, the plot is super weak, the visuals are amazing. This movie spends half the time undoing what happened in 8, the other half is less than mediocre. Predictably there is no story arc or character arcs across this trilogy."
"After the abysmal film that was The Last Jedi, I went into The Rise of Skywalker pessimistic. But regardless I wanted to see the movie because I am a Star Wars fan and I wanted to give my honest opinion on it. So after renting it on prime video and watching it. To my surprise, I loved the movie. It was entertaining, fast-paced, and action-packed. Most importantly it felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie. It was back to being a space adventure movie about good vs evil. The Last Jedi, while a Star Wars movie, felt more like a miserable nightmare. Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, subverted expectations, didn't answer any questions, and disrespected the saga. JJ Abrams came in and cleaned up the mess after The Last Jedi.

We get our heroes back working together in Rey, Poe, Finn, C3P0, BB8, and Chewie. We learn about Rey and why she is strong with the force. We finally also get to see her train with Leia. It was also great to see Rey have an internal struggle with figuring out who she is and where she fits in the galaxy. It made her character seem more human. Kylo Ren continues to be the best part of the sequel trilogy. The scenes with him and Rey are the best parts of the movie. We also get more back story with Poe and Finn. C3P0 and Chewie also really get there moments to shine in the movie. Luke Skywalker is back to being the optimistic mentor who respects his father's lightsaber again. I thought they did a great job of handling with Leia after Carrie Fischer passed away. Seeing Lando again was also a nice touch. And the new characters that get introduced (like Zorri Bliss, Babu Frik, Jannah, and General Pryde) are also really good additions to the story. Emperor Palpatine was pretty cool as well. A lot of his senses felt like something out of a Horror movie. The visual effects were outstanding. Especially in the space battle scenes. The lightsaber fight scenes were intense as well. I thought the movie had a nice and fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  

The only issues I had with the movie was the Nights of Ren were underutilized. I would have like to see more of who they are and a bit of there origin. There were some other minor issues here and there but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. 

Overall, I loved Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. It was nice to have JJ Abrams come in a finish what he started with The Force Awakens. As someone who was personally disappointed with The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker really helped patch things up for me. I commend JJ Abrams for doing so. (You could even watch Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker back to back while plucking out The Last Jedi completely.) This movie and The Mandalorian have reinvigorated my faith in Star Wars. I am looking forward to seeing what comes next. 

Overall score: 9/10"
"Great movie with lots of awesome scenes, the ending was weird though."
Only good character is kylo ren and his redemption arc was just a crappy rehash of Vader's redemption
"A one-dimensional, boring, forgettable, predictable, cliche, derivative, formulaic mess meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator and get the highest box office value. Endgame actually put time, effort, and thought into their franchise, but this feels more like Game of Thrones Season 8. Ridiculous pacing and a parody of its former self. With the cringe comedy of The Big Bang Theory and the manufactured drama of a soap opera, I am baffled as to how professional writers were paid any amount of money to write this movie. No memorable dialogue or reveals, no compelling plot points, and nothing of substance. Maybe the back and forth between Rey and Kylo was okay, but that's it. Feel free to take a bathroom break at any point."
"No risks taken, weak story (and I mean WEAK. It is even STUPID at some points, nearly as bad as the last Jedi), uninteresting characters and everything seems rushed. You don't even get time to breathe or even try to understand the plot."
The movie felt like they were trying to save the story from the garbage that Rian Johnson put it in.
"Wow this movie is hilarious! It doesn't quite scale the comedic heights of that chuckle inducing  masterpiece, 'The Last Jedi', but it's still pretty funny never the less. I would say it's a little strange that Disney would take arguably the greatest sci-fi movie franchise in history, and turn it into a comedy franchise, but few could argue that they're not funny. Also very pretty. The rise of Palpatine is a comedy of epic coincidences, that once again is stunning and brave in the way it has dealt with the franchise cannon, and total disregard and seemingly hatred for any of the origional characters and massive passionate fan base. 
If I were to walk into my favourite steakhouse, order (and pay for) a steak, only to be told that, no you're  wrong, you're getting the fish, then I would have to leave and never support that business again. Same here, I walked into my favourite sci-fi franchise and paid for some great swashbuckling sci-fi adventure, with gripping plots and characters I cared about. At least twice now I have been sold a comedic turd. Vacant and soulless. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, still shame on you. Disney killed Star Wars. RIP."
"This film is a fitting example of how a billionaire corporate company can annihilate something that was something short of a masterpiece (the original trilogy). This film was an insult, not just to the fans but to the universe's creator, George Lucas. He entrusted Disney to continue what he sold in a hope that his films will go on, only for his ideas and story to be completely shot down into flames, casting him out of having any say in what was to happen to his own franchise. They spent the majority of the film retconning every tiny mistake Rian Johnson created in The Last Jedi, meaning the film felt more like damage control than an actual story being put in place. The lightsaber battles were bland and had no emotional connection to the characters I felt. The choreography wasn't great, but was definitely an upgrade from The Last Jedi's choreography. One of the only redeeming qualities this film holds is the great score composed by John Williams, shame this was his last one. The film was nice to look at, at certain times. This film manipulated the audience by using nostalgia from the previous films as a walking stick to get from start to the finishing line, and god is it noticeable. It completely derails character arcs such as Finn's and Rey, but most of all, the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker. Watch the film at your own risk. What a terrible way to end the saga, it didn't land nor did it do the character's justice or its predecessor films. This was awful."
Without Rey it's nothing but still not enough to make it worth the name Star Wars.
"Terrible pacing, ridiculous (even for a science fiction/fantasy) plot, retread of long dead emperor, a massive secret fleet ? Who are the crew of this massive fleet? You'd think they'd show a commander, no? Ray's self discovery continues, boringly.... Just tiresome nonsense with some obligatory light saber fights bla bla bla."
"A very lacking experience, with numerous plot-holes, the whole thing just redid everything the other two did wrong but worse. Every new character was just like Phasma - does nothing then disappears. The story was confusing, and a lot happened that made no sense. I can't really get into it without spoiling anything, but the movie was quite lackluster.

Of course the CGI and special effects were great, but for story, the movie is a waste of time."
We loved this movie! If I could give it 10 stars I would!
This movie was mediocre because of how things just didn't make sense.
Disgraceful conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.
Felt very forced. It really felt like that they were forcing a new plot.  As a longtime Star Wars fan I am very disappointed. And on a new note where was Hayden Christensen? 🤣
"It is far from the best SW movie but the acting is great it is very entertaining,  It could have been an amazing movie but it's to short runtime made it average."
Disney garbage for the canon will not be considered. In the oven such a story. This cancels all the first six episodes.
"WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE

Overall, this movie was disappointing. If it wasn't a Star Wars film, I would have liked it. But this just didn't follow a Star Wars logic. I'm not saying all Star Wars films have to be the same, but this just had so many plot holes that a regular Star Wars movie wouldn't have. The story in general was just stupid and rushed. If you know Star Wars, you know that Palpatine was killed by getting thrown off of the Death Star. And somehow, without explanation, TROS brought Palpatine back. Bringing a dead character back is stupid, and without explanation? Come on! That was the biggest plot hole for me, but there were many others. In the last Star Wars film, The Last Jedi (which was even worse than TROS), our hero Luke Skywalker had passed away. Jedi can come back as force ghosts, and Luke did. But here's the thing: force ghosts cannot interact with the real world. They can talk to certain people, but they cannot use the force on real things in the real world. Anyway, the ghost Luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for Rey. Let me say that again. The ghost Luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for Rey. In Star Wars, that cannot be done! It does not apply to Star Wars logic! Another thing I didn't like about TROS was the unoriginality. Kylo Ren was the antagonist, but in the end, he became good. I wouldn't have a problem with that- if it were original. In the original Star Wars trilogy, Darth Vader became good! Making Kylo Ren come to the light side was so cliche and unoriginal! For me, you can only do that with one character in this franchise- and that character was Darth Vader. My very last error I would like to talk about is simply the fact that things happened way too fast. It was almost impossible to follow the story. They just jumped right into it without any sort of development. As much as I would like to go over more plot holes, I will now go over what I did enjoy. For all Star Wars movies, the music is great. I could say the same about TROS. John Williams has once again done a good job. Another thing I liked was the action. The one fight where Rey fought Kylo Ren was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole movie. There were plenty more good action scenes as well. My overall review for this movie is 2.5 stars out of 5."
It's good. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎
"Terrible film in a terrible sequel series. Why did fans like this? Oh yeah, blind nostalgia."
"I was disappointed in many aspects of this film. I wasn't a fan of the new force that can teleport objects. The entire series the New Order had been likened to Nzis (from outfits, to speeches, to how they walked), which would make Kylo Ren Hitler.  5 minutes after Kylo reforms himself Rey kisses him. What?? If you value your time skip this film"
All I can say is the critics got this one wrong. This was actually good.
"Dirigida a todos sus fans, ésta película es desenfrenada desde los prólogos y se hace lugar por si misma omitiendo varios cosas de The Last Jedi. Por esto, en distintas ocasiones, la trama se ve bastante ayudada por distintas casualidades. A pesar de todo, mantiene un alto nivel de efectos especiales y la espectacularidad que caracteriza a Star Wars, llevando así a un gusto final para la saga y los fanes, pero no tanto para los críticos de películas."
"Better than the last one... on most aspects... but huge plot holes and filled with Deus ex machina. Bland conversations and cheesy feel good actions that are quite ridiculous. It relies almost only on nostalgia because of their incompetence of creating a credible Star Wars atmosphere. Sad. 
The best thing would be to pretend this new trilogy never existed."
"Mira, de momento no puedo aprobar esta película, y no solo por su horrible guión, sino por el hecho de que este se siguiera. Esta cinta demuestra que nunca hubo un verdadero peso creativo en la nueva saga, que nadie llevaba el timón y algunos de los que prentendían hacerlo ni se molestaron en intentarlo de verdad. Un guión tan absolutamente garrafal y mal construido deberia estar prohibido viniendo de lo que se supone ser una de las mejores compañías del mundo (Disney), la parte de la industria más relevante (Hollywood) y una de las franquicias mas influyentes de la historia. Es una verguenza. No lo digo como fan solo, sino como creador también.

La salva algun que otro momento entretenido y grandes efectos especiales, punto."
I loved it and I just can't understand this critic score at all I think this was an amazing movie and a heart touching and emotional end to trilogy if not saga.
It was alright. Not the best. Better tho than The Last Jedi.
"This was the only sequel trilogy member I actually enjoyed. The Force Awakens failed to excite me much, while I frankly disliked The Last Jedi. I'll say it's among my top 3 of the total 9, sitting at maybe #2 overall.

It reeks of fan service, but hey, I am a fan."
"When watching the movie, there was a lot happening to take in. Yes, I feel the movie answered many questions, and yes I also do feel The Rise of Skywalker ties in nicely with The Force Awakens, therefore leaving out The Last Jedi which to me is great."
Boring boring boring boring...need I say more? What shameful ending to an original masterpiece
"Made no sense, horrible plot decisions when there were so many other good ways to go."
Not a perfect film but it exceeds in what it's trying to do
"My review of this movie may be controversial, but I loved this movie. I think I almost passed out from the action, which I loved. There was so much to answer, and they answered all of it. One downside was that they tried to fit too much in, but that didn't hurt the movie too much. It was just a masterpiece and a great way to end a saga going for 42 years."
Rushed and chaotic. Filled with plot holes and breaks what was previously stablished for its own nonsense benefit. Not trully planned nor a real Star Wars story.
A fairly good movie but the problem with Star Wars is they kill so many people like it is all in a days work and on every planet they never use space suits which is ridiculous. The movie was rushed and could have been a hour longer.
"It's so sad, so many childhood memories destroyed, and it gets worst than that"
"I laughed through the first two hours. It was like someone created a list of all the Star Wars characters and best moments instead of doing some serious writing, and the producers accepted it. After two hours, the movie caught my attention like any good movie. I would watch this again for the laughter snd the quality ending."
"I really liked it when Rey was revealed to be a Palpatine. what I don't really like about the film is I feel like at the beginning when Poe and the crew were lightspeed skipping, I feel like that was a bit rushed. But other than that I really liked the film. Good Job guys!"
O MY God... Disney completely  killed all of George Lucas's work and creativity from my point of view. I wish I could have unwatched the trilogies that came after the death of Darth Vader.
"Terrible. Just as the two movies before that one. Just like George Lucas said: ""There is nothing new."" Just a boring collection of stuff stolen from the first three (good) movies."
That is not how the Star Wars sequel trilogy ends.
This movie throws everything we that was abstablished out the window and saids ha no. Every single scene in this movie made me think that makes no sense and that stupid. The characters in this become kinda boring to watch. Force healing is one of the stupidest thing added in this and this movie doesn't deserve to be called a star wars movie
"I was hoping that for the end of the Star Wars saga, the final chapter would have been spectacular. But I was sadly disappointed in this film...after all of the hype, this film did not live up to the expectations of the ""Final"" Star Wars film or the ""conclusion"" of the main Star Wars chapters.  

The movie was not terrible, and I would recommend watching this film if you are a fan of Star Wars, but it was disappointing how the final chapter was scripted, particularly the storyline was not surprising whatsoever.  

I would give this 2.5 stars if not for the excellent acting by the cast, and the fact that it is the final Star Wars film from the main storyline."
jj you failed us. you tried to please everyone and yet you pleased no one. i am numb from this being the last star wars episode. this gave me no hope. palpatine won in the end. all the skywalker s are dead
"It was an awful film, mainly because of the comedic film before it (The Last Jedi).  If The Last Jedi had followed what The Force Awakens set up, then this might have been a good conclusion.  Bringing back Palpatine was just desperate by Disney and Abrams.  Shockingly bad film.  Luke raises the X Wing which he should have done in Last Jedi, Rey gets taught by Leia etc etc. Very poor film.  I do not recommend anyone to watch this.  The Force Awakens and Rogue One are the only decent Disney Star Wars to watch.

The building of the Star Destroyers was also desperate, and they were built underground.  They don't know the way up?  Anything that goes away from the earth they just rose up out of is up.  ""They can't tell which way is up out there"". What an awful script, awful story, which followed on from the ruins of The Last Jedi.  Terrible film and terrible sequel after The Force Awakens."
Oh boy just terrible.
"I went to the theatre thinking to myself :"" well the last jedi was bad, but maybe this last movie will have more action, a better story an well ... more star wars"" but honestly it barely felt like anybody thought about the plot or the characters. The movie is full of moments that are made to make newborn babies laugh but if you're any older than two weeks it's just taking you out of the story. Honestly, it's still better than the second one but, even with all the action in the movie I just found it boring and uninteresting. It just felt like I was watching a bad parody movie that was supposed to copy star wars. It was just sad."
"Not even so bad it's funny, it's just bizarre. This is nothing about pleasing hardcore fans and pissing off others, it is just an out and out badly made film. Unwatchable."
"No. Wanted to like it, I really did. Just no."
"Was expecting it to be along the lines of Rogue One but it really left a lot to be desired. I do have to admit, it was better than the Last Jedi. Not much but a little"
I feel that since the Force Awakens the films haven't been as good and sadly this film falls into that category. Emperor Palpatine is one of my favourite Star Wars characters but I felt underwhelmed about his return. I feel the previous films were so good why introduce old characters like Emperor Palpatine. But what I really disliked was that Rey is now a Skywalker. That bothered me.
"This is quite possibly, literally the worst movie I have ever seen.  Every frame is an insult to cinema.  Every line is vacant, every scene vacuous.  The pacing challenges the best of human perception - one really needs multiple viewings to take in the full breadth of mediocrity on offer. Imagine Batman 4ever but with 5x the budget and zero imagination and you just had a passing thought that is more cohesive that this movie.  If all of the errors, disappointment, failure, and unresolved potential of Season 8 of Game of Thrones could be distilled into a single movie it would not be near as unsatisfying and distasteful as this movie.  This movie is an insult to the human spirit.  I put more effort into this bs review than the writers put into the script.  I can't believe this movie was actually made.  This is real?  This fugin movie was actually filmed, edited, and realeased..."
"the good people always win, the bad people always lose, also good people never die and also bad people always die. but i don't get it why you kill the bad guy who came back to light. damn i love that character. come on break the rules make some different. That's get more and more predictable."
"For a movie, It was good. As a fan though, this is more that just any movie. If a certain important main character hadn't been killed off at the end, I'd give it a five."
"Many of the issues with The Rise of Skywalker don't stem from actual problems with the film, but more so Abrams and company trying to retcon everything the previous director had done with The Last Jedi, instead on focusing on making the literal last film in a saga and delivering on it. This trilogy's strong point was in its beginning, with The Force Awakens, and with a director-change, it feels so discombobulated. I won't even get in to the fact of how disappointing the return of Emperor Palpatine is either."
Nothing like the original StarWars.....story line all over the map....
"Driver and Ridley were reasonable. The rest of the acting was questionable at best. The script and plot were horrible. Cinematography and sound track were good but fell short of great. Overall, a major disappointment for a movie I had high hopes for."
"Where is the 88% of audience members that liked this movie. This movie was so unoriginal. I had hope that JJ was gonna fix it. If you saw Return of the Jedi, you have seen this movie. Don't bother."
"I don't love the Star Wars films the way some do; I saw them as a child, I enjoyed them, and I bought a few related toys. But they never retained the place in my affection they have for some. With the 9-film cycle now concluded with this film, I look back and count a total of 3 decent films; let's be honest, 33% is not a great hit rate (Return Of The Jedi, and the first two films in this latest trilogy). This one takes all that was good about the previous episode and tramples all over it with bad story-telling, a whole load of deus ex-machina that reach the level of absurd, and some decent performances struggling to make themselves heard above the din. I'm kind of glad it's all over, to be honest."
"Incredible. There's a lot of people (particularly online) who'll try and put this trilogy down, but there's no satisfying some people. The people who worked on this film love and care about Star Wars and this film reflects that. Don't listen to the hate."
I'm just going to pretend this last trilogy doesn't exist. Butchered it.
"Oh My God, It Is Official. I hope to God I never see another Star Wars movie ever again in my life.  Sweet Baby Jesus this was bad from start to finish. Only the most desperate star wars fans would want to see this drivel.  Script, direction, acting, dialogue, story, plot device, and on and on and on was offensive to the senses.  This is the equal to the Godzilla movies, where anyone who is not a pure zealot sees it for what it truly is...rubbish, and the Star Wars' ""War Boys"" will fight tooth and nail just to see anything of their god on film again.  J.J. Abrams just can't help but trash beloved well established film franchises. This movie was rubbish."
"The movie is enjoyable but doesn't make sense to that what we saw in the last jedi. There are also many things that would have been perfect in the movie, these things were also shot by the crew but were cut out from the end product (like anakin a focegohst oder a Finn&Poe kiss)"
I wish the movie was better. It has great moments in the first 1/2 and very poor in the second 1/2
"So blah. No risks, just generic fanboy service. I miss Lucas. He knew how to take risks and make something original."
"Lo único que tiene de bueno son los efectos visuales. La película es realmente mala, tiene muchas cosas sin sentido y los guiones son pésimos.

Solo la vi entera para ver como terminaba la saga, pero realmente no merece el tiempo."
"Garbage in its purest form, here Disney reaches the culmination of the destruction of the first 6 films, passing through the lining all the mythology of Star Wars, throwing x the toilet the prophecy of the chosen one, putting some insufferable protagonists with whom I am not capable to empathize, despising R2d2, making Rey more powerful than Master Yoda just by training for a few months, making him win a Palpatine in the end and to finish shitting everything seen until episode 6 taking the Skywalker surname. All this in broad strokes because if I start to make one more criticism, my idle would spend the whole night."
How does JJ Abrams still get to make movies? I love Star Wars with all of my heart. This was like fan fiction written by a group of school kids.
It was awful. To fast. Not logical. Dumb conversations (realy dumb). No explaining how palpatine came back and how he was able to create such a huge army. In all it was dumb movie. Disney should ne ashamed and should sell the rights dir the movie. Disney destroys star wars with all the dumb stuff.
The franchise has lost it focus.
"The time for craping on Star Wars is at an end. Sorry folks we just didn't get the series we hoped for.  In the Rise of Skywalker, we get a sincere attempt by those involved to give a disappointed fan base a solid final outing.  As a fan, I appreciate it. However, in the end, the entire Star Wars saga comes down to the marvelous, mysterious, Rey being manipulated into hating Palpatine so she can join the dark side because she is (SPOILER) Familia.  After all, Disney is a family company. Not only is she related to grampa Palpatine (who actually is a clone of her Grandfather) but she also is related to all the Jedis who have come before her because...the force. Its ridiculous, its a bit derivative and played out, but it's well-acted, the film looks great, there are a lot of fun action scenes and it's one last time to hear John Williams expand his melodic universe.  And Disney, just some advice, next time use Dave Filoni and not Katleen Kennedy."
better than Last Jedi and Solo but way worse than Rouge One and Force Awankens
Not as bad as TLJ. At least it's finally over.
Had some weird plot twists
"Worst pacing ever, so many flaws after flaws after flaws with storytelling. After watching all the movies and side movies, and all animated shows, this is the WORST STAR WARS Movie Ever made."
Great ending for the new trilogy. I loved every minute of it. Star Wars is alive!
"It had its moments, but it story was very disappointing."
"This feels like a major step back from the previous film, one devoid of creativity or passion"
When I saw this movie I had to really think about how I felt about it. It's not bad but it could've been way better. Characters could've been explained better and the story could've been explained better. The plot is really messy and the acting is okay. The humor is toned down a lot compared to the Last Jedi but overall I think this was a disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. This trilogy could have been way better than it was and it is really disappointing the decisions that were made. So it's fine but could have been a lot better
"I thought the acting and producing was brilliant, highly recommend"
"Rise of Skywalker is amazing but, you can’t end the Skywalker saga"
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Since I was a kid, I have LOVED star wars; from a New Hope to Revenge of the Sith. The newest trilogy, while it is visually sufficient (it's a star wars movie) the story line literally regurgitated the original (ep 4-6) with one exception: Palpatine. Of course, I'm talking about ""legends"" star wars (since I don't recognize the new star wars, its cannon) where Palps had hundreds of clones; plus, Ben Solo wasn't evil, his older brother Jacen Solo was (complicated story). This movie leaves more questions than answers and was a complete waste of time to actual star wars fans. It's just a travesty, over used cash grab and I regret watching this film."
Star Wars 9 é o melhor filme de todos os tempos
"So I've seen and read numerous reviews by raging nerds, who deny themselves fun because whatever star wars lore they bought into. Please, do not let those reviews spoil YOUR fun with the movie - sure there are some minor plot-holes here, but let's be frank : who the hell cares, if you can't hyper-space skip in milennium falcon. Since the nerd culture is now mainstream, it seems there's easily milions of people who care for such bs. And yes I too was raised watching original Star Wars on VHS and yes I too despise the prequels. That said, I utterly enjoyed watching and rewatching the new trilogy, including this one which made so many ""critics"" salty. See the glass half full, take the zen approach is my advice here. The light side will help you overlook some minor lore-heresies (pointed out by sith possesed youtubers) and just give in to the spectacle. That's it, now go and watch it."
"This did justice to the series. I was entertained, with the action, characters, and storyline all pretty well done."
I thought the story was good but should have been great considering this was the end of the legendary Skywalker arc. Or is it? Hmmm the way it ended leaves you hoping for a whole new Skywalker arc. The acting was average which diminished the quality of the film also by the end I really thought Finn and the other cat were annoying. Thankfully Daisy Ridley saved the movie!
"Rian was right. Don't make films for fans. If you want to enjoy star wars, rewatch the prequels. JJ had a tall order; it's not that he failed; he never really had a chance to succeed. Disney was single handily the best and the worst thing to happen To the franchise."
"Full Disclosure: I am 45 years old. My Mom and Dad took me to my first movie at age 3. Guess which movie........ Star Wars in 1977!!! It changed my life!!! I am so happy with the direction that the franchise has gone. Episode 1, 2, and 3, yeah I get it, a little cheesy. Still loved each movie. Episodes 7, 8, and 9, ABSOLUTELY loved what J.J. did!!! Thank You sir! Would love a Rey Skywalker solo movie........"
I'd rather have spent the time doing something else. It hard to keep watching a series that didn't go anyway but most of all it was even fun to watch. Was the 2nd best of new trilogy but of all the movies it'd be 8th out of 9 of the rest of Full series
Great starwars fun. I enjoyed the plot and character twists. The jokes were good and story was great.
"I got so immersed into this movie that I at one point shed a tear. I even laughed because I was so happy about things happening in the movie. I have been pretty invested in Star wars lore. I am a big fan.

This might be the best movie I have watched in years. and I watch a lot of movies.
My advice. Make your room pitch dark, bring some snacks. Put this movie on and enjoy.

EAT FRESH."
It's a very bland movie that doesn't know what it wants to be and has too many plots in one film but I enjoyed Ian McDiarmid back as Palpatine and most of the acting was pretty good
"J. J. Abrams has failed. With a poorly-paced, oddly-written (the dialogue is comparable to that of the Prequels), ailing film, the Skywalker saga is over. Protagonists are unlikable. Palpatine has (somehow) managed to bore me. I am quite convinced the initial script simply read ""Insert deus ex machina here"". The film does feel like a preschooler playing with his older brother's Star Wars toys. Character arcs are nonexistent. Individuals once cunning, such as Mr. Sheeve, are now moustache-twirling knuckleheads incompetent past belief. Half of the film revolves around our cast of ""protagonists"" working off the information of an imperial defector to find the Palpaplanet. There are far too few redeeming qualities. Unlike most Abrams films, ROS is anything but visually pleasing. Random and unnecessary references are shoved in unnaturally. The Knights of Ren are dumber than B1 Battle Droids. Lando magically show up on some desert planet at the perfect time. Overall, this is the petty conclusion to a great series."
"J.J. Abrams is a genius! Fantastic ending to an impossibly difficult multifaceted story. Great fun. Wonderfully acted. Incredibly cool visuals that J.J. Abrams is known for. As a huge Star Wars fan since the first movie came out in 1977, I think this is the best possible ending to the Skywalker saga I could've hoped for. Bravo J.J. Abrams!"
This movie totally sucked. Didn't captivate me in the slightest bit. All I could think about was going home after the movie having to pee and I was unable to pay attention to any of the movie. It was just overall boring for whatever reason. Couldn't tell you anything about the story line.
I really enjoyed rise of the Skywalker yes it is probably like  marmite you ether love it or hate it .
"To be honest, the film was a let down. It reminded me of a fetch quest in a video game. Get the not ""holorcorn"" to find the..... I won't spoil the rest but you see where I'm going with this. The resurrection of what seemed like a completely destroyed Death Star form Ep. 6 was a flimsy choice at best. The film ties up loose strings such as snoke but, I didn't find them satisfying. All and all I'd rather watch Ep. 1 with a plot that is leading somewhere."
"Messy ending to a messy trilogy.
This whole trilogy was a lazy excuse for Disney to make money on the nostalgia of fans and their children"
"Not even remotely close, to being as good as any Lucas film..."
"The screenplay was a little bit confused, maybe the way the had to told the history into only two movies. Even thought is still a Star Wars, wich is very hard to give a bad review. Just didn't like the way the use some tools in order to solve the whole story. Besides that, considering the photo, special effects and so... you won't waste your time."
This was a great way to end the franchise in the Skywalker story and easter eggs from the very beginning calling back to the very first movie this was a fantastic end
"A huge mess..Non existent dialogue, zero character development, flat story...I couldn't find anything good in this ""movie"" and i really tried"
Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker was from my point of view wars very fast paste. There were not a lot of twists and turns which makes movie not as entertaining as other movies of the trilogy because you can guess what will happen so easily. And the film was not an original idea it was pretty much like the episode six. Over all it passes the time but it definetly was not a master piece.
"Damn shame. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker shows an immense lack of imagination for the future of Star Wars in my opinion. I was a big fan of The Last Jedi. I thought it pushed the series into bold new directions and for a while there I was super excited for the future of the Star Wars franchise. But, none the less. The Rise of Skywalker squanders that. With an unfocused plot, poor character choices, dull scenes, and bland execution, the concluding chapter of the Skywalker saga is only kept above the surface, by great music, performances, and a likable cast.
New plotlines are suddenly introduced without much reason to be there. Muggufuns are brought in and abandoned. Character's pasts are revealed, but they are either contradictory to the other two films or fail to be given an enough time to develop. Paced in seemingly a breakneck, yet at the same time so boring its slow way. You will either love the movie or hate it, with not much in between. A movie meant to reunite the fanbase only ended up dividing it more. I could go on. This film left me with a sense of lost hope for the franchise because everything that we had been building up too ended up being that the only way to defeat the emperor, would be to use two lightsabers instead of one. ""Ah, that's what we were missing this whole time."" If you are a Star Wars fan you have already made up your mind on it. And if you're a casual audience member you won't end up caring all that much anyway."
This movie was really amazing. I loved this movie. This is Star Wars! It was a good movie. Was it perfect? No. Was it great? Yes! It had alot of fan service. I really enjoyed it!
"I've always been a fan of Star Wars, I loved every minute of this. No idea why some people slated it. Brilliant."
The final entry and conclusion to the epic Star Wars saga is a huge improvement from its predecessor but still doesn't live up to the episode that started the trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker is riddled with familiar tropes and cliches which is surprising as it's directed by J. J. Abrams who directed The Force Awakens. It seems his vision for the trilogy took a bad turn when Rian Johnson took the reins for The Last Jedi. Yet there's a lot to enjoy in the action sequences and nostalgic bits so it's worth the time of you watched the first two movies.
They should've focused on a better script rather than pushing up nostalgia down our throats.
"I thought it was pretty good. The last one wasn't. No surprise the ""critics"" are so far apart from the audience on both of these."
"This movie took a lot of heat when it came out but after re watching it I do like it. A few plot jumps but given the fact that they had to wrap up the saga they did a good job. 

The acting was passionate and real.  The special effects were outstanding and their ability to include unused Carrie Fisher footage in the film was a fabulous."
Really do not understand the hate for this movie. I just do not get it. I thought this was one of the best films of the franchise
"A laughably bad finale for the Skywalker sequel trilogy.

J.J. Abrams directed his space adventure movie Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) like it was his first movie by lifting shots and story beats from other classic movies all to attempt to recreate the magic that was A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. Boy, Abrams fails spectacularly alongside curiously incompetant producer Kathleen Kennedy calling the shots from the shadows like Emperor Palpatine. Just going back to Palpatine because they had no new ideas was a warning sign of this colossal waste of 142 minutes. Abrams' uninspired direction leaves much to be desired with the same old Star Wars ideas being tossed around by his unimaginative script. Whereas Rian Johnson disrespected Star Wars lore and concepts with The Last Jedi, J.J. Abrams worships Star Wars too much to try anything new at all.

I will start out with the few positive takeaways I got from The Rise of Skywalker. I like where this saga ends, Palpatine dead, Kylo redeemed, Rey independent with her own agency, Poe redeemed with a love interest, and Finn redeemed with a love interest. It's satisfying and respectful of Star Wars, George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. The Rey and Kylo lightsaber duel is passionate and thrilling, Rey challenging Kylo's fighter in the desert is cool, Finn having faith in The Force is nice, and lastly it's sweet of J.J. Abrams to give Mark Hamill a proper sendoff as Luke Skywalker the Jedi Master instead of his horrendous character assassination from Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Michael Kaplan's costumes are neat. I adore Rey's white Jedi robes and Kylo's black garb for sure. Overall, I liked these aspects at the very least.

The problem is everything else. The editing is unintelligible as you never know what is happening. The movie starts off with no real establishment of where characters are or what their actual motivations are now after The Last Jedi. A brief opening crawl is not nearly enough to engage you. The cinematography has a few neat camera choices with a striking wide shot of Rey inside the broken Death Star, the seaside lightsaber duel, or the A New Hope homage with Rey in the dual Sunsets. The issue is all the rest of the movie has this cheap CGI glow and overly cluttered mess on screen that you cannot follow anything.

Daisy Ridley is charming and cool as Rey Skywalker giving it her all in these awful films. She makes the whole movie watchable as Daisy is likable and relatable as Rey. She effortlessly fits into this space sci-fi adventure with her impressive combat choreography Ridley painstakingly learned and got fit for all while killing the dramatic acting. Adam Driver is excellent as Ben Solo with endearing dramatic suspense, while also being intimidating as the hulking Sith behemoth Kylo Ren. John Boyega finally gets to act normally as the likable Finn with Naomi Ackie as his new love interest Jannah. Oscar Isaac finally gets to act as the suave and charming Poe Dameron, especially endearing alongside the ravishing and cool Keri Russell as Zorii Bliss. I wish we saw more of Russell!

Carrie Fisher is good as General Leia Organa, but a far cry from her legendary performances as Princess Leia. She lost all her fire and warmth sadly. Rest in paradise, Carrie. We all miss you. Mark Hamill looks like he was relieved to get a nice moment with Rey as the wise and kind Luke Skywalker. Harrison Ford cameos with a tender, not phoned in for once, role alongside Driver. Billy Dee Williams is surprisingly endearing and charismatic still as Lando Calrissian. Ian McDiarmid remains phenomenal as Emperor Palpatine also known as Darth Sidious. Even Anthony Daniels is fun as C-3P0 even though Abrams focused more on the other droids.

Domhnall Gleeson is brushed aside as General Hux for a gag, meanwhile the imposing and talented Richard E. Grant gets little to do as Allegiant General Pryde. Lupita Nyong'o is wasted again as the ugly CGI creature Maz Kanata, who is supposed to be an oracle of sorts. I just wish they put Lupita in Star Wars in space alien make-up instead. Kelly Marie Tran got to redeem herself for her horridly overacted, awkward, and cringe inducing performance from The Last Jedi as she's very natural and likable as Rose Tico in The Rise of Skywalker. I adored seeing Billie Lourd cameo as Lieutenant Connix. I actually wish she got a much larger role. Too much time is wasted on odd subplots, ugly CGI monsters, goofy alien puppets, and ugly space battles instead of developing characters or telling an interesting story. Disney clearly couldn't care less.

Even John Williams' score sounded tired of Star Wars at this point. He gets a cute little cameo though. In all, I'm just glad we are all done with this mediocre franchise that used to capture our imaginations. The original trilogy will always be fun, the prequel trilogy is still embarrassing, and this sequel trilogy is a horrendous cash grab that recreated the previous films with no charm. Rest in peace Star Wars, I had fun with you for a time."
"Jumped the shark. Poor writing, looks great...but garbage."
"I'm not sure why everyone was so disappointed in this movie.  From all the negative press I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really liked it.  I liked the struggle that the characters had to discover who they really were and the ending.  Sorry the series is ending."
It's a good way to end the saga. Some questionable parts but overall must see
"Lucasfilm and Disney. They have such money, special effects, and abilities but made such... suc ... there is no logic, no explanation, no character development, no adequate idea. This is just a Guinness record, how not to do."
"JJ Abrams/Disney/Lucas totally dropped the ball on this one and have been doing ""Damage Control"" ever since.  Overlong disjointed lesson in how not to make a movie, let alone end a series.  Instead of story and plot you got pointless kung fu scenes and journeys to no where and the dredging up of long dead characters that made no sense.  The Luke Skywalker saga was done at the end of Return of the Jedi - the ONLY reason for bring back the old cast members for this trilogy was to introduce the new cast - but JJ Abrams or Disney or both seem to have last sight of that in their effort to utilized outtakes of the dead Cary Fisher instead of writing a real ending and paying for real - live- actors.  This movie is a train wreck from start to finish - and only serves to make you appreciate the excellent story telling of the Last Jedi more - Thanks Rian Johnson!"
"5.0/10 — ""Mediocre""/""Passable""

-(Seen on 4/12/20)"
"I watched Rise of Skywalker on bluray again. 
And it's even worse than I remember. 
Endless, meaningless side quests, interminable arguments over accessing a robot's hard drive, characters regressing to flat, one-dimensional plot devices.
Disney (or JJ Abrams) really thought ""The Trio"" was the main draw of the Sequel Trilogy. That's the only reason I can imagine for turning KyloRen/BenSolo into a supporting player whose only purpose it to deliver clunky backstory, then die and be forgotten."
A disgrace. This movie is incredibly dumb.
Disappointing finish to the most recent trilogy.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you JJ Abrams. The universe is again what it should be, as the trash that was The Last Jedi fades from a bad memory into nothingness."
"While I don't hate it as much as TLJ, TROS is without a doubt the worst written Star Wars film bar none."
"This movie lacked heart and soul. I used to really like Abrams, IDK what happened... It's a bad movie and a bad sequel in a terrible trilogy. It makes me so depressed when I brood about what Disney, Johnson and Abrams did to Star Wars :("
Loved it - most unique and exciting of the last three. Thought it was a great end to the Skywalker legacy
"I really don't understand why the critics hated this movie. I think JJ Abram did the right things to make a truly ""Star War"" movie instead of what he did with ""Last Jedi"", a good movie that please modern movie critics, but departs from energy and dynamics of Star Wars a little bit. I think people just need to chill. If you don't like the movie, maybe it is just that the movie is not for you.

As a Star War fan, this is a great movie and a suitable ending for this story arc."
"Having been a fan for 43 years, and trying hard to like it. This disjointed mess, was the crowning achievement in laying star wars to rest, by Disney.  The characters are two dimensional parodies. It's easier to pretend,  this and the past 2 films didn't exist, and preserve a childhood joyful memory."
"Poor planning and writing from the first two films caused this to be the worst film in the new trilogy.  It's a turd.  Existing fans should watch it to judge for themselves, but for all others it should be avoided.  The plot is horrible and feels like you are watching a knock off of National Treasure.  The clues to track down the new threat from the Empire don't make any sense.  And why would the empire hide valuable military resources when they could have been used earlier.  The force powers are also extremely exaggerated and several new abilities were created.  The final showdown is very anti-climatic and you will laugh as rebels run across the top of star destroyers.  Given the length of the film you will be wishing for it to be over.  They did wrap up the mystery of Rey's origins nicely, but the journey was painful to watch."
"The last episode of the latest Star Wars trilogy was sooooooooo bad, I cannot even give it one star. Not all the budget in the galaxy could have saved this movie. I can write a trilogy about why it was so bad, but let's summarize and say there was no story to tell. None. The movie keeps stealing from past glories, which could be fine as it is the continuation from an old story, but they just copy/paste and it just looks like a counterfeit  copy of what this story used to be. The bar scene at Planet Kijimi ? And Poe's scene about an unpaid debt? Really ? Give me a break!
So, check this movie if you are 9 years or younger. Plenty of kid-friendly scenes...is Disney's story after all. The empire won."
"The movie was very well done. After hearing all the criticism, I expected less than what the movie was. I get that many fans were butthurt because the story didn't go the way they wanted, but get over it. This was a great movie."
"The plot here is just incoherent. J.J. Abrams obviously had to do back flips to try and undo Last Jedi, and Ep. 9 really suffers for it. ""The Room"" makes more sense logically. I liked Last Jedi better, and I'm probably in the minority. RoS has great looking set pieces, a few good and funny moments, and a few cool x-wing and lightsaber fights, but it's a disappointment. The characters in this trilogy have been ridiculously overpowered. Maybe in these 3 movies or in ep. 9 it explains how they can just resurrect ppl via the force, but I certainly couldn't tell you how based on this jumbled mess of a trilogy. The worst thing is, it could easily have been epic."
"Such a bad episode. I am a fan, but seriously? Clearly could have been done better."
Too much story in one movie. A bit silly story line especially on the revival of the emperor.
The worst and cringiest ending to an amazing modern trilogy. Waste of 40 + years of amazing character development. Just terrible.
Finally watched it online for free. Too much going on that it's confusing and feels that it should of been a game not a movie. It didn't connect well to the others. Episode 6 was a better end to the Skywalker saga. These sequelogy should of been planned better. This is NOT the BEST of the Skywalker saga. There is no Skywalker left. Rey isn't a Skywalker and she'll never be a Skywalker. A Skywalker can be named by blood and she doesn't have the blood which means she has to marry to become a Skywalker but do not say she is because she is definitely not. Reboot the sequelogy PLEASE!!!
Ill make it short and sweet. The force is apparently broken and now you can do any and everything especially... I best not give them any idea's.
"Discordando da maioria dos críticos, achei muito bom o filme, não vou dizer que seja perfeito mas isso nenhum é, por isso dou 5 estrelas"
"Disappointing end to one of the greatest stories ever told. This one was better than the last one. just narrowly. The first installment of the new trilogy skated by on nostalgia and a general thirst for new Star Wars. Unfortunately Disneys acquisition proves this was all about money and pumping out as much Star Wars as quickly as possible with complete disregard for the property itself. This and the last felt hastily written and sloppy. It could just be that I grew up with Vader and the original characters, but I had a hard time believing or feeling like Kylo or Rey were so much stronger than their predecessors. The original trilogy had 3 year breaks between movies, both of these last two could have used at least an extra year, especially after the last one had to be rewritten. Snoke felt like a total throw away and why they didnt take that opportunity to insert a more compelling already existing character from the expanded universe or whatever its called now is a missed opportunity. It feels like Snoke was being built for something else and then plans changed quickly so they killed him. Why rush one of the most legendary and beloved stories ever? If it wasnt ready, delay and rewrite, people may be upset, but is that worth ruining Star Wars over? I suppose it is if youre only interested in money and could care less about ruining art. I could go on and on about everything that didnt work, but its easy enough to find those with a simple search. They may as well have ended this by having Jar Jar being the mastermind behind everything, studying the dark side and re-emerging as Darth Jar Jar killing everyone and flipping off the camera."
Such a terrible finish for the new trilogy.  Same old formula.  A surprise real father revelation.  Bad guy gets redemption.  Rebels win.  Blah blah blah.
Same old same old. Drowning in cliches such as the mandatory wrist wraps and leather arm bands as expected from a Hollywood obsessed with wrist protection. Still better than the f* finger to fans The Last Jedi though. I was a super fan until that one
"Never listen to the critics. Audience score only.

Excellent ending to this Triology."
It was entertaining.
"This movie took 0 risks,  it utilized the original characters as background stand-ins like a tree in a child's christmas play. It introduced it's main villain after 40 years in a text scroll. Anytime you thought someone died or sacrificed themselves they were brought back, making almost every scene meaningless. This by far is the worst Star Wars movie ever."
"*SPOILERS* I really felt like this film was made by someone with ADHD, this little review will be done the same way to honor it.  Those scenes in the first half went so fast, with so much happening it became really hard to care at all about anything as there was no time to let anything breathe.  Cast chasing after a thing that doesn't really matter, new supporting characters that are introduced that don't really matter either.  Stupid banter between Finn and Poe.  Rey continues being a Mary Sue.  Kylo Ren was the best imo, definite improvement to his character after TLJ, wish the writers were better to him.  Bringing back Emperor Palpatine?  No other ideas than to bring back an old character and ruining Return of the Jedi?  Hux?  Pfft.  Overall plot absurd.  Constant reminder of other films though.  Ceasar from Planet of the Apes.  Sandworms of Arrakis.  

Oh and Finn had something he wanted to tell Rey.  Said so multiple times but never did.  Okay then...  Oh and he's Force sensitive or something?  Maybe?  Hinted but went nowhere again.  What was that stupid fight on horseback on top of Star Destoryers?  Force lightning that destroys entire ships.... Sigh."
"I personally adore the movie despite the pacing, writing choices, and plot points in film, but it ties everything together in a proper satisfying way to make a proper satisfying ""Star Wars"" finale. I couldn't be more in love with this movie than I've ever been with episode 7 & 8. JJ Abrams you stick the landing"
A very thrilling and fun conclusion to the sequel trilogy with some missteps along the way. But still really enjoyable!
If you thought the Last Jedi was bad...oh boy
This was unwatchable. It took me three sittings just to finish it as I kept getting irritated by the awful acting and poor writing in this film.
"Me mantuvo entretenido, eso es lo que cuenta."
"8.6:10 I liked it. I can see where the criticism of “fan service” comes from, but who doesn’t like a nice ending? I’m also not a giant Star Wars nerd to begin with."
"Entertaining, but not the conclusion I had hoped for after Episode 7 and 8 (both of which I loved)! Pacing is kind of a mess and I'm not a huge fan of the Palpatine stuff. The best/most redeeming part of this movie is Kylo Ren's growth as a character. As a film it's okay, but a bit disappointing. I'm still hopeful for the rumored JJ extended cut which might fix some of the pacing issues at least despite some of the story choices that I disagree with."
best star wars fillm ever is as good as the orignal Trilogy i love it it had a great ending for the saga
"Plot hole after plot hole that was somehow supposed to tie this whole trilogy together... As generic as it gets for casual viewers, 100 trivia pieces for fanatics who know the lore down to that star wars lego booklet from 1997."
"What should have been an epic finale to a 9-Part 40+ year series is instead a half baked, barely sensical nostalgia trip that runs out of gas far before its conclusion. The screenwriters should have spent more time in the writing room, and less time listening to the trolls."
Absolutely deplorable
Awesome ending to this saga. I wish Abrams would have done all three.
"One of the worst movies ever, I guess the fault is from the Last Jedi since there wasn't much to do about it."
"This is by far the star wars movie that has unsettled me most from all of the previous installments. I consider myself a fairly big fan of Star Wars but this film seemed to break all of the rules set in the other movies. Fast paced and relentless, I did not seem to have the time to enjoy moments that could have been taken advantage of in a much larger scale. It is a fairly good way of ending the Skywalker saga but it did not appeal to me."
"I really like this movie. The reason why is that it felt like a Star Wars movie. It contained the same themes we've come to expect from the original trilogy and I think that's a good thing. I like the fact that it tried to undo the damage done by TLJ. TLJ didn't feel like a Star Wars movie to me.  It felt like the moody, emo sister of a Star Wars movie. Apart from a really poor plot, and overt virtue-signaling, that was what was so jarring about TLJ. I see people complaining that this movie ruined the character arcs of TLJ. First, apart from Rey and Kylo, there weren't any left after TLJ. I cared so little for the main characters in TLJ that I thought I'd never want to see TROS. Second, ruining character arcs was TLJ's principal sin and trying to restore some of them was TROS's principal virtue. 

People can go two, very different ways on the fan service that TROS provides. Some say it's cheap. Others will say it makes for an enjoyable ride. I'm in the latter category. Let's assume there weren't real problems with TFA and TLJ. This sort of all-in, all-present ending movie is just the kind of movie I'd expect to finish off the Skywalker storyline. We all appreciated that about Endgame, probably because that's what we've come to expect from literature and movies that tie-off a big universe of plots and characters.  

Was it the best Star Wars movie? No. Did it contain some just-so stories or a deus ex machina or three? Yes. Still, I enjoyed it. I liked seeing an end to the story of the Skywalker family and its long, arduous battle against the Sith. That's what this movie was. It wasn't a story about Poe, Finn, Rose, and, to some extent, I can also say that it wasn't all about Rey either. That's what I wanted. I wanted a Skywalker movie. I wouldn't expect the final installment of the Harry Potter franchise to be about Ron or Hermione, nor would I want that."
"Managed to be even worse than Episode I.
Only good thing is John Williams music."
"Easily the worst movie in the entire saga. It entirely makes The Last Jedi unnecessary, despite what the writers may think. Instead of spending time continuing the story from where the previous movie left the characters and developing them further, this episode either ignores character arcs, or outright changes them. To make it worse, there's no character development of any kind because the characters are constantly feeding the audience exposition in order to get to a finale that is exactly like the original trilogy finale. This shouldn't be a surprise when a character is forcibly brought back only to be another character's method of redemption"
"There was no emotional impact, the editing was shoddy and the interconnection between scenes held together roughly with duct tape; there were so many plot holes involved due to trying to cover up 'The Last Jedi,' it was phenomenally criminal...and simply put, the entire SKYWALKER SAGA (the HEART and SOUL of the Star Wars storyline and franchise) was reduced to insignificant nothingness and wiped off the map. A true disgrace. 

If you like fast-pace storylines, visually stunning scenes, a lot of action, and interesting cinematography, then you're in for a treat. If not, don't waste your time."
"I thought this was a perfect end to the latest trilogy in the Star Wars saga. Full of non stop action and excitement,it was a feast for the eyes, as well as some heartfelt moments."
"Bad, predictable story. Very poor or nonexistent character development. Bad guys that seem tacked on rather than central to the story. Good guys, bad guys and seemingly unlimited resources that just appear out of nowhere. Surprise! not.
A sad so called conclusion to a once great universe that really died with the release of the somehow worse Ep VIII. Such a sad, sad waste."
This movie feels like it was written for children where the plot moves the characters to progress the storyline instead the other way around.  The logistics of the of the plot thread onm the final order makes no sense.  Only good thing about this movie is it's oversized budget to make the movie visually appealing.  The last scene of the movie kill the entire franchise.
"If you are expecting amazing action sequences and very good acting for a final farewell, then you will be fully satisfied of this very entertaining film. If you are looking to poke holes at all of the plot points, then you won't enjoy the movie."
The cinematic equivalent of taking a dump in your own fridge.
"Look, if you didn't want to make a Star Wars movie, then don't make a Star Wars movie.  There's plenty of other people who have better ideas."
Absolute rubbish..worse trilogy so far
Truly ruined George Lucas legacy.
A great arrangement of all the characters past present future in a combination of great action and violence.
If you haven't watch the original and prequel trilogy. You'll like it. If you understand the star wars universe lore. This movie broke all of it. Like the Last Jedi
"Aunque puede tener momentos gratos, es general es un desastre narrativo. ""Fan Service"" forzado y parches para recomponer los cambios que introdujo la película pasada."
"I can’t believe that Disney dove into this trilogy without a plan. TFA set up questions that still don’t have answers, TLJ was trash, and this movie is PROOF that they didn’t have a plan going into this. The pacing in this film is awful, the lightsaber fights ? forgettable, and whatever lore and rules were left in the Star Wars universe utterly abandoned. I remember when this universe had rules and I miss those days. SPOILERS from here on out. The plot of this movie was so convoluted and confusing. It seems that the characters only progress because of luck. Too much stuff is in this movie for the 16 hour period of time and half of it is unnecessary. Why is Lando in this movie? Why is Poe’s power ranger girlfriend in this movie? Why is Jannah in this movie? These people are unneeded; they clog up time that could be spent on fixing the pacing and answering questions. So Palpatine has returned in this movie with basically no explanation other than “The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some may consider to be unnatural”. Palpatine’s return is a huge slap in the face to everyone who ever cared about Star Wars, prequel fans and OT fans alike. It was Anakin’s/Vader’s destiny to throw Palpatine down that bottomless pit and then the Death Star EXPLODED with Palpatine in it. Bringing him back ruins literally everything in those six movies. Anakin was supposed to be the Chosen One and that was mentioned over and over in the prequels and the Clone Wars. Now it’s all pointless! ... And guess how Palps is defeated? Rey deflects lightning into his face. How are we supposed to believe he’s dead when he survived all the previous things in all the other movies? I was actually fine with this movie in the beginning, even though the Poe and Finn in the Falcon chase was utterly pointless because the movie wanted some action. The point where the movie really went downhill was when Lando showed up for no reason and disappeared. And then the stormtroopers flew and we heard “They fly now!” ... why are they surprised? C3PO has seen a ton of stuff and Finn used to be a stormtrooper, for crying out loud! They should know that jet packs exist! For some reason our heroes fall into quicksand and fall into a cave beneath. Is that how gravity works now? ...The moment that destroyed all the rules was when Rey force healed the snake/worm. It makes the movie feel like there’s no stakes because the force can magically heal people now (and resurrect them too, as seen later). Heck, in the Phantom Menace Qui-Gon DIED... why didn’t Obi-Wan just force heal him? And I don’t understand why Rey thought it was safe to attempt to heal it... then it makes the way out of the quicksand... For some reason Rey goes into the desert and stands out there. There’s no reason for her to do this. Then Kylo charges at her with his tie fighter/silencer ship. If he wants to kill her, he should use his guns. If he doesn’t want to kill her then he shouldn’t ram his tie fighter into her... what is character motivation? Rey does an impossible flip and DESTROYS his ship. It explodes and tumbled and BOY, THAT’S AN EXPLOSION. But both Kylo Ren AND the ship both survive. You heard me correctly. Kylo doesn’t have a scratch but you could say “the force”. But the ship was literally blown up on screen... and you see it perfectly together later in the movie. THEY DESTROY IT ON SCREEN AND THEN FORGET. And it’s the same ship, not a similar one because it has the way finder in it! WTH. It looks like Rey kills Chewie but he doesn’t die. Then later the gang gets on Ochi’s ship which still works somehow to see the merchandise and the power ranger. C3PO’s memory gets wiped but then is fine by the end of the movie because R2 had a replacement. It feels like nobody is in danger. There are so many stupid things in this movie. The Death Star was completely annihilated in ROTJ but somehow there are still remains of it. Kylo’s helmet was completely destroyed in TLJ but is easily fixed in this movie. Rey sails across a rough ocean and doesn’t die. Finn says that he has something to tell Rey but he never tells her. Hux is the spy, but the motivation makes no sense. Luke acts like TLJ never happened. Leia’s dialogue feels weird because she’s dead, and then when she dies in this movie it’s so strange. They should have killed her last movie. When Rey and Kylo finally team up against Palpatine, Kylo has a blaster but then it magically disappears because this movie doesn’t have an ounce of consistency. The finale rips off Endgame, and you are left wondering why the bad guys don’t just tilt the ships, and how Lando got so much backup. Palpatine doesn’t say anything cool except quote prequel lines. Rey defeats him easily. Why should we care? She’s way more powerful than everyone. She is literally shown levitating in this movie. When she dies, Kylo revives her, and then... they kiss. Their relationship in these movies is so toxic and awful and everyone groaned. Then he dies. He should’ve lived and Rey should’ve died, and the entire world would’ve been happier with that ending. At the end Rey buries Anakin’s lightsaber in SAND. She calls herself Rey Skywalker, and literally anything else would’ve been better. So in conclusion, what the hell. I suppose this is slightly better than TLJ, but wow, this movie is BAD and a huge insult to fans."
"Because of my low expectations, I was entertained. The Star Wars universe is so absorbing after all. But the return of the emperor, etc, that was such a bummer. Such lack of creativity. They could've made a better ending."
Great visuals without integrity. A lot of things should not happen in the movie.
Lacked all the nuance of Star Wars.
A few cool effects wrapped around a flat story and characters who exist solely as collections of quips.
A perfect ending to the Skywalker Saga. I absolutely loved it!
"In the previous movies, scenes lingered and deepened, so actors could work with what was happening and you could become part of the story. This one skipped between scenes too much. The ending also really bothered me. What happened to a commemoration or a story telling of what happened at the end. He was the partner significant character. What happened to his essence? Where was the chat with Luke, Han, Leia and Ben? Etc. It feels quite deflating. Finn also, the previous movies really allowed the actor to shine. He had little to work with and that was disappointing."
"Well, the production is done well. But all the takebacks of the Star Wars Galaxy is intelligence insulting. Oof!! Terrible story! Does too much taking-back and creating its own rules (which is trust shattering) to really be a respectable addition to the series, when it could've continued exploring and expanding the series while honoring what's been already established. smh"
"This was a great movie. Great story, great cast, great sets, and great action sequences. The best of the newest 3 for sure! It was nice to see the great nostalgic moments as well. Well executed!"
"WELL, as a star wars film; this was awful, nothing as bad as the last Jedi but nothing as good as the last Jedi, a preety forgetable movie"
I expected a lot more from a Star Wars movie.  Thoroughly disappointed. Waste of money as far as far as I'm concerned.
Very boring. What a waste of time. So predictable.
"Bloody awesome, had a bit of everything going for it."
Awesome. So much better than the last one.
"Jedi is obsoleted, please bring Yuuzhan Vong in, bring Thrawn back ."
The entire movie felt rushed with no clear idea of where it was going. Its definitely not worth buying. This is the only time where it feels good knowing this was the last movie and no more garbage is to come.
Terrible. Steaming horse shit has more appeal.
"After the dumpster fire that was The Last Jedi, I had little hope for this movie.  It's hard to maintain any tension in a trilogy when you kill off your primary antagonist in the second movie.  So needless to say I was expecting this movie to be epicly bad.  I was wrong.  I knew that in order to salvage this franchise some mental gymnastics was in order and digging up a long dead character was it,  it was my only complaint, but to be honest, I couldn't have thought of anything that would have done better.  The tension was high and I even thought the good guys might lose.  I have never been so glad to be wrong."
"The Rise of Skywalker had a lot of weight on its shoulders. Other than having to clean up the mess that was The Last Jedi, the movie was pretty good for what it was. It was a good fan service for all superfans of Star Wars, but my biggest issue is I left wanting more out of the franchise. I struggled with the fact that this movie ended a legendary series. It was good, but it wasn't enough."
Sooooooo bad. Just so bad. It was bad enough to make me like the original series less.
Decent ending to a terrible trilogy.
"My god, I don't even know where to start. This movie is basically JJ Abrams having a petty fight with Rian Johnson. This entire trilogy is just pathetic. This movie is clearly the worst of the trilogy. At least with Last Jedi, it had a theme. It wasn't all over the place, and it had a ""vision"". It knew what it wanted to be, it was just executed poorly. The same can't be said for TROS. It's just bland, and an absolute mess."
"Best SW of the last six, cohesive enough to be enjoyed, beautifully filmed and nicely acted (even Adam Driver seems finally at ease as Kylo Ren)"
"Weird, somewhat cool, totally unhinged"
"Incredible special effects, and amazing casting and set design. Worst plot ever. The more you think about it the less it makes sense. so far behind Lucas' original. Best to start with a 3 story treatment and  a narrative arc."
"I thought the final film (as of now) in the Star Wars saga was really good. I thought they tied everything together really well. I was surprised when I saw that they brought Darth Sidious and Lando back. I really liked the final scene, when Rey visited Luke’s childhood home from the original. It was really nostalgic."
"The movie is not bad but not great either. For a Star Wars film when compared to its predecessors, and for a story to end a saga, it is actually quite a let down."
This was such a disappointing movie to me. I grew up watch Star Wars. While the fight scenes were awesome. The story was garbage.
That is absolutely the worst star wars film out of all 9
We need a perfect ending like Endgame.
This final chapter is like running over a kids beloved dog and then thinking you can make up for it by giving them an ice cream.
JJ did his best with what he was given thanks to TLJ.
"Not sure why the ratings are low, it was a very good movie! Worth watching. Action was great, acting was awesome."
Much better than I thought. I find peace ;)
"7, 8 and 9 are an insult to everything that George Lucas did. 8, for example, is being taught in film schools as an example of what not to do when making a film. the plot of the three films is radically inconsistent."
"Was this movie made in a huge hurry? Did they not have time to work out the script and dialogue so that everything people say doesn't sound stupid? And how did the actors all downgrade in their acting abilities?

This conclusive episode is such an incredible disappointment, and it really feels like they just made a cheap story just because they knew they're going to make buckets of money off of the movie and franchise regardless of how it turns out."
A fun entry into the Star Wars universe!
The movie should have been called Star Wars: The Rise of the Dead. Dead characters keep coming back until Skywalker is omnipotent. I enjoyed the special effects and the action scenes.
Just one of the weakest Star Wars movies ever. They could have had a way better plot then the one they came up with. Mostly I just feel no one tried their hardest! Definitely worse than Cats that came out the same day! At least that movie tried!
"The third instalment was always going to have a tough time, I was hoping that they would have learned from their mistakes but I guess not. Turn your brain off and just get through it."
"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. 
They should have fired the screenwriters. Actually they should have made them pay for the cost of the entire production.
I want my money back."
"Terrible. Unfortunately they tried desperately to fix what they screwed up with the Last Jedi. I’m doing so, they rushed to undo the sins of the past and instead it became a jumbled mess. So disappointing more than anything. It seemed like nothing was thought out. No ideas were allowed to naturally unfold and characters made such unrealistic decisions, gestures, and conversations with other characters. It was almost too corny. Even for a Star Wars film."
"It was obvious the last 3 films weren't written together as a trilogy, I will not be watching anything from Abrams, Kennedy or Johnson and I hope they don't touch anymore beloved franchises.  How ridiculously written that the emperor can strike down a whole fleet with just his powers.  Yoda is one of the strongest jedis and there is no way he can do anything close to what the emperor did in the Rise of Skywalker.  The move felt too rushed and the force was not treated like anything close to the previous movies.  Too bad too since the actors and actresses did a good job for what they were given, the directors and the screenwriting however were just so poor in understanding a big franchise.  One wonders why Disney picked these people, anyone else even a new director probably could have done better."
"Loved it! Saw it 3 times in the theater and forced myself to wait for the blu-ray. So much better than TLJ, so relieved. Thanks J.J. Wrapped up the saga very well even if many details went unexplained due to time constraints. I would have preferred a longer movie or parts 1 and 2, but am very happy to have another SW movie to enjoy."
I'm a big Star wars fan ever since I was a kid and this movie just discredit the other films and it didn't make sense compared to the other films yes it had good action scenes but this was a forgettable movie
"Very disappointed.....

All the writing, production, quality actors trying to put 100% into a script that may have been okay for a ""B"" class movie at best. That is all I can say. took a great franchise with a huge fan base, and ended an epic adventure that spanned decades with a ... meh..."
"This is in no way a perfect movie. It's also not a perfect Star Wars movie. However, this movie is way better than the Last Jedi. The Last Jedi was an absolute disgrace made by a man who had zero respect for the original movies.  Anyway, The Rise Of Skywalker is a fun movie that wraps up the saga in a mostly satisfying way."
The movie was amazing. Could've been better but it was amazing!!!!
"While it would've been extremely hard to be a worse movie than the last Jedi, this didn't do much to get me excited. The lightsaber combat especially was lackluster, they moved slow and with big movements, I understand them doing that for episode 7 but, they have supposedly been training and still Rey and Kylo suck at fighting. The story in general was unimpressive and palpatine was only there to get people to spend money at the theater. I've been a life long fan of star wars and it has pained me to see Disney ruin it so completely."
"awfull, terrible, total waste of my time"
"Very bland, I found myself bored throughout the film. Trying to appease old star wars fans. Had its cool moments and nice visuals but in the end lacks a lot in my opinion. The finale was entertaining and the only memorable moment, altough it made me scratch my head in confusion because of the characters relation and interaction."
Script sucked. What a disgrace to the Star Wars name.
"They were horrible, even if I buy into that Hans is killed by his son, ok. But, Mom who has the same powers as Luke never feels what is going on inside her son ? Nor does his uncle Luke has no credibility. If we consider, Luke is the last Jedi standing, we would see as Yoda did a progression of a prodigy to pass the torch or knowledge to. Instead we see an angry Hobo, ( as my friend in England called him ) , just evaporate into dust. Again he does not appear even as a specter as his mentors did, again not connecting the story lines. He should have taken her Light Saber and shown his, THAT should have had the sentinel yellow light. It was not there, the writes failed to make a connection of transference of power, training , teaching of Jedi philosophy to this new Jedi. A pissed off , scared Sky walker just turns to dust, suggest that the light was and is weaker than the darkness, therefore the light is lost already. That evil has more ways to with than the enlightened good just again loses contact. Look, if you are trying to rip off the bile don't forget Jesus made it clear, just using his name of his fathers immediately cause the demons to be cast out and the light overwhelms and burns out the darkness. So, what are we left with, Hans is killed by his son, Mom and brother do  not feel how screwed up the kid is and he runs off to be a villain and somehow while dying gets his mothers soul, which she could have shared with him while she was alive, HAD she , trained, studies or even worked with her brother to understand and master the powers she allegedly was born with. To say bad, dissapointed, poor story telling . Total garbage to this great Saga is an  understatement."
"Extremamente carregado, muitas pontas para serem amarradas que foram deixados para apenas um filme , além de escolhas horríveis e revelações de parentesco sem nenhum sentido. A única coisa que se salva são os efeitos especiais impecáveis como sempre."
"Spoiler Alert!

The worst scenario ever. Everyone is happy, almost nobody died, and they even kissed each other. Even though, the most powerful fleet consisted from maybe tousand destroyers was against some stuck of bad fighters."
"I felt that the writers and directors were not sure where to go with this story or the characters, and so we got a over the top story ending and some boring character interactions.

Sadly, I think that a lot of films end up like this with a lot at stake (big budget) and too many cooks in the kitchen."
Really great ending to the franchise.
"So, the Rey trilogy comes to an end. Fortunately, we had some sparks from the nostalgic essence brought by George Lucas' first trilogy with the iconic characters such as Luke, Han Solo, and our favorite droids, but never fulfilled.
The Rise of Skywalker lacks a deeper unique story, which mostly makes us feel like if we were watching the Last Jedi remake with a weird twist involving the new characters. The special effects obviously have improved through the years making this movie visually richer. but having that in mind this should make a world of difference for the producer's story by making fans dive into a more original Star Wars movie."
"What can you say. Saw the original as a kid and they were great. Now its come down to this. SW8 was terrible. Only watched this because my friend bought it for some reason and let me borrow it. Same continued stupid plot as 8. Not going to discuss most of the plot, but really, the plot involving Palpatine, Really? I won't give this a 1 just to be a Debbie Downer. Good special effect and most of the actors hold the line. Its just the plot thats so far fetched that I'm surprised Vader didn't show to kill everybody to save us all from any future movies of this franchise."
"Honestly I thought I was very good, more coherent than a lot of people say. I liked how it corrected a lot of the Rian Johnson retcons. I can't see why it has so many haters. 
  The only issue I have with it is that it's a Star Wars movie and it's really all based in low altitude. 😂 lol"
Another pice of garbage from Disney
I enjoyed it both times I went to see it.
Holy fucking crap that was awful
Worse than the last jedi. The only reason that this gets a review is because of Mark Hamill
"Disappointing movie, I expected something better for the ""conclusion"" of this saga"
"I would say the movie is garbage, but that would be too kind.  It is aggressively nonsensical, as if it were an experiment in how much preposterous bs could be shown in a theater before audiences rioted."
"No amount of special effects can hide the fact that this is a retelling of Return Of The Jedi with some Empire Strikes Back thrown in for good measure. Its just not that original. The story goes at such a fast pace, with so much full-on action that you don't really get a chance to settle into the film. If you are a Star Wars fan you will watch it and enjoy it, but it's no classic which would stand up on it's own merit."
Perfeito. Sou apaixonado por Star Wars e adorei a volta d(spoiler)
"As a stand alone film, it isn't bad, unfortunately it isn't really a stand alone film. It's the end of saga, and sadly I don't know if anyone could have ended in a manner befitting the franchise's impact on cinema. Nothing about it is bad, but then again, nothing about it is really all that stellar. It makes the prequel nearly irrelevant."
"This movie was filled with nuggets of everything we love about this saga.  Rey was badass, full of heart and her battles with Kylo Ren epic."
Rey is a shining example to young women everywhere to be the hero of your own story and not the side piece to somebody else's. Loved her and this trilogy!
"simply awful, just like previous two, one of the worst trilogies around."
"This is exactly the kind of movie that makes me wonder why anyone would listen to critics.  Awesome movie, this coming from a lifetime (born in ‘77, yeah same year) MASSIVE fan.  Seems like these ""critics"" are so stuffed full of themselves that they can't appreciate a good Star Wars movie."
Action packed. A great close to the Skywalker Saga and much better than some rather pedantic fans are saying.  Looking forward very much to the next saga
Lazy storyline. It was essentially a remake of return of the Jedi.  The visual effects were cool. Lame ending too.
"This movie was a complete pile of garbage. Disney has done a horrible job managing these new Star Wars films. When they purchased Star Wars from George Lucas, Star Wars was like a goose capable of laying golden eggs. If they had managed this film series correctly, they would be putting out golden eggs for movies. Instead they killed the goose and are putting out crap like this film and The Last Jedi which has driven most of the fans away."
"There was ofc lots of horrible acting, but that was no surprise. A disappointment as a movie, but also no surprise was all the throw backs it included. It tried to sum up so much it crumpled under the weight. I felt The Rise of Skywalker tried too hard to please everybody, and thus ended up pleasing nobody (well some idiots lol).

The entire new series was not only made up of little original material, but what was original was VERY predictable, and practically painful to watch."
What a wasted opportunity. Fanfic could do much better.
"You know. If you want a story just shy of the Justice League movie on plot, character development, and overall direction with enough overdone effects work to surpass every Star Wars franchise combined then THIS is your movie. Overblown on its' own ego. So happy this saga is over."
Wasn't even funny bad. Just cringy bad.
The story looked like a train-wreck.  Guess the good part is it finally over with.
"As a Star Wars fan, I am excited to see the Skywalker storyline come to an end and look forward to new adventures in the future."
"I had read the reviews and articles, and decided not to go see this movie when it came out. Just finished watching this and wow. Just simply wow.

Not being versed as a screenwriter, director, producer or any of the hundreds of occupations needed to make this kind of movie I am honestly amazed at how something this bad got made as the final Star Wars movie of the whole saga.

Nothing makes sense in this movie. The motives, the arc, the dialog, the plotdevices. None of it works. 

The only redeming things for me were the set designs and the Sith throne room.

This was a two hours and a half wasted."
"I liked, but I would like to see the J.J. Abrams cut of the film."
"This movie was poorly made and it shows. It adds so much to the trilogy trying to smash everything into one movie which results in the jarringly fast pacing. This feels like JJ Abrams just undid everything Rian Johnson did in The Last Jedi, and then just remade the entire last two movies of the trilogy. This is honestly more like a video game campaign story then a movie. The reveal of Palpatine being alive is so forced and so sudden. The plot points are forced and the final battle is just a direct copy of avengers: endgame. I really feel like Rose Tico and Finn were wasted characters and Poe just turned into an asshole for some reason. I did really like that scene when Han Solo confronts Ben; that was honestly beautiful. I also liked Babu Frik an insane amount, but besides that, this movie is so dissapointing."
"Rushed, unfinished and with little if any thought behind the script."
"The worst Star Wars that they could produce. No consistency, no plot, no suspense! meaningless dialogue and pointless scenes. It makes the prequels look descent...."
"I'm one of the few that enjoyed the curve ball Rian Johnson threw with The Last Jedi. Although it would have been nice to see J.J. Abrams make the occasional bold move, in The Rise Of Skywalker he unstitches and resews plot points from the predecessor. The pacing in the first act feels rushed and could possibly be an entry in to the saga on its own. However, it serves as a perfect ending for the Disney trilogy."
"The fact that Insidious has a higher rating than this Star Wars movie tells you everything you need to know about how reviews often reflect people's expectations more than the actual quality of a movie. This addition to the franchise is decent and entertaining, as one would expect from J.J. Abrams. That it is rated lower than one of THE WORST movies ever made -- Insidious -- is beyond me, but clearly reflected in the difference between the audience score and the reviewer score. I would consider the audience rating when deciding whether to see this or not."
"So, having finally gotten round to reviewing this, it has gone down dramatically in score since first walking out of the cinema. While as a single, standalone Star Wars movie I would easily give it four, maybe even four and a half stars, after seeing it again and judging it against the rest of the sequal trilogy, it has dipped substantially. It is still a very enjoyable, very well acted and made film with incredible action sequences and an uplifting ending. However, it is a jumbled mess of a movie trying to please the ones pissed off by its (admittedly better) predecessor, TLJ. The worst of the three sequals just from a lack of wasted potential, trying to damage control and shoehorn in as many cheep nostalgia references as possible to hide the disservice it does to any character that isn't Rey or Kylo. But, after all of the negativity, props to the incredible performances of both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, and for making it an overall sti fun movie."
"As far as a plot and script goes, it feels like I was watching something a film student put together on the last Sunday evening of the semester after spending the rest of the school year on a bender. ""I didn't have enough time to get it done."" Abrams essentially transformed all the efforts, accomplishments and sacrifices of the previous films' characters into an abyss of null and void. They died and sacrificed for nothing, ""watch my movie, those were a waste of your time,"" says JJ. If this was anything other than a Star Wars movie, I would have walked out on it about half way through, I really wish I never walked in on it. Special effects were great, it shows how the craft has matured over the years, that's it! Blown opportunities for character development, arc or making a logical movie. Too much fanboy ingratiation, while still leaving loose ends unfinished. What a shame. I've been a Star Wars fan since the 70s and have endured mostly sub-par movies, but I keep coming back because it's a great universe of possibilities, but for some reason no one has been able to get it right since the 80s. This latest trilogy started without originality; then it was blamed for becoming too original by all the fanboys; now it fights to get back to mediocrity and recycling old SW nostalgia but settles on the absurd. This is THE WORST Star Wars movie ever, and I didn't like any of the green screen prequels, but would gladly watch the Phantom Menace over this any day. I might even watch the Holiday Special before watching this again. I feel like I need to apologize to George Lucas for saying anything bad about the prequels because they look like masterpieces compared to what this latest trilogy became. The Force Wakes Up was forgiven for being unoriginal, but we were glad to have SW back. Last Jedi was going in a new direction and that was ok as long as they could pull it all together. There were still major problems with it, but I was willing to go along if they could fit it into the arc of SW, but no, JJ had to try to hit the reset button and work as a customer service rep trying to make the fanboys all happy by addressing every complaint right down to Chewbacca getting his ""long-deserved"" medal which is beyond stupid. Our moans during the movie turned into laughter at the embarrassment of this steaming pile by the end. Why can't we get a good writer/director for this franchise? It will be the first SW movie I won't have in my personal collection."
"The fact that thus film has the audience score that it does is proof that society has absolutely no standards when it comes to entertainment. 

This film was flaming hot garbage. A failed attempt at nostalgia and was as empty units storytelling as it was intellectually. This film felt like a half baked mess that simply included throwbacks to the original trilogy simply for the sake of winning older fans over in the Hope's that they would oversee how vapid the entire experience was. 

There is absolutely nothing memorable about the characters, plot, story mechanics, or even the visuals. It felt more like a desperate attempt to recapture Return of the Jedi than its own individual and unique film. Instead, it caters to the low hanging fruit.

If you enjoyed this, then I can only assume your a simpleton and an idiot with the IQ of an average houseplant. Yes, you're entitled to your opinion, but your opinion is wrong."
"Creo que esta película que debió ser la mejor es la que menos funciona en la ultima trilogía. Los personajes no terminan de crecer, no evolucionan, magnifican la historia que en si no se siente magnifica en absoluto. Sacan bajo la manga personajes muertos, apelan a la nostalgia desde un mal enfoque. Aun así los efectos la salvan y algunos cierres que quedaron bien."
"""Twas brillig, and the slithy toves"" is how begins a poem that makes more sense that this saga finale. Scenes are not setup and you are thrown around different destinations, action and plot points causing massive confusion from the very beginning and in such a way you lose interest quickly and just want this to be over."
"Wow. The more I think about this film, the more I realize how horrible it actually was. The more I think about this film, the more I appreciate The Last Jedi. When I originally went into this movie, I had very low expectations because of the reviews I saw, but after I had seen it for myself, I was pretty impressed. With that to say, it has now been about three months since I've seen this movie and I've had time to digest it some more and I can confirm that my opinions about it have definitely changed. Sure there were a moments in there that were a nice nod to die-hard fans but in all honesty, those were the only good parts. This movie was rushed and completely meant to retcon the events of The Last Jedi. The character arcs were sloppy (with the acception of Ben Solo), the storyline was not well thought out, a lot of characters and things were just crammed in there and we didn't have any context about them or have time to get any context about them. I really could go on and on with the flaws of this movie but this review would be much longer. I grew up having Star Wars be my #1 most favorite movie franchise, but after this disaster of a trilogy that Disney botched so horribly and ruined for a lot of die-hard fans, it no longer is. I'm going to have to give that honor to the MCU. Considering their worst movie out of 23 of them was one that really wasn't all that bad; Thor: The Dark World. Honestly, if you ask me, I don't think it was that hard to develop a successful trilogy and a good conclusion to the legendary Skywalker saga. Disney has done a tremendous job on movies in the past as everyone obviously knows (they've even created a theme park after their movies) and I feel like with this trilogy they had one job. JUST ONE JOB and they couldn't even get that right. I guess we'll have to wait for the Mandalorian or future Star Wars movies to do the trick. Although it didn't end how I wanted it to, I do have to give credit to this franchise for basically being my entire childhood. So Star Wars, thank you for the memories. We've had a lot of highs and lows but mostly highs and for that, I am very grateful."
"(SPOILERS) This movie is a prime example of disney ruining everything they buy the rights to. This movie makes no sense logically. As a movie in general, it's too rushed and throws everything at your face in order to cram the crummy characters' plot lines into the movie. Emperor Palpatine felt thrown in because they killed off Snoke in a stupid way in episode 8. Rey being a descendant of Palpatine was a decent twist, but felt as if the writers just thought of it while writing the script of episode 9 because they didn't know in the last 2 movies. As a Star Wars movie, it is obvious that George Lucas had  nothing to do with this movie. It makes no sense in the Star Wars universe at all. George Lucas' vision for his movies have been thrown in Disney's trash can and I, along with many others, hate to see it. I was optimistic with Episode 7, which gave this disney trilogy a lot of potential, but this movie along with episode 8 made me disregard Disney's Star Wars movies as canon. If you want to watch Star Wars, watch episodes 1-6."
"I'm still wondering about some plot holes, otherwise it was a fun watch."
Laughably bad. Who approved the script? Jeez. Absolutely terrible. Fan theories written by middle school kids could have been better.
"Hilariously bad, but also boring. And everything was dumb. So so dumb. Frustratingly dumb. Written terribly, pacing is jarring, the tone is wrong, the comedy is cringe, and the dialogue is awful. Also the stupid callbacks and unsubtle winks were lame. Graphics ranged from decent to outdated videogame. The tension was manufactured, and the characters were inconsistent. Palpy was enjoyable of course, until he went out like a sucker. It all lead up to a disappointing climax."
"Repeat viewings definitely helped me appreciate this movie more.  I loved Force Awakens and remember seeing Last Jedi and wondering why I didn't latch onto it.  Waiting two years to see Luke pitch the lightsaber over the edge was a real letdown.  This movie definitely tries to fix a lot of plot points I didn't care for in Jedi.  As a few reviews probably mention...this would have worked better as two films.  However if you don't think too hard about the logic of the story and sit back to enjoy...it's definitely a fun time.  A lot of people my age who grew up with the original trilogy (I was born in ‘77) give this round of movies a hard time.  It won't ruin your childhood...and yeah it's pretty clear Disney didn't have a set game plan (or one from  Awakens to Jedi), but it comes to a close with some great effects and crowd pleasing battles.  Their are some obvious throw backs to keep viewers of the older films entertained and more than a few plot points you may pick apart.  However if you want to sit back and see the new trilogy come to a decent close...I think it's done in a more than partially entertaining way.  A fun time...wish they'd do another one but we have Mandalorian in the meantime."
This Sucked because it was just Fanservice. none of it made sense
this is terrible. I am very sorry that Disney ruined this story
"This is definitely the best movie of the sequel trilogy. I love this movie a lot. I know that some of the critics aren't a fan of this, but I really do enjoyed this movie. This movie helped me like the sequel trilogy even more. I really like the story to this movie. The main issue with this movie is that every star destroyer is a Death Star, and that there's thousands of them which didn't make sense as much."
Terribly disjointed. Tons of contradiction with itself and the two previous films. Nice special effects but still garbage.
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker isn't what the greatest sci-fi franchise deserves. But given the context, it deserves a passing grade."
"So, Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is here, and everyone is hating on it. But why?
Well, the movie does have it's problems. The story is messy, and there are quite a few things to question. While there are bad things, there are also good things. I personally thought The Last Jedi was okay, but not great. I think haters of The Last Jedi will probably enjoy this movie, but Last Jedi lovers will hate this movie. This conclusion to the Skywalker saga may not be too satisfying, but it is enjoyable. Final Verdict: 6/10"
"The Last Jedi: “Well, at least I hold the title of being the worst Star Wars film ever.” Rise of Skywalker: “Hold my blue milk!”"
It felt like the movie was going super fast one scene there at the base and then the next their flying in the Millennium Falcon.I don’t see the point of even have Rose Tico as a character at all if you are going to give her such a small part in this film but giver her such a BIG part in the last movie.
"After this and the last one from the star wars saga, i think The Phantom Menace has serious competition for the worst part în a movie franchise. And, dear Disney, even if you probably are the biggest player în movie industry, you can t match the imagination and vision of Luca..Star Wars is not for you...for me Star Wars ended before you made the new trilogy..."
My all time favorite Star Wars film EVER!
"If it isn't destroying what The Last Jedi built up, it is destroying Star Wars Lore in general. Nothing makes sense, nothing works, and it could have worked! But it was a fanfic of disaster!"
"What a load of stinky cheese. This movie is better suited for 5-8 year olds. Bad story, bad fight choreography, just overall mediocrity. The only thing it had going for the movie was that it was kind of pretty( special effects and some scenery. What at your own peril."
"You expect way more for the last chapter of the prominent Star Wars but you end up with a bad written scenario, a rushed one where apparently Abrams is just ""doing his job"". It was a HUGE deception."
Was difficult to find something I didn't hate in every 5 minute block.
"Very week story structure which doesn't even recognize the events of the mess the the last Jedi was. No consistency whatsoever with the story changing what we knew about the original trilogy with rey being the strongest Jedi ever (even though she trained mostly alone) with godly powers. The other main characters were almost useless and the villain made no sense wiping Anakin's sacrifice in the return of the Jedi. If you only watch this trilogy and didn't really care about thinking about what is happening it probably won't bother you that much and you will be able to enjoy the movie, but for SW fans it is just a disappointment. To resume, from 1 to 10:
Story: 3- a real mess. The force is magic sent by god to the only person in the entire universe capable of healing deadly wounds (even kylo ren died for saving Rey). Side characters being there or not wouldn't change anything since palpatine could destroy everything with his lightning powers and Rey for some reason was able to reflect it... even though GOD DAMN DARTH VADER died from it in order to kill palpatine which should be dead anyway.
Visuals: 9- Only good part
Characters: 2- don't know almost anything about them and what we know happens off-screen and we just have to accept that the 3 main characters are best friends just because. 
As a stand-alone movie for casual movie goers: 6- its not a bad time...
For fans and as a part of not only a trilogy but a also a 9 movie story: 2- its bad... Prequels were bad but at least the story was consistent. The sequels and the rise of Skywalker are just a mess"
A very good end to the saga.
"good but the got the name of the pathfinder thingie got wrong, its name is suppose to be a holocron"
The worst ending possible for a great movie franchise. This and Endgame are both splitting images of each other and both of them suck
"Not only the worst Star Wars movie but quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot comes from nowhere, in no way is there any link to the previous films in the trilogy and then the plot goes nowhere as well. Every reveal is hollow and evidently just aiming to tug at the low hanging balls of nostalgia. Bloated fan service mess than just isn't Star Wars."
Most enjoyable star wars movie from start to finish made for me. Rey saying she is a Skywalker at the end was cringe but easy the most fun I've had with any of the star wars movies.
Bloody EPIC! YAAAAAAS!!!
This movie proved to me that the Sequel Trilogy is vastly inferior to the Legends Continuity because at least Legends didn't betray their original source material.
"very very shallow
good for kids, small kids"
"While this movie was in no way perfect, I felt it did everything it needed to perfectly.  While I'm sure it had its share of plot holes, it really did a great job of closing up some of the more serious holes created by the previous film and if you've made it this far in the franchise, I think you owe it to yourself to give this one a watch.  You never know till you try and this one made me a believer again."
"Dispite the length, this felt like the absolute shortest Star Wars film I've ever watched. Too much nostalgic moments, and not enough of progression. I guess the Star Wars we've come to know and love has been hashed way too much. I look forward to a totally new direction."
"Surprisingly, Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker ties up many loose ends and kind of repairs the sloppy horrible everything done by director Rian Johnson. Star Wars 9 actually left me somewhat satisfied with the Saga. I hated Star Wars 8 very much, I mean really hated it! Star Wars 7 had several problems too but alas 9 actually left me not hating the series so much. I won't give anything away but if you saw 8 and pretty much-hated everything star wars after seeing that pile of crap converted to film then you may actually be somewhat happy to see this film. I'll just leave it at that, Star Wars 9 is worth seeing."
"stuped, it was a waste of time. It lacks everything that a Star War movie should have"
this movie is amazing
I guess new Star Wars films are not for me or maybe they are objectively boring.
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination, but concludes this beloved saga with fan-focused devotion."
"Man, this was bad. The worst of them all. Not even disappointed anymore.. it was expected..."
Feels a bit rushed at points but is overall awesome!
"A satisfying, thrilling and very exciting conclusion to a beloved saga. Not sure what else could have been done that would keep people happy. It's like when The Last Jedi came out loads of people whined about it so much and so it's obvious that JJ Abrams tried you counteract that. Then he gets slayed for ‘pandering to fans nostalgia'. We are truly living in a world where people just love to complain. Just enjoy the movie or don't - everyone these days thinks they're a movie critic!"
un final muy épico para esta gran franquicia
"Well, if it was a B series movie with plenty of money it should be great, but all show inside has no sens in the saga.
Look like a quick made movies with no scenario and so many insconstancy with the rest of the saga and the rules of the force and Star wars universes.
Not seing it keep the magic intact, seing it makes you vomit. I hope that Disney never do such a disaster again."
"Just one contrived, sappy scene after another. Terribly predictable, every seen feels telegraphed and forced."
"There was talk of fixing the damage TLJ did to Luke's character.  Instead we got a 2 mins in a cameo scene.

This was not even a movie.  Just characters chasing mcguffins that lead to next mcguffin, that finally leads to palpatine for last half hour

The ending was as bad as it gets
Tlj did more disrespect to star wars.....but this was a way worse film.
Star wars is permanently damaged"
"Due to the lack of popper build ups, the payoffs completely fall on their face rendering the entire thing emotionless.

The plot is just a macguffin to find a macguffin to kill an evil guy that has no reason to even exist. Additionally, many of the plot elements are just contrived, often to no benefit.

At least the trilogy is over."
Another garbage Disney twist ...
"The better movie of the trilogy. Sure, it was the same old formula, and the twists were obvious, but at least it's over. Beyond that, the cinematography and score were beautiful; the acting & dialogue were much improved as well!"
"Entertaining, but cheesy at times. Too many hinted at love triangles that would’ve been better left out"
"Possibly a bit too fast paced but an excellent conclusion. Honestly, it has to have been hell trying to correct the massive blunder which was The Last Jedi"
"Очень странный сюжет, не логическое поведение персонажей. Не достойный финал саги. Единственные плюсы это отличные спецэффекты и боевка."
While the quality and graphics of this movie are spectacular. The story not only falls flat to make you feel something but rather destroys itself. Even if you judge this movie as a stand alone you can find yourself pointing out so many issues on how the story progresses. The movie fails in all fronts except design and graphical visuals. Every character action will leave you feeling annoyed or bored.
The only interesting things in the movie are the vissual effects and the last battle
"I truly hope the Skywalker saga is dead, this was the worst of the 3 after E6. It's time to focus on stand alones or slightly overlapped stories."
It's not even a movie. It's a string of cliches.
"See I knew this would happen. Last Jedi messed around with the formula so much that following in from it was never gonna be anything but a muddled mess. R2D2 was massively underused and I think that's an embarrassment, C3PO got his moment s to shine finally though so happy for that. The new characters I still don't care about at all. Classy way to deal with Carrie fisher passing all in all. Daisy Ridley is great but Rey is still mostly boring and badly written. And the emperor..... what on earth was all that about. All in all I'm severely non shocked by how the movie turned out but still sad"
"This movie is over hated on. Sure, some moments are a little bad. The first act of the movie has a lot of pacing issues, and it would have been better as a three hour cut. Despite the problems, this is my favorite Star Wars movie.

*SPOILERS*
Bringing Palpatine back felt weird at first, but it makes sense having him as the big bad. The Reylo kiss felt awkward and unnecessarily added. The battle above Exegol felt very epic."
"A result of a movie where at least half of it nothing important happened (Last Jedi). This movie felt rushed and stuffed full off scenes where no one plot point flowed into the next. Nevermind all the bits of the movie that were done for the sake of a twist or to be cinematic. I'm generally good at enjoying even a movie that's been panned (ignoring plots holes at times as well as ham-handed trope inclusion), but this had me checking my watch several times. We all know episodes vii-ix were created more to make money than to tell a story, but Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker made it obvious past the point of enjoyment."
It's not perfect but it definitely corrects some blunders made by the previous installment.
"Disney really dug their claws into this movie. Big decisions were made for no real reason other than to shock the audience. Star Wars has changed so much over the years it's unnerving. Rey's character growth was stunted by her origin reveal, while other characters were either reduced to minor roles or narratively ignored. It was all flash and no bang."
"Star Wars Episode 9 focuses heavily on bombastic action and exagerated fanservice instead of a compeling story and a coherent narrative, which ultimately results in a dissapointing movie and the worst of the Skywalker Saga."
It was alright but bring back Palpatine was just stupid
"First of all I want to make it clear that I am a star wars fan, but of those who are not against the new stories, I loved rebels, rogue one is very good and they have only defended themselves although tabien is a little lazy.

But this last trilogy is FATAL and this last movie is ABOMINABLE.
He leaves more questions than answers, he says goodbye to so many wonderful characters and in such bad ways that they are sad.

If I start to say everything that is wrong I honestly never end.
But let's talk about the most ridiculous:
-Armitage hux spy? his reasons, I don't want kylo ren to win !! what??
-Ray, she had enough of a little training to become almost a goddess of force who could have become empress !! osea sidius had to learn for years and she just woke up one day and is the greatest thing that has happened to her by force, she controls minds, throws lightning bolts, she has a super sixth Jedi sense and she has HEALING POWERS, she only needs to throw laser your eyes and freeze with your breath
-kylo ren osea how many times he was asked to be good suddenly he loses against ray his han appears, that nobody tells us where he comes from or if he is not a ghost in the force, but he appears and convinces him to become good, so just 3 minutes and zaz is good, says dad and throws his red saber
- The emperor bone this dude is suddenly dying and what a coincidence two super powerful jedis arrive, but that in front of a dying sith they cannot be more than insects and apart from what coincidence he can take life from them so he absorbs their energy and does everything powerful and begins to throw rays TO THE SKY, which is not the most surprising if not that with its rays it begins to destroy ALL of its enemies, but when those rays that brought down my ships are focused on ray for all rays with its saber, so WHAT? oh and so the WORST ENEMY SITH dies, the most evil and powerful dude, with his rays bounced by a saber -.-, so suddenly he is gone and the war and everything is over !!
BUM! Everyone happy; well less ben because he sacrifices himself to save ray and there with the death of ben the SKYWALKERs end there ah well but they do not end because ray decides not to be a palpatine, so just by his desire he says I am SKYWALKER then he dies lineage but does not die.

I'm sorry but I must say it:
GARBAGE ALL THE FILM IS GARBAGE"
"I loved it! What do you exactly expect from a Star Wars movie? This is no Shakespeare, we are talking about Space Opera. The picture was lovely, they give their most in order to entertain us. Oh BTW: I loved as well TLJ but that is for another post."
"I've never expected less from Disney, but they still surprised me."
"TROS could actually be better than this. I was expecting a lot more about this movie but I get absolutely disappointed. I loved some scenes tho but I was expecting more knowing that was the end of an incredible saga. 

Also, feel proud of daisy and adam, and all the incredible actors, they worked hard and did a good job :)"
"If Jumanji can fetch a freakin' 71% fresh.. Than Rise of Skywalker would realistically be scored about 1001%.
It's that good"
This movie vastly disappointed me... there’s nothing bold or new here
This movie is just bad in every possible way - major disappointment.
"Good Star Wars movie, moves at break neck pace. Kylo Ren & Rey are the best parts and moments in the movie. For what the movie gave me it's a good send off to the new trilogy"
"This is an enjoyable film and rounds the saga up fine! The film's biggest downfall is that it had to follow and fix the issue's from The Last Jedi, and JJ Abrams does the best he can with the limited room he had to take this movie in. 
It keeps you on your toes, it's fun to watch, there are some really cool moments and scene's in it and the big twist was something I (or I think most people) did not see coming, but was pulled off so well. 
The movie advances along very quickly, and would have been much better if it was split into two movies (although it would have meant for a quadrilogy out of Star Wars fashion, it would have done justice to the series), meaning it could have explored certain aspects more without rushing, given chance to have more grounding and better direction of the movie and could have developed characters and their stories more so. 
It was enjoyable to watch and a good time, other than over-use of lightning effects which made parts hard to watch at times, it was much better than it's predecessor (TLJ) and made for an enjoyable end to the saga. Not great, but good and enjoyable for what it had to go on after The Last Jedi."
"Una película mehhh, que pudo estar mucho mejor si se respetaba lo ya escrito en el episodio anterior, siendo un Fanfic de 2 horas, con algunos buenos momentos, pero una narrativa horrible y un final seco, con algunos personajes mal desarrollados, ignorando la película anterior la cual estuvo mil veces mejor, 6,8/10😒"
Trash. It’s like they have superpowers but don’t use them. It makes no sense.
"Wow, I would have never thought I might miss the prequels. But here we are.

What a sad mishmash of forced nostalgia and predictability."
"Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time round. The filmmakers had the unenviable task of rescuing a story wrecked by a horrendous previous instalment and untimely death of a key cast member, and I think they did a decent job. Without being a great movie, The Rise of Skywalker (and The Mandalorian) nevertheless brings back a sense of dignity to the overall Disney canon. RIP Carrie Fisher."
"They basically throw away the story set up by the previous two films and create a wholly unrelated story. What was the point of bringing back Palpatine? In the end, it doesn't matter and nothing changed. Yeah, the so called fans and audiences like you are making Star Wars into a turd. And Star Wars, stop redeeming your villains. It get cliched fast."
Made for a mass of peopple. Just not for me. Don't wanna see Star Wors movie for some time now. :(
"Not Satisfying, the plot still had some unexpected twists and turns but the cheesy dialogues leave a lot to be desired. The acting was mediocre, felt like this was the weakest installment in this series spanning the nine films."
"Great movie the best way to end the trilogy of trilogys. If you're a true star wars fan you'll love it because it's STAR WARS and not to mention it ties everything together nicely with a lot of action, drama, and excitement. If you're not a star wars fan weird place to start but I'm sure you will like it if not miss 8 films worth of back story is much of a problem for you."
"Aside from the production values, the movie doesn't offer that much. I'm so relieved I'm not a SW fan, it's a disjointed and underwhelming end to this saga, nothing pays off."
"If the movie wasn't so crunched it would've been better. It was SUCH a pointless idea to have two directors, good lord."
I loved this movie it was so beautiful I cried so hard watching it.
I loved it! It was a great ending
A must see for all who have followed the Star Wars saga.
That it remembers that Star Wars is meant to be campy. It closed out the story well.
"The Rise of Skywalker feels like we're back in safe hands (JJ) and so once again, every moment is visually awesome, exciting, dramatic, and/or funny - the way Star Wars is supposed to be!! I watched it with a Ten Year Old beside me, saw it for what it was - a brilliant piece of first class entertainment! In other words, a great movie!"
Disappointed. The plot was predictable as the story unfolded. The filmatography and direction seemed like a b-grade movie made for tv piece. Truly disappointing end to the saga.
"Firstly so you know I'm not a hater. I won't have it The Last Jedi was terrible. For me it was one of the best Star Wars films, classic cinema.

This one, shame. Just too much crammed into it, that you spend half the time asking questions.
Would have made more sense to make 2 films out of it."
"The big explosion after the train wreck that was this poorly planned new trilogy. A tragic disaster, but still makes for a big spectacle."
I don't know what I just witnessed. I could type a novel on everything wrong with this but real Star Wars fans already know and I'm glad I gave zero money to this film.
meh. glad I saw it free on a plane.
"Bad movie.. Its pretty and effects too! But the story and plot is ridiculous! And the entire Disney sequel trilogy is just bad bad bad.. Also so much is ruined in this movie.. Force healing, Force skype calls, Force teleport items? I could go on.. its just bad! 
I would NOT recommend."
"I thought that Rise Of Skywalker was OK... The special effects were astounding and there was some nice character development on Rey, but the story was bland as dishwater."
This finished an awful trilogy. Even the prequels was better than this tripe. So disappointing
I think its a great movie an i know it has some problems but as a long time SW fan I loved it!
"What should I even say
Disney movies are all about Fan Service nowadays to be honest! Including all marvel films.
This movie was catered to teenagers & kids.
Unoriginal & weak. A Starwars movie that no adult would enjoy! 
Weak"
I guess the bar was pretty low after the RJ disaster... at least this was fun to watch.
This is a big disaster!!!
"Just sucks! This last trilogy was really bad. JJ Abrams destroy Star Wars. The episode 7 and 8 was bad, but this was awful, I really hate Star Wars now. 

Nothing works in this movie. Hopefully I don't drop my money in the movies and this was the only Star Wars movie can't see in theater. If you don't have see it, please, don't do it."
"Backtracks from the previous two sequel entries all for the sake of abruptly ruining character arcs. Writes out previously established characters all for the sake of plot progression. While the movie tries to explain already established characters, it still tries to introduce new ones. ""Tries"" being the key word here. The ever so mystical force is used to write the cast out of a series of roadblocks of the situations. Countless plot holes and approximately four different MacGuffins thrown into these sequences of quick-cut 30 second scenes one after another. Poor editing and sequencing with little to no enticing action or drama."
"Please stop making the same movie over and over. It's been since 1977 and the only Star Wars movies to show any creativity, beyond the first one, are The Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One."
"It´s a not so good film it´s not terrible but, not so good.One of the worst star wars and the worst disney triology."
"I haven't walked out of a franchise movie this disappointed in a while...like, was that the ending of Star Wars? Literally, like...whoever has these new movies, they have an uphill battle."
"I hope they go the way of the Mandalorian.
This was entertaining, But a disappointment"
"Combattimenti sempre più epici.
Trama onestamente poco credibile, il ritorno di Palpatine e il bacio finale con annessa morte non sembrano grandi trovate."
"This movie did what few ever could, It ruined the pervious movies retrospectively. Lukes story arc- meaningless. Darth Vaders sacrifice- pointless. The force? Who cares. Yoda? Just an old fool. Obi wan sacrifice and struggle? Not meaningful in any way. Who ever wrote this movie does not understand what star wars is and why people identified with it in such a meangful way. I loved star wars, hell I was a massive fan, watched all the movies as soon as they came out. I read the books..Now? I can honestly say its not for me anymore. Thanks Disney, great job"
Not particularly groundbreaking in any way and kind of slogs through the plot but still has its moments. Really shows how Disney didn't have any plan whatsoever. It was clearly made specifically for the incredibly loud haters of The Last Jedi.
I thought the movie was amazing screen wise but there was a whole lot of plot holes like hyperspace jumping and how the palpatines skip a generation force wise all in all it was a good ending to one of my favorite series but I feel like they rushed it too much
"Similar to Episode VII in that it was neither bad not good. There was some nice action and interesting ideas, but it was also paced horribly and had some really stupid ideas. While disappointing, it wasn't an atrocity. 75%."
Some stuff redeemed but other wrong
"This movie, though the end of the Skywalker saga, felt like a rush job with far to much happening. Yes it had adventure, action, and a Gillian but no substantial story."
"If Jar Jar Binks were to show up in this film, it might have redeemed it.  This movie takes the previous film and throws the potential for a greatness away and leaves one to question the validity the entire saga.  The acting is superb but the storytelling and action scenes leave most to more questions that really need not be answered nor asked.  The most frustrating part of this film is the lack of respect it shows towards the Skywalker family.  Truly, this movie spits on Luke and his cronies.  Had I known this would happen, I wouldn't have gone to the theatre to see it.  No, don't waste your time on this film nor the next one.  JJ Abrams might have re-spun A New Hope but this film simply tells fans to stop enjoying Lucas' vision.  I'd rather read fan-fiction than re-watch this movie.  It's a dud.  Sorry Disney."
"Much better than the last two films, overall very busy, the plot thunders along so if you blink you might miss a key plot point. I liked that they finally explained where Rey got her force powers. One thing I think is important, be sure to carb load before you force heal someone with your life force."
Movie was awful. They have ruined star wars with this movie and the others
Not worth watching.  If you are a fan this movie will destroy everything you loved about Star Wars.
"Bittersweet as this was the last in the series. It was excellent, tying everything together. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"It's not terrible as The Last Jedi( I despise that movie ) But not as great as the prequel trilogy. Again, these movies only exist for the sequel trilogy to end in a cash-hungry trilogy that has no heart to the original George Lucas franchise we know and love. Lacks originality and fresh thoughts, but it is still a fun little movie for yourself to like."
"Got half way through. Felt like a bad fan fiction, like Hunger Games 3 or that last Twilight that no one remembers how it ended."
"Terrible pace, laughable story and dialogs (was this movie written by a child ?), shitty acting from most of the cast. JJ Abrams kept trying to say ""Well I agree with all of y'all, The Last Jedi was horrible, so just ignore what happened in it"". But at least, unlike TLJ, it was so random it made me laugh a couple times."
"Terrible plot, writing, and direction. First star wars movie I've ever seen where I didn't want to finish watching it."
"It is not the resistance who saves the day, but John Williams."
"Probably the most ""traitorous to the franchise"" movie ever made. 
So Palpatine says that he'll possess Rey if she kills him, 
so she kills him and now what? 
The movie ends insinuating Palpatine/Evil rules happily ever after. 
George Lucas must be fuming because he didn't turn up to the Premier."
"La película muestra tantos encasillados de cosas,que resulta ser un parcho gigante de una trilogía que defraudo."
It is a parody of a great series
"Stars Wars IX tries but fails in many ways to end a messy last 3 films. The first two Star Wars (IV and V) were ground breaking and plot driven cinema experiences, leaving fans wanting more. Then (in Episode VI) they gave us Ewoks (Oh look Star Wars fans, aren't the little teddy bears cute!!). They turned an adult franchise into kiddie land."
"A really bad Star Wars movie. It moves way too quickly, the scenes aren't given time to breath, and the final battle is one of the worst I've ever seen in a blockbuster of this magnitude. It's time for Star Wars to quarantine itself from the movie theaters, at least until they can find someone that can bring back some life & energy into this franchise. It's too bad, because I really liked the actors they picked for this trilogy."
"am a star wars fan, since I was a child, and this movie only tries to rescue all the inconsistencies, which was generated by episode 8, and trying to justify absurdities, ends up losing the essence of its story, a pity that Disney ended up destroying magic from star wars"
"Nice movie, everyone must to see"
Can Star Wars please just die already.
"Movie was mediocre,but plot was bad. CGI and other things were quite good. It was very disappointing ending of Skywalker saga."
As insulting as The Last Jedi.
"The worst, most vile, most detestable movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I hated almost every single thing about this garbage. The plot, the dialogue, the delivery, all pained me to watch, sometimes physically. If I had to give someone a modicum of kudos for this, it should go to the artists and costume people, they did a great job with what they were handed. The monsters that conceived this travesty in order to strip-mine our collective childhoods deserve nothing short of embargo. I will never purchase another Disney product, so long as I live."
"Good ending that imo, redeemed the whole trilogy. Plus, it was fun to watch, which I couldn't honestly say for TLJ."
Definitely had some flaws but overall a good end to an amazing saga and I’m so sad to see it come to a close.
"Plot is bad. Who cares for whom is not understandable. Special effects and CGI are excellent. Having grown up on the franchise, I wish I had never seen it."
"Sad Robot. JJ and Rian Johnson dropped the ball with Star Wars. The final movie installment, of a trilogy that does not belong in the Star Wars universe. From the start, this movie destroys the history of Star Wars. It feels like an old TV show that took a weekend to write. I would love a Terminator style remake and Act like these poorly cast and underdeveloped storylines never happened."
"Hoo boy, here we go.

Disney's Star Wars trilogy clearly did not go the way they were hoping. Changing to such a different director for the middle film gave the trilogy an uneven feeling. Rian Johnson's vision was so vastly different from J.J. Abrams', resulting in a hard swing from Force Awakens to Last Jedi to this. This could have been solved at the production level if-

WHAT IN THE BANANA MUFFINS ARE YOU BABBLING ON ABOUT NOW? PRODUCTION SCHEDULES? DIRECTOR VISION? NOBODY CARES ABOUT ALL THAT, THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU LIKED THAT MOVIE.

But that's the problem, 12-year-old James. There's so much more to film analysis than just saying whether or not you liked the film. With so many films coming out of already-existing franchises, it is necessary to view films in the context of their predecessors.

DUDE. CHILL OUT. IF YOU THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS STUFF, THEN YOUR MIND IS GOING TO BE MADE UP BEFORE YOU EVEN WALK INTO THE THEATRE.

An excellent point. I know I avoided the Rotten Tomatoes page with constant vigilance in the week leading up to seeing the movie, and even then, I was still really nervous that J.J. wasn't going to be able to pull this off.

AND DID HE?

I guess. He got dealt a pretty raw hand of cards. His villain got killed off, some of his best characters were completely sidelined, and Carrie Fisher passed away. He had a very unenviable job.

FOR SURE. 

He was able to introduce a new villain really quickly, and had a lot of interesting plot threads. I guess my main complaint with both 8 and 9 is the editing; it feels like one planet hop should have been cut out to make the film tighter.

IT DID SEEM A BIT LONG. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE JOURNEY WAS FUN.

It did work internally, even if it felt a bit ‘video-gamey.' The references to previous Star Wars films were also great to see, especially in the third act.

OH MAN, THAT FINAL SPACE BATTLE WAS GREAT. THERE WERE STAKES!

There are always stakes, just not very much in the way of consequences. The only character arc that felt organic was Kylo Ren's.

HONESTLY, HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST-WRITTEN CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE TRILOGY. SHAME HE DIDN'T GET A GOOD ENDING.

It could have definitely been written better, but he at least got to close out his arc.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR ARC?

Say what now?

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO END THE ‘ARGUING WITH YOUR 12-YEAR-OLD SELF' BIT YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR STAR WARS MOVIES?

Eh, who says it has to end here? I'm sure something from my childhood will get remade that I'll want to bring you back for. Until then, thanks for talking Star Wars with me.

MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

Ooh, I just shivered a bit."
The movie was ok but was not as well written as others in tbe series. The actors de to try but it just seemed chunky. But over all I did not mind it and watching it in the cinaplex thereater was worth the time.
"My lord ...  For me, this is the worst star wars ever.

A lot of nonsense scenes, forced situations, old characters that appear again magically...

I hope that Disney starts a new saga so many years after the original trilogy. New fresh story, new characters...."
"The Movie looks a lot like a trailer. You scratch your head for all the talent there how come, and I know they are paid a lot, don't the actors rebel and say something...it's just horrible!!!"
the plot was weak for this chapter like the other 2 sequels but the ending of the saga was satisfied for me so if you are a fan of star wars just you have to watch it love it or not let's hope that the next saga  will be great and good for us.
"Beautiful film, full of adventure and nostalgia. Were some plot points a bit forced? Sure. But was it a thoroughly entertaining film? Absolutely!"
I enjoyed the movie and was glad I was able to share the moments with my kids as my dad did with me. Not everything has to be great to be enjoyable and memorable.
The director did the right thing on this one.
"booooooooooooooooriiiiiiiing assss fakerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, bring THE FACKING OBIWAN AND ANAKIN BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLSSSS GOD"
The death of Star Wars. Disney finally killed the series with this poorly written checklist movie designed to please everyone and no one at the same time.
"In the history of cinema there actually have been worse films. That said, this stupid lump of a film creaks along, bubbling with illogic, a ridiculous story and uninspired acting."
Palpatine said do it
"Lazy writing, horrible direction, absolute trash, physically painful to watch"
It is worth watching for Star Wars Fans.
"Star crap, the worst ever. The series formula is just being recycled to death. Please stop, you have nothing left to give."
A lot of FUN! I enjoyed how they wrapped this story up.
"All around horribly done. The plot jumps all over, makes major reveals without backstory, and lacks any creativity. It feels like they tried to rob as many nostalgic moments from the original series and cheapened them along the way."
Heartbreaking to see these get more and more lifeless and sterile.
Kind of crap. Best of the new trilogy but not by much.
"What a load of unmitigated, convoluted, nonsensical pew-pew. What a bummer. They Games of Throned it. Let this be a lesson for all multi billionaire dollar franchises... they only ever existed because the word on the page meant something. Now, all they have is flashy spectacle and dripping sentimentality for when it was good. They never should have shot movie one, without having written parts 2 and 3. They never should have hired Riaan. I feel for the actors, some of whom are likely to go the path of Hayden Christensen, who had to be here for every minute. Even they must know in their heart of hearts what they made doesn't stand up to the promise of the potential of what that universe could offer if approached with intelligence, character and plotting. Sigh."
"No puedo creer que Disney, con todo el dinero que dispone para contratar buenos guionistas y buenos directores hallan aseptado esta basofia como el final de la saga galáctica mas importante que existe. Tratan de arreglar todos los errores de las películas anteriores de una forma tan apresurada que ni te enteras de lo que esta pasando y termino teniendo más huecos argumentales que las películas de Residen evil. Sin mencionar que los power up de Rei fueron ridículos desde la 7, y no pueden decir que su linaje lo compensa."
"It'll probably hold your interest, but the plot has its share of holes, and the characters are about as two-dimensional as you might expect from modern TV and movies.  Ultimately it felt like they were just redoing the original Star Wars.  Again."
"I understand why people hate this movie since it' basically episode 6. But I feel like this was a neccacary movie for the saga. some of the plot made no sense at all eg: Rey and Kylo defeat Stoke but then go back to fighting each other even after Kylo seemed like he came back to the lght side. that is only one example.

But all in all, I'm ok with this movie."
"This movie was so messy, confusing, incoherent, that the only way to describe it is insane. 
The hero is Rey simply an all powerful girl that has all the abilities needed to solve every obstacle without even breaking a sweat. 
Then there's the plot, every time they look for a lead a convenient lead giver (person or item) is right there to give said lead, and there is absolutely no point or motivation of it all beside the old star wars plot - Palpatine wants to take over the galaxy, Jedi rebels want to stop him.
everything else is exaggerated and unrealistic cheap plot devices to show how Rey the all powerful is better then the <put obstacle name here>...
In the end Rey wins the day, and says she's a Skywalker - because... reasons...?!

very very sad ending to a very sad trilogy that made no sense, so much so that George Lucas wants to take back the franchise from Disney and ignore this trilogy from the true plotline of Star Wars..."
"Very average, starwars really took a nose dive with the trilogy"
"Could it be any worse? This was supposed to be the great final movie that finished of the saga. It was absolutely horrible and uncreative. All the other Star Wars movies were just mindblowing and I understand it isn't easy to direct a final movie, but this, nope. Doesn't deserve 2 stars, I'm afraid."
Every trope in the book. Visually stunning. Absolute nightmare of a storyline/ ending to the trilogy.
This movie killed my childhood memories.
"This movie was really messy, I disliked it quite a bit. There were a few good points in the movie that I could pinpoint, but it was hard to find those points."
"This is a disappointing end to The Skywalker Saga on many fronts, mostly due to some seriously flawed storytelling that should not have been given the green light. It's hard to describe how I felt after watching the end credits roll without going into the specifics of spoilers, but the way this nine-film epic wrapped up left me feeling almost hopeless but more than anything, confused. Rent it!"
"No soul in this one, lots of confusion and distractions. And why did they have to make Rey so moody?!? Why can't our lead be solid?"
"Absolutely loved the movie. What a difference it makes having a great director in JJ Abrams making this movie. The storyline, the characters, to drama, the fighting, everything fits together. Thank you JJ Abrams for giving us this incredible masterpiece!"
This movie was terrible. What even was that Rey Palpatine/Skywalker stuff? It made no sense. The movie makes no sense and has horrible editing. It's just a bunch of action. You're better off watching the John Wick or Taken trilogy.
Ok film in the franchise
when all the ships showed up was one of the best part and there wasnt one part my family and I disliked at all
Es una tremenda decepcion para los fans de star wars. Una basura de pelicula.
"it was bad, destryed a bunch of things in the star wars universe, bad acting, bad direction, lacked imagination, bad bad bad"
I thought this was the best of the Star Wars series.  There couldn't have have been a better ending to the Skywalker story.
"Finally a satisfying story, now we can finally forget that trash Last Jedi was.
The ding dong critics complain that it was created just to undo the Last Jedi. Good, because that movie doesn't count for the fans. Rise of Skywalker cleaned up a mess, unfortunately it meant it crammed a lot of story into one movie, but so be it, it had to be done. Screw everything about the middle movie that doesn't need to exist."
I enjoyed this movie. A lot.
"Well it was not the best star wars movie.Force healing is my biggest complaint in the movie. The whole point of Anakin becoming Darth Vader was because he wanted to find a way to heal Padme. If force healing was around he could have just healed her and his mom. Also that force transport was rubbish too! But there were good things about the movie like the fitting ending Leia got, and Lando coming back is good. Although I did not like this movie I would recommend it to any star wars fan. Overall it is a 57% over 100% and 2 stars out of 5."
An okay but satisfying end.
Terrible movie. Boring. Terrible messaging. Unearned emotional moments. Stupid.
"Easy plot, everything is the most important mission there is. Very little logic and more often a remake of the earlier movies. Still cannot connect to Rey. Really missing the learning curve that Luke had to go through. Rey is just the master of everything including using a skimmer she has not ever seen before in her time on a desert planet. I really miss the first movies and DIsney and Abrams are not capturing the feel."
"Shameful, sad, and overwhelmingly bad story. A fair ending to a bad saga. At least the special effects and the music can be saved. At least"
After years of good story lines in Star Wars I find that this was not I was expecting in the movies and I would want Dave Filoni to direct this film because his experience in Clone Wars
I LOVED this movie. This is probably the best movie since the original Star Wars (now episode IV). A really good way to end the saga. I think there may be a lot of but hurt misogynists who don't like that a seriously bad-ass WOMAN carried this movie.  But Rae is fantastic and I was gripped at every stage. Truly an epic end to an epic saga.
"While the story did take a few shortcuts, I don't understand the level of hate being leveled at 'Rise Of The Skywalker'... certainly not to the extent where fanboys want George Lucas to return - who proved he can't write or direct his way out of a wet paper bag with the horrendous Prequels"
"I really tried to like it, I really did, unfortunately this whole movie seems forced. It looks like it was slapped together in the last few days before release...
Sorry Disney, but the characters deserve better, as well as the audience."
What a piece of shit of a movie. George Lucas did a big mistake by selling the Star Wars rights to Disney. So they ended up making this nonsensical trash.
Hot f**king garbage. Fun space adventure but THIS IS NOT STAR WARS.
"Missing a 2nd movie , but a fun ride overal. To me it shows how J.J. could have made a fun tribute to the original if he had done all 3 movies. Though it still doesn't add anything to star wars. I was OK with the first movie , hated the 2nd and i actually like the 3rd one."
I loved the conclusion of the story minus a few annoying details but overall if you are a fan of Star Wars it will be a great time!
"maintenant les sabres laser ne sont pas assez forts pour couper des armes, du monde.. :)  horrible"
"If there had been more Richard E Grant, this may have been a better movie. Criminally underused.

The rest of the movie is just awful. Unintentionally comical, poor storytelling, and the ruining of an iconic scene fro. The original movie.

The usual bish bosh bang and great special effects, but the film was a big let down. Some more clinical editing could've saved this film, as with the previous movie (Force movement). 

A poor end and to a tri-trilogy and to the poor trilogy itself.

Rogue one continues to look more like a masterpiece. Lets hope they can maintain the quality of the Mandalorian."
"All negative critics are wrong !!! Sure, it has it's flaws, like some unanswered questions and unfilled parts, but overall The Rise of Skywalker happens to be the great ending to one big and beloved Star Wars saga. Way better than The Last Jedi if you ask me."
"I understand that I, as an expanded universe fan, am absolutely not the target for these movies. If you want an action-packed movie, and can get over sloppy narratives, deus ex tropes, and plot convenience, definitely watch this movie, otherwise it will take you out of an otherwise immersive experience."
I was 4 years old when I saw IV. IX was amazing because it brought me back to the magical fantasy I have loved my whole life. The circuit is now complete.
This movie was supposed to be the big climax of grand saga. Insted it feels like a fanfic written by a 9 year old.
"Star Wars has always made me feel things, whether they be joy, sadness, anger, bittersweetness, peace, satisfaction, etc. I think it's important to note that this is the first Star Wars movie where, besides the Han Solo scene, I genuinely felt very little during the entire film. I genuinely think it is nearly soulless. And once I left, I was hit by a wave of feelings: disappointment, annoyance, frustration, confusion, and finally a sort of dissatisfied surrender as I realized this is how the saga ended whether I liked it or not."
"This is the best of the new trilogy. Ignore the critics, it seems to me that as a Star Wars fan from the very beginning (born in 1975) that the critics were almost trained to dislike this movie. As a passionate lover of the Star Wars universe, and not a big fan of the last two movies but still enjoyed them, I can say this was the best of the new three."
"Pode soar estranho para muitos, mas considero esse filme realmente o melhor da nova trilogia.

Por mais que nunca tenha sido um hater das prequels, eu sempre enxerguei seus defeitos e nunca considerei os dois primeiros episódios muito empolgantes. A Vingança dos Sith se salva com certeza, mas ainda assim possui erros que descendem dos filmes anteriores.

Mesmo sem um roteiro tão complexo igual aos episódios I, II, e III, as sequels foram muito mais divertidas de se assistir e animadoras do que eles puderam ser. Os personagens são muito mais carismáticos e possuem seus bons momentos, além de passarem mensagens muito importantes.

Rise of The Skywalker só foi mal avaliado pelos críticos por que eles amaram The Last Jedi, diferente da maioria dos fãs, só conferir as notas no Rotten Tomatoes que você perceberá. Enquanto o anterior passava mais uma mensagem de renegação do passado esse transmite a ideia de que seu passado não é suficiente para te prender mas que é impossível abdicar dele por completo.

É dissonante e isso que tornou a discussão tão difícil, mas apesar da ideia de The Last Jedi ter sido mais original suas falhas de roteiro foram para mim imperdoáveis. O episódio IX também possui erros, como toda essa questão da volta do Palpatine, os rastreadores Sith e até algumas conveniências, mas tudo isso é explicado pelo ritmo alucinado que o filme segue do início ao fim para trazer um final satisfatório a saga. Questões menores foram deixadas para materiais externos explicarem e mesmo que isso seja um erro terrível no cinema, se torna perdoável em um cenário tão rico em material diversificado que se tornou Star Wars.

Diferente de The Force Awakens que foi muito mais no seguro, esse conseguiu inventar mais coisas novas e trazer nova perspectiva a Força no filme. Caramba, eles conseguiram curar pela Força e transmitir a energia vital um ao outro! Muito melhor do que o voo de super-herói que a Leia teve no episódio VIII. 

Considerando as trocas de diretor e a desorganização que o filme anterior causou, Rise of The Skywalker traz um final agradável aos fãs que mesmo não tendo tudo o que queriam conseguiram algo para se contentar. O legado dos Skywalker é eterno e isso independe de haver membros vivos de sua família ou não."
"The rise of skywalker is a pretty good film overall. One of its main issues though is the pacing and the reveal of Rey's bloodline at the end of the first act. Besides that though, it did well and I think this was another hit for JJ Abrams."
Felt very rushed with no time to have any type of real feeling towards any climatic scene. Not a bad movie but not a great way to end Star Wars.
"Lacking imagination, formulaic was completely unimpressed"
"Seemed very cheesy, predictable, cliche, and just not well thought out in many parts. Ending was by far the best part, although it also definitely had it's demons."
"Wonderful!! Fixed the issues that made ""The Last Jedi"" so disappointing. Excellent end to the entire Skywalker saga."
If you really really know Star Wars you will understand how she is as strong. So good.
While the film was fun to watch and would have been great if it was not part of the Star Wars film saga. This show's no respect to the story and plot of the first 8 movies and what could have been an Avengers Endgame level of conclusion I was left feel blah and done with Star Wars.
This final Saga Star Wars Skywalker
"it has crispy visuals, although the story.......... is confusing..........."
"They fell short explaining certain characters in the story. It was rushed and they didn't get into any detail on how Emperor Palpatine survived they referenced that he had clone technology but, never confirmed he was a clone. Darth Vader being the chosen one of prophecy was all contradicted. In Return Of The Jedi the Death Star was blown into pieces. The way they shot the Death Star blowing up was a big nuclear explosion leaving the Death Star into ""space dust"" Rise Of Skywalker was lazy writing, poor character development. The only thing that looked good in the Rise Of Skywalker was the CGI they did with Princess Leia. Return Of The Jedi was the end of the Star Wars Saga. Rise Of Skywalker should've just been a 10 min youtube video dubbed as Disney's Official Fan-Film on their version of Star Wars.

I wish I could give it no stars. The reason why I gave it a low rating score. The Rise Of Skywalker didn't make any sense according to the story line Lucas left behind before he sold it to Disney. To me Rise Of Skywalker isn't canon. Entertaining to watch? Yes. but, it doesn't do justice on completing the actual series the fans followed. Too much contradictory to the story line on prior events and nothing really explained. 

Overall Conclusion:
The Phantom Menace should've been ranked higher due to the fact Darth Maul's character development and light saber duel were one of the most legendary fight scenes in the Star Wars Franchise. The Rise Of Skywalker didn't have anything memorable. Light saber battles were mediocre, nothing stood out. Just lots of recycled material with nothing new to put in the picture. The Rise Of Skywalker is Disney's Fan Film. So, They need to make another film that actually stays true to Return Of The Jedi Story or quit while they're ahead."
"It was like visual cocaine but Johnny Depp wasn't around to make it cool. I guess it was better than the book, which is backwards and sad... 

Also how is this movie ""most anticipated dvd coming"" if it has a score of half???"
Not sure why all the negative reviews other than a few things that didn't make sense from previous storyline. Overall I enjoyed it and liked many aspects of the movie.
Well it was like avengers endgame. I enjoyed it.
"trash, embarras ment"
"Despite the ratings the critics give the film, it's far better than the last movie. This time with a decent plot and getting rid of the space race, weak story arcs of the previous film. Though it has it's shortcomings and weird scenes, overall, it's the most original and best film of the trilogy."
A must see movie! Sad to see the end of an era.
"While it had its moments, and beautifully shot action sequences, this felt more like a fan film and Homage to #Reylo fans and The Last Jedi haters."
"I think this movie got way too much hate. I thought the storyline was great. Although, there were a lot of side stories.  It provided a lot of fan service and was one of my favorite movies. I came out of the theater loving it. I was so disapointed when i got home to the hate"
So i didn't liked the movie in general but i gotta say the VFX and Fight Sequences were pretty good. But the writing was not good and i also didn't liked how Adam Driver's abilities were wasted.
"This film is very good, because it  has lots of wars.The ators are relly good. My favorite person is Rey. This movie happens in a galaxy, the story is about: Luke Skywalker, Rey and her cousin."
"This movie tries to course correct from Last Jedi. Explanations are shoehorned in. It pretends there are risks, but has no consequences."
"I personally really enjoyed this movie, there were some odd moments here and there but its a very good movie. Best of the new triology, and one of the bests of the saga. (Personal opinion)"
This was ok but I liked the original ones best. I miss Harrison Ford.
"Worst of sequels, does not fit to the rest of them. Uninventive and naive plot, unnecessary new characters, lots of unexplained things. Was not boring to watch, it just was nothing special, like the movie I am going to forget it existed couple days later."
This movie is a f-n mess. It is a result of lack of planning and reasonable logical scripting.
Awesome ending to an exceptional saga.
"I liked very much! I smiled, I cried, I had much fun!"
"Great movie, it felt like some things came out of nowhere (not spoiling it) but I loved it. (I may be a little biased because I'm a huge Star Wars fan)"
Love Star Wars story line  good 👍👍👍👍👍
"I find it hard to dislike much about any of the Star Wars franchise films. Special effects and cinematography were on point as usual. The main story was kind of basic and didn't seem to allow for a lot of additional story lines or action, as can be found in many previous Star Wars movies. The end became quite predictable and was almost a deja vu type moment. Not the best ending, but not the worst for a franchise with some varying plot performances."
"I enjoyed the way it flowed and the effects were incredible. Never took my eyes off the screen.
Cast well for sure."
"OMG you just killed off every Skywalker and gave the galaxy to the Palps!!! Gone is Vader redemption ark, gone are the true Jedi, gone is the true magic of Star Wars. Every character worth a darn are even interesting you killed. We all know Disney had to as they make no money from the well written, universally loved characters but they replaced them with mehhh."
Despite it's predictability and tight corner it's shoved in after the previous installments The Rise of Skywalker is an fan-pleasing and heartwarming end to the Star Wars saga.
Didn't feel like original material.
"Just doing way too much. Watch the originals and compare to this. In the originals, there was a simple goal with each sequence and not a whole long list of characters to squeeze into relevance. The whole ""oh no, X character died... oh wait, nevermind"" was too much. Rey and Kylo kissing at the end was too much. Bringing back Palpatine was too much. I'm okay with movies being made for money, but they also need to have some artistic value. The whole sequel series adds nothing that is necessary to the Star Wars universe."
It was okay very pong I fell asleep
"This was a story that should have been split up into 2 or more movies.  Hectic is the story line.  No time is given to absorb what you just saw, just on to the next toy advertisement.  This seems more like watching a 2 1/2 hour-long movie trailer.  The kind that treats you to what you'll see in the actual movie, create all the ""wows"" and ""awes"" to jack you up for the whole story, without giving you too many details.  But even if they stretch this out, they would still have to explain the horrible final battle sequence.  I don't want to ruin it by giving away any spoilers to those who have been lucky enough to have skipped this one, but chances are if you are reading this, you'll still see it when it is released for home viewing and understand why I feel this way."
"I loved how the characters were with each other the whole movie mostly and how the final sequence ended, ending a amazing skywalker saga."
My dad and I went opening night and loved it from the moment the movie started. The action was great and the cheesiness wasn’t as bad as the Force Awakens. I thought it was a fantastic way to end the Skywalker storyline.
A major downturn in the star was universe.
"Pure, absolute drivel. Pretty lights don't make up for an absolutely dreadful story. All character growth was erased with a swift, terrible decision. Seriously, Palpatine is Rey's grandpa? Is that supposed to be good storytelling? If I could get my 10 bucks back and erase the whole experience from my brain, I would."
"....so...so dumb. Rotten tomatoes says I need to say more about this movie...which I mean isn't necessary...but...SOOO, SO, DUMB."
HAHAHAHA. What a careless effort.
"Star Wars ended running on fumes and with a flat tire. What a sad ending for a great saga. This is what happens when businessmen write scripts. If you ever read a positive review about this movie by a ""professional"" critic, please send that critic to the trash bin. He doesn't know anything about movies or he's on the dark side of Disney's paylist."
It was a good movie. I felt things didnt tie together really well in some spots.
"No esta ni cerca de ser la mejor, pero tampoco es la peor. La historia no se sostiene mucho y no creo que sea el cierre que mereciamos, pero esta muy entretenida y tiene grandes efectos y momentos de accion"
"It was alright.  They really tried to fix all the problems of the Last Jedi.  While the cast has really good chemistry, the writing just falls flat and you are left thinking about how Return of the Jedi already did everything Rise of Skywalker did, just better."
"The movie was very poorly written. I left before it was over. The film is a sad addition to the Star Wars universe. What were the writers thinking? Most of the movie is Rey doing random force stuff, with her boy toys following her around crying ""Rey! Help us!"", ""Rey! we need you!"", ""Don't do it Rey, its too dangerous!"". Complete malarkey."
"Watched twice in the cinema. It's a okay ending to a poor decade of Star Wars. I wish it was better, and that the movies felt like they belonged together rather than just having the same people learning the same lessons 3 times.

The movie is tonally and visually out of place from the first seven saga movies, but less disconnected than Last Jedi.

Also Star Wars is again suffering from the old problem of power creep. Something that happened in the older video games.

It feel like 2 movies, that are trying to cover the loss of its main villain in the previous movie, while trying to keep one star alive and not letting old hero's out shine the new ones.

Having said all that Ray almost seems to grow a little, but Finn is learning to be a hero again and Poe is basically proved to be the worst fusion of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker anyway."
"I don't understand how people cannot like this movie, I think it was beautifully produced and I loved the storyline, although the ending did leave me in emotional distress!"
Loved it was awesome it was our 1st star wars movie we have seen def going to watch then all now
"Ok, where do we begin?

Going in to this movie, i had my hopes set really high. Thinking ""Oh yes, something new and exciting"" But i also had my doubts when learning that Trevorrow had left the project and JJ jumping in again to finish the trilogy of. 

OOOOH BOY was i in for a big disappointment. 

This movie is a straight copy of Return of The Jedi, just as The Force Awakens was a copy of A New Hope. All the new random plotpoints just springboarded into this shitshow of a film, made me really, really mad. This movie made me feel that they simply made it as a continuation as if JJ also made episode 8, and that that movie was a basic copy of The Empire Strikes Back. 

Only thing i can really recommend in this movie is the visuals. Which are amazing, the score by John Williams and the group dynamic between Rey, Finn and Poe, plus BB8, Chewbacca and C3P0. 

Storywise this movie is a shitshow."
The special effects were awesome!  I loved the casting of characters.  Left the show feeling great!
"While the film is far from being a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker Saga, the film does provide non-stop action and fun moments."
"Worse than The Last Jedi?  Not quite, but still very close to being just as bad.  Ugh.. Disney killed Star Wars."
"The movie was a little fast paced, and had a few details that didn't fit, but overall i enjoyed it a lot!"
"I rate it 8,6 out of 10!"
Best Star Wars movie since A New Hope! My only problem with the film is the reylo scene
"J.J. Abrams returns to complete the third Star Wars trilogy with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  In the wake of Supreme Leader Snoke's death former emperor Palpatine announces his return, leading Rey and a group of rebels to go in search of the Sith world Exogol; where Palpatine and his fleet are staging an attack.  Abrams and his writing team do a good job at correcting Rian Johnson's foul-ups in The Last Jedi, and at resolving the story threads begun in The Force Awakens.  Additionally, Ian McDiarmid's return brings a new energy to the series and Carrie Fisher is worked into the film impressive well using previously unused footage.  And the special effects and action scenes are incredibly well-done.  While it's not the Star Wars film to ends all Star Wars films, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an exciting and action-packed space adventure."
"The Rise of Skywalker completely undoes the story of Anakin Skywalker, ruining the original trilogy and prequels in a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to repair the damage done by the previous two films."
I'm a film student. I've endured 4 hour long films of drying paint and I almost walked out of this one.
"Fan service, too little, too late. It was a failed attempt to correct course after the debacle the Rian Johnson movie, The Last Jedi was. Bad Writing, a convoluted story that made no sense within the Star Wars Universe that looked more like a videogame than a Blockbuster movie. Sad ending to a great creation."
"Lifetime star wars fan,  absolutely loved the final installation.  I think it retroactively made episode 8 good, NOT through retcons,  just ""subverting your expectations"" on how you initially interpretted the movie. Ben is love, ben is life"
"Movie Review:

Episode 9 didnt suck me in as the others did. It looked beautiful, sounded beautiful, but it felt wrong. Its hard to feel something for characters that abruptly do a 360 until they become unrecognizable. I felt more for Rey in her first few minutes of intro in TFA then I did in the 3rd installment where I should have been more invested. Kylo Ren seemed to be the only interesting character that had a clear arc planned out and was kept consistent throughout the trilogy. Wished there was more of him and less of the others. Full of bold, interesting choices that were quickly negated and turned pointless and meaningless. The plot was over reliant on mcguffins and were pretty farfetched if you thought about it. Regardless of what you thought of TLJ, JJ should of continued that story rather than retcon it. 

The story choices JJ went for makes The Rise of Skywalker not thematically nor narratively cohesive to the whole Skywalker Saga. The Last Jedi was at least telling you something, it had a message. Rise didnt have much to say as much it had things to show a particular niche of the fans to evoke nostalgia instead of paving the way for a new generation of they want Star Wars to live on past the original trilogy fans. And if you are into the lore, this movie makes the canon contradicts each other.  

Overall, I never want to not like a Star Wars film, that is the worst as a Star Wars fan. If Star Wars can be described in one word, it would be hopeful. This one is anything but that, it left me feeling hopeless. 

The highlight of this trilogy was Adam Drivers nuance and complex performance as Kylo Ren. If this move has one salvageable moment, it was the scene between Adam Driver and Harrison Ford."
It was better then the previous movie but i don't plan of buying this one on blue ray lol
"This movie is beyond garbage but very much in line with this blasphemy of a trilogy.
The day will come where Disney acknowledges just how badly these movies went and will work on a complete redo with a story more in line with George Lucas' vision.

In all these years under the Disney Umbrella, only Rogue One and The Mandalorian are worthwhile."
"I thought it was awesome. I liked when Kylo Ren conferred back to the bright side of the Force, especially after reviving Rey."
"Abrams does his best to salvage this trilogy after the dumpster fire that was the Last Jedi. I enjoyed the nostalgic parts of the film and some of the loose ends were tied up after they were forgotten about in TLJ. Overall Disney absolutely blew it with these 3 films. They had a golden opportunity to create an epic trilogy that would have transitioned the old guard to the new. Who? Really, who did not want to see an older powerful Luke Skywalker using all his force powers and saber skills at some point (not meditating to death). Oh well, what could have been......................"
"The film makers had a heck of a challenge given the state that the trainwreck of a movie The Last Jedi had left the story in. Abrams and crew managed to make an enjoyable if rushed and slightly flawed Star Wars movie. It wasn't a satisfying end to the Skywalker saga, but it is a pretty good movie in its own right."
It was fast moving and not too hard to get what's going on. Nice to see the original characters in it!
"While there is a fair amount of odd choices and weird/unfinished plot threads, The Rise of Skywalker is a decent Star Wars movie. There are moments worthy of the Star Wars saga, especially the return of an iconic character and said actor's performance, the special effects and the setting. If the problems bother you enough, tt helps to revise some of the choices made in your mind as you watch. And you get some creative thinking practice!"
By far my favorite Star Wars movie ever! Great way to wrap up the story!
"Disjointed plot, convenient and simplistic solutions to problems.  Felt like the movie was rushing to get through itself."
"I felt complete as I stepped out of the theater. It is a good closure and probably in par with what I was expecting.
One of my favorite moment is with Leia's part and Chewie's reaction to it. There are also a few other moments I felt deeply connected with.
Of course, it has some flaws (but as any Star Wars movie, just think about it). I wished there were more space battles (like in Rogue One).
But still I liked this movie very much, so what else do I need ?
Now, the Star Wars saga needs to rest, the fans need to bring peace to themselves and perhaps one day we will be surprised by the next step taken. Again."
"A conclusion that disgraces the original trilogy and everything Luke Skywalker did. Full of clichés, false emotions and bad explanations. It all started out wrong, with Kathleen Kennedy already in charge and then it got even worse with her bizarre ideas of changing directors and allowing all this booger to be made. The result could not be otherwise."
it was a awesome movie and I loved it
I really liked it! It tied up a lot of loose ends. Glad to have a happy ending!
How can the story be this bad! Only the visuals are good in this movie.
It was such a great movie and a fitting way to end a series. I will probably see it again.
"Overall, I found myself really enjoying this film despite the 1st half which does have forgettable moments and plot points. Despite my enjoyment, the first act really hurts my score and the entire film. The questions fans have been asking are finally answered, but granted, not everyone will be pleased with the answers. For me I found the film better than what I expected but I can't help think that some opportunities were missed, particularly during the setup/opening. Regardless, I feel Star Wars fans will find lots to enjoy as they go down memory lane with the greatest sci-fi franchise that ever lived.  7.3/10 - Walkden Entertainment"
A great ending to a great saga.
Great movie.  Dragged during the first half.  Really picked up after that.
It was a great movie & it explained some things that weren’t apparent before
It was a wonderful movie with an awesome plot to it. The one thing I was confused about was that Rey killed the emperor. Earlier in the series of movies Anakin was soppier to kill the emperor. It was an awesome movie other wise.
it was great but not awesome but a great finale for Star Wars movie
"The movie was heavily detailed and the new characters were great in this movie. I liked the new planets in the Star Wars franchise. My favorite character was D-O because he talked and not beeping, and he said funny stuff to Adults and Kids. I also liked there was adult jokes. Let’s hope they make a another Star Wars movie maybe 2022 in December."
"A disappointing finale. There are huge plotholes (""somehow Palpatine has returned""?), the characters act so differently from how they behaved in the previous movies, Force Ghosts appear randomly and it just doesn't feel like a finale, more like a random movie in a series. Pity the Skywalker saga ended this way."
Star Wars the rise of Skywalker is the disappointing trilogy of the Star Wars franchise
Star Wars Rise Of Skywalker is an ok movie. It will work for you if this trilogie is your first.
star wars the rotten tomato am i right like and subsbire
"Awesome movie. Don't go off the critics they only 
Crap butt crap movies"
"Loved it.  Wrapped up all the lose ends, and relationships for this trilogy (and some of the original trilogy.......watch Chewie grieving for Leia)"
It was a Star Wars movie and exactly what you would expect.
"The movie is a sinking ship, leaking with plot holes and they try to fill these plot holes with random nonsensical corks, but it can't save it this movie is dead... or maybe not its alive again!!! Oh its died again.. no it's not its alive yet again!! This franchise been dead since the 80s.. no it's not it's been alive the whole time in secret out if nowhere!! The good guys are bad guys the bad guys are good guys everyone dead but still alive, this film was absolute nonsense. Was the director drunk or high? I left the cinema scratching my head trying to work out what exactly they were trying to achieve. It's like they were making it up as they went along. The film was so choppy they cut fight scenes and battles and between characters so much it was an utter mess of a film, if it wasn't Star Wars franchise this film would of been one of the worst performing films compared to budget ever made."
Took my son to watch . We both really liked it can't wait for it to be on 4K to buy it
"I felt the movie pulled me in and then again as the movie and music rose to drama multiple times. I felt the actors and shed tears at times. Very powerful and a meaningful send off after 9 seasons over the years. It left me satisfied as the different times from the past, new and old. I loved the movie and I will add ""The Rise of Skywalker"" to my set of these movies that were so entertaining and I will watch them over and over."
"I was born the year Star Wars came out. Growing up Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie. At one point I could recite it. The was Herculean task to wrap this beloved series up, but I thought the did a very good job. I honestly enjoyed it more the second time I watched it."
good ending to the saga
"Marvel knocks it out of the park again with another tear jerking emotional rollercoaster. After Thanos is defeated, the Knights of Ren and Palpatine reappear, and their galactic onslaught continues. Only by joining Supreme Leader Kylo Ren does she finally defeat them once and for all. LIGHTSABERS!"
"Great acting and effects.  Lots of surprises, and a couple of not-so-surprises.  Wraps up the story, but leaves some room for more to come."
Im the fan who likes all the movies but if you're the picky fan you're not going to like it. They did a lot of detail stuff picky fans won't like. But I had fun and that's what matters to me. Don't hate me.
The saga was brought to a very satisfy conclusion.
this film felt like a disappointment and has me wanting a better ending to the Skywalker saga.
Solid ending to a very average trilogy. It’s a shame this is what they did with Star Wars. Could’ve been so much better.
Predictable tripe. May as well have been with by a 8yo.
"an hour in i looked at my gf and said ""do you even care how this ends?""
that's really all i have to say about that."
Kept my interest but .........
"I liked the movie very well.  It had a very nice closing finish.  It answered a lot of questions.  I really liked the flow of the movie, as well."
Garbage. Just sad. Tried to make 2 movies in 1 after mostly ignoring TLJ. Everything felt rushed. No emotional weight for anything. Worst Star Wars movie ever made. One of the worst movies of 2019. I wish I liked it. I really do. It was just bad.
"For the end of the saga. This is the most disappointing film I've ever watched. The acting is fine but the story sucks, but I'm glad that I saw Lando Calrissian for one last time. The action sequences were ok as well. The third act was fine. Overall probably the worst since The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. 6.5/10"
I like the idea of star wars but I never like the execution of them. And know the story behind the film it is depressing the lack of foresight and originality when there are so many storylines that i find vastly more interesting than the skywalker saga
"Entertaining, but the pacing was so fast there was no time for any scene to have any emotional impact."
"There were some plot holes here and there, but in the end, despite what the rating may be, this movie somewhat manages to pull off an acceptable ending."
"This is an amazing movie and is an absolute masterpiece. The sequel trilogy is by far the best trilogy.








But this movie actually sucks dick"
"I like it, and it's not a problem if I like it ok. Just accept that i like"
I'd give it a 3.5/5 because most of the movie was boring and violent it was a................  A STAR WARS HORROR FILM!!!!!!
Action packed from beginning to end
"It was ok, saw it a second time and no change in opinion. Others before way better!"
"Much, much, much better than the previous movie in the sequel trilogy.  A respectable end to the series."
"A film series of this magnitude will always be heavily critiqued, and what a great deal of criticism there has been about this film! 

In my view, Star Wars needs to be a fun, action-packed fantasy allowing the viewer to turn their brain off and enjoy the ride. 

The film delivered on providing consistent relentlessly paced progressive action told through a character-driven storyline, with a large-scaled overarching threat that links all the films in the saga together.

I agree with some of the criticism the film has received since release, it's certainly not perfect, although neither was the original trilogy. I find it interesting that as a consensus, the general public seems to approve of ROS, film critics did not. 

ROS currently has a critic score of 58%, while the audience score is 88% on RT - somehow this film has been judged too harshly, and I can't help but feel that it's riding an unfortunate wave created by the controversial splash that was made by the Last Jedi."
"Better than Last Jedi but still, that isn't saying much"
well... someone finally ruined my childhood
It was like they tried to shove 3 different movies into one. It was probably better than Last Jedi but I expected a lot better effort from Disney. There better be at least three hours of deleted scenes in the blu ray or I am not buying it.
A great finale to these wonderful movies Ive been going to my whole life.
"Gostei da idéia nostálgica do filme, é divertida, descontraída, persuasiva e até dá um ""Mind Blow"" I'ma vez ou outra. Entretanto, continua querendo fazendo o velho clichê de Donzela indefesa, saltos milagrosos, roteiro que procura sempre ajudar o protagonista, alem de ser raso."
"Disappointing, better then the other two, but still weak plot and storyline.  They should have just made the Thrawn trilogy instead."
"Everything that was right about Last Jedi, it changed it in order to make fanservice. 
No development of characters (even with the amazing performance of both Adam and  Daisy), no time to actually breathe between scenes, and above all an unsatisfying ending which doesn't worth 9 movies as it should. 
Best: Adam and Daisy's performance, quite enjoyable and I hope I see more of them in other movies.
Worst: Rey as a Palpatine."
It's an absolute mess. I was bored after the first half and didn't care about what was going to happen. I laughed throughout most of the movie because it was so terrible. Countless resurrections and plot going faster than an x-wing drained all of the emotions from this movie. Still better than The Last Jedi though.
Who actually thinks this story made any sense. It was complete garbage.
"To have been a truly great movie, this movie needed to do something special and different and great just as the first movies were special new and great. I didn't get that wow wow wow this is new and great feeling. But I didn't joy the film. I think the ending was acceptable and reasonable and entertaining but do you really want to have this ninth film ending in an acceptable and reasonable and entertaining way? This was the time to really zap the audience for one last time and maybe it didn't happen. But it was a good enough film to have done the series proud and not have done a disservice to the rest of the other films.
Sprinkling in nostalgic moments was indeed moving for someone like me in my mid-50s, but not the wow wow wow moments of something new and dazzling. But they were lovely to have and that was a feature that Star Wars took advantage of to help spice the movie."
"Horrible movie... This almost feels like I was watching Cinderella in space, I'm glad they give explanation behind snoke creation ,but one of the most confusing question is HOW THE HELL WAS PALPATINE WAS ALIVE THE WHOLE TIME?? His body literally got destroyed in the Death Star and yet the movie never explained it. I am sorry but as a huge Star Wars fan I have to admit this is THE worst Star Wars movie ever, everything did not fit in the Star Wars universe because Disney made it too happy like some fairy tail"
loved everything! i have seen it multiple times in the theater. will watch it another 50 before i die an old woman!
Great movie! Tied everything together for the final episode. Wish it was shot with a little more light and not so dark.
Loved the continuation of the Star Wars families. Great characters and just exciting story lines and twists!  The same quality as all the others!
does it even matter at this point. who thought sequels so rapid wouldn't cause burnout for the series?
Please stop. Its so bad.
lots of action & plot going on. dramatic ending....but really long....hopefully this is the end of the Star wars saga LOL
"God awful. While I could go into depth explaining my hatred for this movie, ‘Star Wars: the rise of Skywalker Pitch Meeting' on YouTube all but sums it up quickly. I will list five things, however, that made the movie laughably bad: 1. No consequences (seriously? Nothing bad happens to any of the main characters?) 2. The kiss. Just why. 3. Force healing?? What?! Why?!! 4. Bringing Palpatine back just because and giving him the most basic and boring motives. 5. Rey. She's just a boring character in this movie."
Another great film‼️ Way better than I expected. This is one of the best Star Wars films.
"I'd have to watch episode's 1 & 2 again to be sure, but this may have been the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen.  This trilogy was absolutely the worst of the three.  There is not doubt about that.

They crammed in way too much.  They didn't fill any plot wholes, but created new ones.  The death of the emperor was a complete joke.  Anakin Skywalker's story arc loses its weight because of these films.  It is obvious the creative team had no plan for the story arc across episodes 7,8, and 9.  Its almost like they planned to trash the original trilogy."
"So for all the people who KNOW, star wars is just movies and not real, this movie was awsome..."
"Awful movie. I strongly disliked episode 8, but this one made episode 8 better in comparison. It also had the unique effect of undermining the entire 9-movie arc. There was not one memorable scene, performance, or line of dialogue. Absolutely abysmal."
More horrible trash from Disney Star Wars. It is so sad what could have been if Disney only had a plan and good leadership in place for these movies but sadly they didn't and still don't. This move makes no sense.
Great conclusion to an amazing series of movies!
Good movie - but it felt like The last season of game of thrones - too rushed.
"Not giving any spoilers. I do have to admit J.J. Abrams had some big shoes to fill in completing George Lucas's saga in the Star Wars Empire. You could tell it was a corporate film finishing the legacy and not Lucas himself. It was good, I can only say it was not Lucas good."
"Star Wars: Episode IX- The Rise of Skywalker is a combination of everything good and bad in the Star Wars franchise from the Prequels' bad dialogue to eye rolling moments to abrupt character turns to the original trilogy's shining moments of the heroes together to the heartwarming emotion and to the essential theme of anyone can be a hero even with a dark past. As the ending of the Sequel Trilogy, this film is a solid great conclusion. As the ending of the entire Skywalker Saga, it was a disappointment. As a film overall, it was okay."
Loved how they connected it with the 1977 Star Wars without it being cheesy.  Loved to see the characters connect.
"Satisfying tie-up to the Star Wars saga. Remained true to George Lucas original vision. The plot was exciting, suspenseful, and witty (where it needed to be). Downside: the film is too long. Some of the plot threads were extraneous. The movie would have flowed better if it was no more than 2 hours."
"The action was fun and the movie obviously has a large budget. The acting was good too. However, I found the story to be too much of everything working out for the good guys. They did a good job of tying everything up but I just want the Star Wars movies to be something that they aren’t - much darker. It was fun though."
"I Jomama enjoyed this movie a lot

SO WRITE GOOOOD REVIEWS OR ELSE"
Very boring. Confusing and full of macguffins that lead you other macuffins. Forced situations like healing the worm with the force. Why would she even attempt that if she didn’t know about it. Why didn’t yoda and kenobi ever use that power? Really poor outing
"Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker delivers a exhilarating adventure that is both emotionally and visually beautiful. Leia's scenes are amazing and the new characters add extra flair to the film. Overall, it's a great end to the nine part Skywalker Saga."
It was amazing to see the Star Wars saga totally wrapped up like that. Great!
Very well done finale to recent trilogy!
the action was awesome
It was soooo painful. The Carrie Fisher scenes were awkward at best. The acting by the living actors was not much better. Kathleen Kennedy should step down from Lucas Films for the murder of a great franchise. More like rise of Palpatine.
This movie was okay.
Dont listen to the critics. We wanted a movie better than the last jedi and they delivered. It was a good time and I enjoyed it. Cant wait for it to release on digital.
Represented what the entire series has from start and now until the finish. Definitely the best of the last 6 movies.
"Really liked the movie pretty good wrap up to the skywalk saga but there is always room for improvement in any movie, but as someone who has always liked the StarWars series I liked the movie"
Not enough space battle action
Best of the three. Made up for the Last Jedi which I initially rated really good after first viewing but after watching two more times would have rated it a lot lower.
Great cinematic experience while remaining true to the story.
"Was concerned that the ending to the whole thing would be disappointing.  It wasn't.  If you wanted to dig into some inconsistencies or ""why wasn't this brought up in earlier movies"" you certainly could.  But it was a decent movie!"
"The final installment of the insult trilogy which is the 'Sequel Trilogy'. Plot-holes everywhere, main characters who still had no character development by the end of the trilogy, which was substituted by shitty jokes and a plot which goes nowhere. 

All of these shortcomings made for an incredibly messy film which doesn't even stay true to the source material which came before it.

This is not cannon and never will be, fuck this garbage which is disguised as a 'film'."
completely disappointing
Movie rating with dialogue 1 Star.  Movie rating Without dialogue 5 stars.  The actors and story line get in the way of great special effects.
"Honestly just a boring movie, and a disappointment"
"El capítulo final de la saga que inició hace más de 40 años, debía ser el cierre con broche de oro que se merecía la saga, sin embargo su resultado no es el esperado.

En lo personal amé ""El despertar de la Fuerza"", y me gustó mucho ""Los últimos Jedi"", pero debido a la presión de los fans, se nota como JJ Abrams y equipo tuvieron miedo de entregar novedades y por lo tanto terminó la trilogía más reciente de Star Wars en más de lo mismo, con supuestos giros que en dos horas y veinte minutos no se encontraron, una duración bastante escasa para una entrega que tenía que dar fin a varias historias, se notó como se corrió para aclarar dudas y llegar al desenlace, y como en el limitado tiempo se incorporaron nuevos personajes innecesarios, exceptuando a Keri Russell, la cual es una excelente actriz y su personaje interesante.

Otro detalle que no convence, incluso desde antes que se estrenará la película es la resurrección de Palpatine, lo cual calza con el formato de una secuela de película de Disney, milagrosamente no la llamaron Star Wars: El regreso (o la venganza) del Emperador , el cual ni siquiera justifica de forma inteligente ni sorprendente su regreso, y seguramente la excusa se encontrará en alguna novela gráfica, me gustan mucho las películas de Star Wars, sin embargo no leo las novelas gráficas y no me interesa leerlas.

Otro bajo es la forma en la que hicieron guiños a las demás películas, no es emocionante tener que buscar en google cuáles fueron las voces de los fantasmas de la fuerza, como amante de todos los personajes, se quería ver personajes de las demás películas o series como Yoda en flashbacks, apariciones o de la forma que fuera, pero la forma en la que decidieron hacerlo fue algo decepcionante pero si despertó emociones. 

Al final se siente que la trilogía terminó, pero no se siente como el final de la saga, esta entrega es carente de originalidad, no integra toda la saga como se prometió, pero sobretodo se nota como cayeron ante la presión de los fans y a la fecha de entrega establecida. 

Sin embargo, en cuanto a los aspectos positivos los cuales son bastantes y dejando de lado que es el final de la saga y evitando la comparación, esta película cumple con actuaciones buenas, efectos especiales que no dejan de sorprender, y la música de John Williams, la cual siempre es de admirar y disfrutar, hay un cameo emocionante y una escena que saca lágrimas, y no hay que olvidar el tan sorprendente duelo de espadas láser el cual es de los mejores de la saga, la película entretiene de principio a fin, eso si al final, el tan esperado sentimiento de nostalgia que se espera nunca llega y en cambio, los pensamientos caen en ¿que pudo ser diferente'?, ¿habrá parte dos?, o ¿si nos enviaron una cinta con la mitad de las escenas eliminadas?.

El resultado de esta película es decepcionante, incluso es la peor película de la saga, sin embargo después de superar la decepción, El ascenso de Skywalker es una película buena que se podrá disfrutar más adelante cuando se hagan maratones de toda la saga."
"It is tough to talk about the Rise of Skywalker without pointing out some issues about the film. As a movie itself, it has a decent story and is easy to understand. The issues in this movie were the following: the tone, the pacing, and some...I wouldn't say unsavory. Some scenes in this movie seemed out of place. Despite my average feeling towards this movie, I strangely recommend this still. The big key detail I have noticed throughout the trilogy (Episodes 7-9) is consistency. I wished that more time was given for characters such as Rey, Kylo Ren, and even Snoke (if only). It is a shame that this movie was the last (presumably) in the Star Wars saga.  If you have time, do check it out when you can."
"This makes the absolutely needed reconnections to the original Star Wars trilogy after the soulless awfulness of ""The Last Jedi"". Felt good with a rollercoaster of emotions, and a decent job concluding the saga. Special effects were great. The massive stormy ocean scenes alone are worth the viewing. Solid 4 stars."
"As a film, photography, set design, effort, polish, all the things that make up a good film are present and are great.  However, the one thing that needs to be present was missing, a good story.  I was disappointed in the story, as with all the previous movies Rey's skill and prowess are totally unearned and we never see her developing, we are supposed to just take their word for it.  It makes for an unlikable character.  And it isn't even the BAD GUY, it's supposed to be the protagonist!   You end up liking Kylo more than any other character.  I won't spoil it, but it could have been much better."
"For actual Story Line followers, Disney Deviated from the common storylines, agreed on, across dozens of Star Wars series authors.. a must see for those that are indeed, dedicated."
wasnt impressed and very long
I hated Rey being Palpatine`s relative! There are a lot of points that no match with Episode 8. Caracteres are introduced from nowhere! And unnessessary the lesbian kiss on the end.
Probably one of the best Star Wars I’ve seen in years.  I would go see it again.
"In one word, this movie is contrived. Bizzarely paced with no reverence for what has come before, any who have loved Star Wars - and good storytelling in general - should be prepared to be saddened."
"Adam Driver can only carry this trilogy so far. This final installment felt more like a jumble of settings and characters aimed at maximizing merchandising revenues than a well-crafted story. Ultimately lazy ""revelations"" that fail to push any boundaries, but instead play it safe for easy digestible nostalgia."
this is my 17th time. I still laugh and cry. love the way it ties up the last 40 years of my life
"I felt that the first hour or so of the film was a bit rushed, but as the film proceeded, I felt it just got better and better. The ending was amazing, and Carrie Fishers send off was emotional but brilliant!"
It was exciting and interesting to see what happened to the old characters as well as the new ones.
"The Rise of Skywalker is not everyone's cup of tea. But I've got to tell you, two months later this might be my favorite Star Wars movie. I've seen it  5 times in theatres so far."
"This is a fun movie if your not too dialed into the Star Wars Universe.  For those who are die hard fans, this movie was a huge let down and missed so many opportunities.  I think it suffered greatly for having multiple directors helm the three movies in the saga."
"A masterpiece, the best end the saga could have-"
Still fun as a Star Wars film. But a lot of random and unexplained things and events. Poor story and bad ending
I don't like star wars 8 I like star wars 9 the rise of skywalker
"Love the Star Wars episodes,  very good."
"Big fan here - while some if fan moments were great, after seeing it three times- I realize how weak the overall plot actually turned out. Bringing back a big bad actually seemed out of place as it was never the plan with episodes 7 and 8. I wish they had built more on the ideas of the preceding movies. They could have still given us fan moments but in a better overall story."
Theres no damn way the audience likes this movie at 86%. No damn way. It was such a piece of trash that I cant honestly believe it.
I loved Star Wars.  I especially loved the merging of all the old characters as the story continues. I'd see it again.
Loved it the storyline plot &  characters all great this one was extremely emotional it got to me the only thing I didn't like was Leia & kayle Loren dying in this movie the characters were overwhelming the pure emotion & an unusual certaincy self doubt made this movie worth checking out
"Its fine i guess, its pretty dumb but its interesting but its not horrible but its just a dumb fun thin movie, you kinda hope for more cuz there's so much potential with cool characters, worlds and stuff but its just kind of a sily dumb movie, its not bad but its not great either, but its too weird to be mediocre or boring, its fine but I really wish it was better. The dialogue is really lacking and lots of characters pop up for 5 seconds with nothing to do. meh, I mean I liked some of the weird crazy stuff, tgat was the stuff I thought would be the worst but it was the best cuz it was so silly it was shocking. Hard to review"
"I’m not even a Star Wars fan, but this movie was very good!"
Did wish ending was different--great seeing all the characters from different movies!!
"I really don't know what to say about this movie.  I really would like to rant but I don't feel like typing so much.  Straight up this movie is terrible.  There are too many plotholes to count that don't make any sense in the continuity in the film's. Palpatine is back, for no other reason than  to replace snoke. They don't even explain how he survived or why he sent that ridiculous message at the beginning of the movie.  They did a complete copout and used see throwaway line from revenge of the sith about sith abilities being unnatural, just total rubbish and shows JJ is a complete hack whose gimmick is just making everything so mysterious and intriguing and than giving lame nonsensical endings.  They spemd no time discussing how Palpatine was able to survive yet they waste so much time in the movie on these ridiculous subplots and mcguffins, and new useless characters.  Kerri Russel's character was completely unnecessary and did not need to be in there.  I could pick this apart for hours, so all I'll say is this movie is garbage, nonsensical , and completely devoid of any vision. It's the worst star wars movie ever made, even though attack of the clones was bad and cheezy as least it made sense in the vision of the trilogy, but this movie makes no sense and is just overall ridiculous."
"Really disappointing. I was one of the few who loved The Last Jedi so this felt like an absolute mess in comparison. The visual effects are stunning and there definitely are some enjoyable parts of the film, but the plot is just characters running around from planet to planet. The palpatine reveal felt like a cheat, and the fact that his return was never explained was infuriating."
It was good. But seemed very familiar.  Was a lot like the first movie.  Left me with the feeling that there could be more movies to come.  Which would be great.
"I liked all of the sequel movies. This one was the least good of the sequel trilogy movies, in my opinion, but it was still absolutely amazing!"
Force healing. Palpatine never dies because reasons. Rey is the Avatar. Palpatine is the dark Avatar. It's simultaneously ripping other stuff off and also attempting to retcon the previous movie and also other Force rules. For reasons. This is the worst writing I've ever seen for this series.
Everything was just fine C display name and take that the
"grew up with the original three films , this film was a space turd compared to the original films."
"This movie was ass. It was too long. It was boring. The characters' entire development thus far was stunted. Their personalities were deflated. How could anyone have wanted Palpatine back in our faces? Awful. Literally laughable throughout. Rose and Finn got did so dirty, undeservedly so. The ending was the most unspeakable part. I could not have imagined something more ridiculous. To have a story this good and bulldoze it in this way is very impressive and disappointing. Justice for Rian Johnson."
Movie ok did not live up to its predecessors
This movie is a great mix of New talent and surprise tributes to the past.  Go see this movie and may the force be with you
"It was an awesome movie! What a way to end tha saga, it was my 3rd favorite of all the Star Wars series"
"This was the best Star Wars of them all!  Tied all of the original trilogy into the prequels & the final trilogy, bringing the original actors back into play as well.  Well done!"
Tied a lot of pieces together
alright but garbage at the same time
it was trash because luke likes it
"Yikes, this movie is a mess. I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist. It exists for the sole purpose of retconning an even better Star Wars film: The Last Jedi. The plot is incoherent. It's full of nostalgia thrown in for fans of the original trilogy, which wouldn't be bad, except the nostalgia doesn't make sense."
Another great Star Wars saga! Is there another one?
I really liked this movie. A nice ending to the storyline.
"I enjoyed watching this movie.  Way better than The Last Jedi.  I just Love Rey's character.  She kicks arse.  Kylo Ren never did it for me in this trilogy, but redeems himself, mostly, in this one.  Didn't exactly make sense to me, the Emperor's return.....but definitely didn't ruin the film."
"The Rise of the Skywalker was an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe. The film had great special effects, & a lot of the entire Star Wars story line comes to a conclusion within this movie."
"Something unexpected happened to me during this movie: I felt nothing. I could notice that the movie was doing everything it could to pull me in, with all the epicness and the nostalgia, pulling all the tricks it had... And yet, all I could see were the strings pulling the puppets, and a pupeteer going through the motions of a ""Damage Control"" performance, trying to please everyone and risking nothing in the process."

Like all Star Wars movies it's filled with great action and CGI and as the story progressed I would never have expected the way it ended.
I'm not a Star Wars aficionado but heard good things and had to see it.  It kept my interest all through and I enjoyed it.
"Great movie, it was a redemption to the last jefi"
2nd worst Star Wars so far
Several activities going on at once keeping you informed as to what and why
Pathetic. What an absolute disgrace.
Fun from start to finish.  Makes a few leaps of faith - but an adventure throughout.
Han / Luke / and Leia did it 40+ years ago. Now Rey /  Finn / and Poe did it 40+ years later. It was a fun ride.
I did not liked the 3rd act. Ben and Ray did good. 👍
One of the shittiest movies I've ever seen with no logic in any of the world or character actions that completely ruin star wars lore
"As the end to a saga 42 years in the making, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is incredibly disappointing.

Every time a character dies in the film, just wait a few minutes. This issue of the lack of stakes is a continuous one throughout the film. Kylo Ren's mask, which was destroyed in ""The Last Jedi,"" has been rebuilt, yet its cracks, much like the film's, are showing. Chewbacca dies yet he is actually still alive, C3PO's memory is erased yet magically it is restored. 

The film's plot equates to not much more than an inane side quest in a video game that has you fast traveling from planet to planet in search of various thingamajigs such as wayfinder devices and daggers inscribed with secret Sith text. New characters like Zorii Bliss and Jannah feel like NPCs you meet along the way rather than living, breathing characters.

""The Rise of Skywalker"" fails to accomplish every one of its objectives: providing a satisfying end for the character of Leia (which was not an enviable position to be in given the obvious restraints), providing answers regarding Rey's past, concluding the Rey-Kylo relationship, and providing an overall satisfying ending for the trilogy, and saga, as a whole. 

Babu Frick may be the only redeeming quality of the film, but it is hard not to think that novelty characters like these are created merely for the purpose of selling merchandise and toy dolls, which has defined the production of the ""Star Wars"" franchise for decades. Sadly, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is the latest example of what happens when filmmaking is pursued for the purposes of making money rather than artistic inspiration."
"Don't know where to begin. Commercial as to be crass. Re-hash the same themes and scenes from the precedent movies. Add a bit of Dr Strange Supernatural powers to the old mix and ... drive to the bank. 
Perhaps the worse of these all..."
"Cowardly, cowardly, cowardly
To pare a woman romantically with her literal mind rapist, torturer, and stalker is beyond disgusting and despicable.  At every turn they showed that they cared only for pandering to the absolute worst, bad faith criticisms of the previous movies.  JJ Abrams, I am disgusted."
Not my favorite Star Wars episode but in the top half. And it does a good job of wrapping up the story.
Abrams did his best to undo everything Johnson did in The Last Jedi but it was an impossible task. As with the last two films in the sequel trilogy the characters are plain except for Kylo Ren. This movie would have been good if it was split up to make the entire sequel trilogy. The pacing was fast so you didn't have time to catch all the massive plot holes that plagued it's 2h22m run time. On top of that Rey stole Luke's entire story. She even stole his sunset.
Story line  very uninspiring.
Really good and accurate! Love it!
The movie was great!
The movie was awesome!!!
"This is a bad film. It continues the Reylo b.s. from The Last Jedi. There are many things in the film that don't make sense. Overall, it excuses domestic violence (a la Reylo). Much like The Last Jedi, I won't ever own this on DVD. Evade this film at all costs."
"Hmm, 43 years to finish the 9 films. Did not meet expectations although wrapped long story arcs decently. Hate to note it, however too much gratuitous FX. Wandering story lines."
Way to many plot holes. Lame story shit all over the lore there was not one thing about this movie that made sense
loved it one of the best star wars movies
"This was an absolute disaster. This movie does not feel like Star Wars. Not only is it a badly written and terribly paced movie, but it is also a horrible Star Wars movie. The worst thing about this, however, is that it is the last movie in the skywalker saga. Wow.  It's a shame I have to give this movie even half of a star."
Excellent cast - so glad to have seen it with my family!
good movie. There are some things that I would change but overall it was a good movie
I was very disappointed as a long time Star Wars fan.
My boyfriend & I agree that this one has been the best movie of the series.
"It's a fun time. Pacing is a mess and it's super corny, but it's not horrible."
Classic Star Wars entertainment and must see!
Corny rather than moving & meaningful & thoughtful.  Its not George Lucas for sure.  TOO LOUD. RIDICULOUSLY LOUD!
Very well done - liked the twists with Rey
Great way to end Star Wars. Just enough to possible continue.
In the true spirit of the original Star Wars! A must for fans!
Great movie! It was a nice ride straight through to the end! A lot of nice moments for long time fans. Wraps up the 40 year saga nicely. You will love it!
Best ending to a phenomenal story we could've ever imagined
loved it even tho it will never be as good as force awakens because of how badly rian johnson ruined star wars
"Great scenes, fairly confusing plot line"
i appreciated how this film pulled  all of the story together -- it was a fitting end to a great saga
"Great balance of action, friendship, love, comedy and creativity."
"Spoiler warning, they kiss, then Kylo dies right after, such a disappointment for a fan like me"
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an extremely fast, messy, and overwhelming movie that loads all of its plot points into a shotgun and fires them directly into the eyes of its audience. However, the movie isn't actually the worst thing ever. It's certainly better than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" despite what some die-hard fans might say. But then again, ""better than garbage"" isn't exactly high praise either. It has some funny quips, some cool (if exhausting) action scenes, and a whole lot of lightsaber fights. But unfortunately, it simply fails to tell a compelling story in a way that is both narratively comprehensible and actually engaging to the audience. It is basically a Transformers movie with a Star Wars coat of paint. As Kylo Ren once said ""Let the past die, kill it if you have to."" And Disney has certainly followed that advice with this one."
"Story was disjointed and formulaic. Instead of one planet-killer Deathstar there were thousands of super ships with planet-killer weapons.

Too loud in the theater. 
Rather stay home and get it on cable

The seats were excellent powered recliners - worth the price of the ticket by themselves"
I loved the story line. And it wasn't predictable. Suspenseful with as always great special effects.
"Valiant effort in trying to correct the course of this franchise. The first third of the movie skipped around too much, but after that it found its pacing. Good conclusion to an “ok” trio of movies"
Not mad about the ending
Amazing ending to it all
I thought it was a great way to end the saga. They did it with all the information they had based on The Last Jedi. I know they probably wanted the same director for all three so there were some different interpretation of the 8th and 9th one. Overall the way it ended was amazing it came around full circle to episode 4 and tied into the first episode.
