10x better then the ST
i'm only giving it this many stars because of the music and the darth maul fight.
"No Star Wars movie falls below the 7/10 threshold, but this one came close!"
Still a better love story than twilight and still a better plot that Last Jedi.
music is so good the fight at the and too 10 times better then the disney triology
"Maybe it was the decades of anticipation. Perhaps we just expected magic. The truth is, this isn't an awful movie. But neither is it good. Best to just skip and re-watch the original trilogy again."
"Perhaps in hindsight, jumping back into film making after a 10 year hiatus and attempting to make one of the most highly anticipated films ever, wasn't such a great idea.  The film is confusing and boring. And truly unwatchable. The plot of the film once you can finally figure out what is supposed to be going on is actually quite good.  But the screenplay, acting and execution is very very bad."
"This movie is hated on way too much. It has one of the best Star Wars soundtracks and arguably the best lightsaber fight. People complain about the movie having politics, but it just adds to the world building, and besides, it's a crucial plot point for how Palpatine comes to rule the galaxy. With CGI that still holds up today and amazing practical effects, this movie also makes for some nice eye candy."
This movie is terrible.
"I was excited for this and went with an open mind despite the awful butchery committed on the original trilogy through the remasters. It sucked relentlessly the whole way through. The cast chew dutifully through the wilted script, but you can tell they know they are involved with garbage. The lamentable lack of drama is interjected by laughable special effects. The pace quickens, horns blare, drums are beaten, and with relief the whole thing is over ... but of course we know it is'nt. This joke of a movie set the tone for all the wacko garbage that got churned out in the name of Star Wars. People made money though, so that's to be happy for :)"
"so amazing, a great start to the Skywalker saga"
A wonderful begining to the prequel trilogies
"Not amazing, but I love it anyway."
"This undoubtedly one of the most underrated films in the Star Wars saga. If it weren't for some occasional clunky dialogue, it would be a masterpiece... the innovative and well done combination of traditional puppetry and figurines along with CGI technology makes for stunning battle scenes and an all-around visually impressive film. The story line is key to understanding the entire saga, combining epic battles with fascinating political intrigue and an emotional story of a young child losing both a mother and father figure along the Jedi path. This is an all-around great movie, and it's heartbreaking to see such absurg negative commentary. It's funny, full of adventure and creativity, lacks such intense darkness (while still including touching tragedy), and is indeed an incredible and underrated Star Wars movie. I highly recommend."
Still better than marvel movies.
"Amzing, perfect, great start to the Skywalker saga, exposition never gets boring and Jar Jar gets less screentime on future films don't worry about that. 10/10"
Growing up with the Original Trilogy on VHS while still being a kid and when The Phantom Menace came out it was so amazing for me. I loved Jar Jar Binks and still don't care. The midi-chlorians introduction was neat. The Duel of Fates one of the best duels ever. John Williams killed it with the score again like he always does. Liam Neeson as the pragmatic and wise Qui-Gon Jinn was great. The introduction of the fantastically talented Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was one of the best casting decision ever. The Pod Race was great and the design for Naboo was beautiful. Natalie Portman as Queen Padme was great too.
A cinematic masterpiece.  The fate of the galaxy lies with two Jedi knights and their adventure to rescue an enslaved people.
Everybody love Darth Maul.
"The Phantom Menace sets the foundation for the Skywalker saga. It establishes the setting perfectly and the expansive world building makes the universe feel alive. The symbolism of Qui-Gon as a father figure for Anakin is well delivered and Duel of the Fates is in a sence the turning point in the history of the galaxy. The chosen one needs a father figure, but instead gets a brother - Obi-Wan. Star Wars is about family, and this movie tells that story amazingly."
"It's a fun, visually beautiful film. Out of the three prequels it definitely has an energy closer to the originals, with enough special effects to do the impossible without relying on them to the point where the world feels fake. The younger actors aren't the best, but Qui Gon and Obi Wan really steal the show especially at the end when they duel Darth Maul!"
"disappointing, a very bad script and horrible special effects."
"As a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. The acting and dialogue are definitely off. However, if you don't look at it from a critical standpoint and just try to enjoy it you will have a lot of fun with this movie."
This Film is one of the most under-rated films i've ever seen. I just really enjoy Qui-Gon's concerns about Anakin and how he thinks he is the chosen one.
A good start for the prequel trilogy.
I would normally give this half of star but I decided to give it 2 and the purely down to the end fight scene and the music! It's amazing how one of the worst Star Wars movies has one of the best fight scenes out of them all. I wish the other films would of used the music from the end fight scene. Apart from that the rest of true movie is trash!
It's weird I went from loving this movie to hating most of it and star wars fans went from hating most of this movie to loving this movie. When I did a 180 star wars fans also did a 180. Ending scene 5/5 and rest of the movie is 2/5. Jar Jar makes the first and second act of this movie tolerable because he is hilarious
"There is a big difference in two subjects of this movie. The first is the events of the movie are based around an interplanetary trade war which is where the movie fails itself as it's not the most interesting thing to watch. However, the second subject of the movie is the characters, which is where the movie more than proves itself with the amazing interactions between characters and the relationships developed leading into the next movie."
jar jar binks could have been kept out and the story could have been told better with more depth
My favorite Star wars movie. Sets up the prequels perfectly. Awesome fight scenes. Introduction to an interesting plot that lasts over 3 and ultimately 6 episodes.
"Darth maul and guigon gin is cool, but jar jar binks gave me terrible aids of the balls"
It was so bad I thought I was watching Space Balls 2
"I liked this movie when went and seen it as kid in 99. That's the problem, I feel like only kids can truly enjoy this one. As an adult I notice how politically the movie is and how bad Jar Jar and Anakin are. it both bores and annoys me. Only worthy things in this movie are the fight scenes and pod racing scene. I still can't believe Liam Neeson agreed to this film."
"Pudo ser muchisimo mejor, Qi-Gon es lo mejor de la peli, y la batalla de los ""gungans"" vs los androides lo peor, todas estas secuencias de guerra quedaron bastante a deber, con personajes vacios y Jar Jar Binks siendo el heroe.
Me quedo con la batalla entre Obi-Wan y Qi-Gon vs Darth Maul, una de las mejores de toda la saga."
"This movie is an utter failure, both as film judged on its own merits, and as a Star Wars installment. A wooden cast, an over-reliance on some pretty awful looking CGI, and and mind numbingly bad plot were just way too much to overcome. The action sequences did have some redeeming value, particularly the lightsaber duels, but any good will those created was immediately undercut when the “hero” of the final battle turns out to be a 6 year old kid that bumbled his way to victory BY ACCIDENT! There are literally no stakes here. Nothing to root for. He made no sacrifice. He just accidentally pushed the wrong button (several times). Contrast that with the original films, where actual heroes went up against seemingly insurmountable odds at great personal risk and overcame through belief in themselves and in the Force. This film was an epic letdown, and certainly the low point of the entire franchise."
Over-reliance on CGI with little story and too much emphasis on comedy relief.
"This movie was decent, very slow but the action scenes do make up for it. Some of the acting isn't the best but this is a decent movie. (I have seen them before, I'm reviewing for may 4th)"
Darth Maul is good but the story is ovveral not a star wars story
"Just for the record I should state that this is by no means a great Star Wars film, however (and it's a big however) it does not deserve the barrage of hate that so many fans so consistently bestow upon it, yes there are elements that leave me wanting a little bit *cough*jarjar*cough*but it is a fairly well constructed narrative, albeit with slightly uneven pacing. The big positive from the first of the prequels is that the action scenes are pretty darn good, especially the lightsaber duel between Kenobi, Jin and Darth Maul, accompanied by one of the two or three best pieces of music ever composed for the franchise in ""Duel of the Fates"", if you hear that piece during the third act and don't immediately feel pumped, you're enjoying Star Wars all wrong. That aside, I actually find the world building in episode 1 really interesting, the world before the fall of the republic is so different, we are introduced to new races and creeds, whilst retaining elements of familiarity for fans of the original trilogy. On top of all that, but the blending of practical and CGI helps to retain the feel of the original trilogy, and I much prefer puppet Yoda to the updated version in this film. Now I've got all the positives out of the way, one can't help but feel like the actors weren't really that interested in the roles, either that or the director/writers didn't want to make them sound like they wanted to be there, with the exception of the infallible Ian McDiarmid, who is such a presence whatever role he plays. Natalie Portman is pretty wooden as Padme Amidala, Ewen McGregor, usually a top notch performer, gives a stiff performance as Obi-Wan, and Liam Neeson gives off as much personality as a wamp rat. In short, Phantom Menace gives us great continued world building, beautiful visuals and edge of your seat action, but the flat, unengaging acting is often what lets it down, given how much personality is so abundant in the original trilogy."
"The expectation is to know the beginning of the saga. Seeing a child Anakin, I generate the most interest. Then continue watching how the saga unfolds. I was puzzled by who Amidala was. In general the film is not out of place. Except for the child actor, who seems more like a Disney movie character (before Lucas was bought the saga) and the JarJar that gives him a humorous tone (which was not necessary), we can say that it is an acceptable production."
"It's obvious as to why George Lucas made the prequel trilogy, he just wanted to try out CGI effects, did it work? Kind off. I wasn't invested in the story that The Phantom Menace presented, I just didn't find it very interesting mainly because I was too distracted looking at the visual effects but there are strong characters in this film apart from Jar Jar Binks who is so annoying and wasn't needed in the film. This Star Wars film isn't the best but it isn't the worst, it's alright for what it is but it could have been way better, what saves this film from being bad are the strong characters and the final duel between Qui - Gon Jinn, Obi - Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul"
"A bland, boring, lifeless Star Wars film. The final battle somewhat makes up for it though."
"George Lucas' attempt to provide a backstory to the original saga is unfortunately sorely lacking. His endeavour into an even longer time ago in a galaxy far away leaves much to be wanted. The dialogue is wooden at best, which we can't really blame the actors for when the only directions they get are ""faster and more intense"". Like Carrie Fisher said ""you can write this stuff but you can't say it"". All Star Wars movies prior to episode I starts off thrillingly. Episode IV; a star destroyer pursuits the rebel ship. Episode V; Hoth Battle. Episode 6; Jabba's lair. And now episode I, trade dispute and tax laws. This is mostly people sitting around and talking and then walking around and talking, which is incredibly exciting when it's called ""The West Wing"" but in this case it's called ""Star Wars"" and it's simply not what we signed up for. 

So why doesn't this movie get just 1 star? Seems like I really hate this picture. Well there are some qualities that make it watchable. Despite the dialogue Ewan McGregor is fantastic, which is a saving grace in the whole trilogy. Darth Maul is a great frontline antagonist, and of course the score is amazing. John Williams' ""Dual of the Fates"" makes us glad that this movie exists. Overall if you wanna get into Star Wars you probably should watch it for continuity's sake, it's not like we have much better things to do during a global pandemic. Nevertheless, if you watch them in episodical order you have great things to come, just hold on through the prequels!"
"I do really love Star Wars but in my opinion, this is the worst of all the Star Wars movies. Its redemption comes within the last third of the movie with the lightsaber battle between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qi-Gon. The movies only go up from here."
"I waited in line for hours to get my tickets for this movie, and then again to get my seat. It was the most exciting movie watching experience I've ever had. It's too bad that those feeling have been watered down by others' opinions, reviews and their comparisons to the other films in the series. Special effects, CGI and plot aren't bad, but some of the acting and definitely the weak script are what bring it down. Jake Lloyd likely did what he was directed to do, as did Ahmed Best. It's too bad that George Lucas' vision of this film was so different than the expectations of the fans, which are impossible to satisfy."
It is a good movie but offers little to the over all story and progresses slowly.
"Expands the marvelous universe in ways we do not expect. The visuals, plot and action is on point. The music is absolutely en par with the original trilogy. The humor has intensified a bit (in the form of much hated Jar Jar Binks), but that's ok."
A trashy and unfitting but fun and energetic prequel in the Star Wars universe's canon.
The podrace alone should have won an award just like the jedi did!!
"Yes, I actually really liked this movie. I think the CGI especially the underwater effects are amazing and still live up to this day and the action sequences including the race, all the lightsaber duels and final battle are some of the best the saga has to offer. It explains the origin of Anakin Skywalker and his tragic past as well as Obi-Wan and I think Evan McGregor and Liam Neeson did amazing in their roles as Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jin and I really saw them as master and Padawan and they really felt like real Jedi. I also think Natalie Portman is charming as Padmé and I never found Jar-Jar annoying and actually laughed at him a few times and I do think the movie has a great concept and plot with the whole political aspect and it was nice seeing the origins of the Jedi and it did not contradict anything from the Prequels. Now I do feel like the scenes in Tatooine dragged on a bit but I do think this is a very underrated Star Wars Movie:
Overall: 9/10 (A)"
I didn't like this movie. I give it a 55% and nothing higher. I Jar Jar Binks ruined the entire movie and Darth Maul is the only reason the movie has anything above 10% in my book. Qui-Gon Jin was a character who deserved better and seeing Obi-Wan Kenobi without a beard was too strange. Only watch this movie because of its importance to the Skywalker saga.
In my opinion it is fantastic everything a true star wars fan expects giving little nuggets of information and teasing a little bit more
"La Amenaza Fantasma, objetivamente y desde mi punto de vista, es la más ""debil"" de las precuelas.
El guión en sí es algo complejo para una película dirigida para un público ""infantil"", destaco esto ya que la saga en general tiene varios aspectos que no son para niños, como las tramas políticas, la mayoria no les agrado este aspecto, es algo esencial en la historia, pero tiene momentos que son aburridos para el espectador, en cuanto a las actuaciones, no son las mejores, pero tiene grandes papeles como el personaje de Qui-Gon, interpretado por Liam Neeson, y el personaje de un joven aprendiz Obi-Wan, hecho por Ewan McGregor, pero hay personajes que irritan, como es Jar Jar Binks, aunque se vuelve importante después de todo, hubiera sido mejor descartarlo en el film. Los efectos especiales con el pasar de los años envejecieron mal en algunas escenas, en cuanto a la narrativa se siente en varias ocasiones lenta, pero mejora en la mitad de la película.
Destaco su originalidad, es cierto que hay ideas que no estan bien ejecutadas del todo, pero hay otras que si, por ejemplo los confilctos políticos y el origen de los Midiclorianos. 
Lucas creo mundos increíbles, lleno de criaturas con sus culturas y propositos, la acción es de los puntos más fuertes de la película y su banda sonora hace que las escenas sean mucho más magnificas.
Calificación: 6,5/10"
"Wish I could give it any lower rating. Its just awful. From the visuals, to the screenplay, to the dialogues, to the acting. Just plain awful. Its a pain to watch these movie"
"If you would look at this film, ignoring the almost-perfect originals and I think Revenge of the Sith. It isn't all that bad. Although it had problems with the excruciatingly painful beginning mostly due to the character Jar-Jar Binks, it held it's own towards the end. Overall, this movie has a rough start but an above average ending (that duel at the end)."
"For me, this was the first movie to see of the saga. It introduced me to this wonderful world... And I liked it! Yes, the story is not so good. But this shows the beggining of it all. And set bases for all the story to come!"
The only good part was Darth Maul first appearance on screen
"It's an under-average film. I honestly don't HATE it but there are a few aspects I do HATE. 

POSITIVES-
- Special Effects 
- Lightsaber duels 
- Ewan Mcgregor as OBI-WAN 
- Liam Neeson as QUI-GONN 
- DARTH MAUL

BAD (OR TERRIBLE)
-JAR JAR 
-ANAKIN
-CINEMATOGRAPHY
-POLITICS
-WRITING 
-GUNGANS
-DIALOGUE 
-POLITICS 
-PACING 
-TONAL INCONSISTANCY

I GIVE  IT C or 65%"
O pior Star Wars de todos o tempos
"kinda boring, but ok"
"I'd give this a 1.5/5, but seeing Liam Neesen with a lightsaber and teaming up with young Obi-Wan to fight Darth Maul (one of my personal SW villains), gives it an extra half star. But this is not a good movie. Young Anakin was terrible, and Jar Jar Binks is the worst SW character ever."
"This movie to me is amazing! The action in the movie is truly amazing and even though some of the parts can be boring, the story-telling is great. I love how Palpatine manages to take advantage of the Republic and how his ultimate plan is starting to unfold. Darth Maul is a great villain and their epic lightsaber duel at the end was phenomenal! I don't mind Jar Jar because his foolishness always makes me smile a little bit (despite the controversy). This movie is a great way to start the prequel trilogy!"
"In the wildly unlikely event that George Lucas should ever read this; I am so, so sorry. I despised this movie when it came out. I grew up with Star Wars, seeing 2/3 in theaters in the 80s, and this wasn't merely a continuation of exactly that, so I hated it.  It was for kids and I was in my 20s so I hated it. It was goofy and corny and I was in my 20s and couldn't admit the OT was goofy and corny so I hated it. Time goes by. Things change.  Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams happen.

TPM was not what anyone was expecting, because it wasn't what we had seen.  What we had seen, however, was a popcorn action flick in the middle of the story.  TPM sets up that story. So while we may complain about trade federations and blockades, that's where the story begins, in a boring and innocuous way, much like all wars. And it's a huge story and a huge war, difficult if not impossible to tell in any format and unthinkable in film before 1999. 

Rewatching with my children has given me renewed love for Anakin, Qui-Gon, and yes, even Jar Jar. It's stiff, wooden, operatic, theatrical, and all over the place, its spilling gold at our feet and we kicked the dust complaining that it wasn't like our leaden toys of old."
What the f*#k why was this made
"I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but c'mon the pod-racing scene and the Darth Maul battle are two of the most memorable scenes in the entire franchise. Everything else about this movie is garbage from Jar Jar Binks to well Jar Jar Binks. Why George Lucas?"
A horrible movie it is. Jake Lloyd playing Anakin Skywalker is a disaster and George Lukas's editing & directing makes this movie as tension-less as it can get. What the hell happened to his mind? I don't get it. This movie is mysteriously bad.
Ridiculous underwater scene
"I found the Phantom Menace really good. It's got a good story, good acting, and a great soundtrack. It's not my favorite Star Wars film, but I still love it as I love every other Star Wars film."
"This Star Wars prequel was pretty good. Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot to the movie was great and action packed. The special effects in this movie were pretty cool too. I did like this movie, but it wasn't as great as the originals. I would still recommend it though."
Worst Star Wars Movie
"It could've been shorter, better edited, and some aspects of the movie haven't aged well. It is admirable for the risks it took though."
me ha gustado bastante la verdad
"It has special effects that didn't age well, wooden acting and terrible dialogue, but The Phantom Menace compensates its flaws with a compeling narrative that shows promise for the next installments."
Sacrifices characters for word building... duels of the fates sequence is fun but everything else is disappointing
"I forgot how bad this movie is till seeing it again recently. I thought SW 8 was bad. This is the worse of all. Jar Jar Binks is borderline cringe worthy every scene he's in. almost as bad is that leader of the underwater people. McGregor and Neeson must of taken something to keep them from laughing at those scenes. Want 1 scene that is a joke to the max. So Neeson and Mcgregor follow Jar Jar into the water and use some sort of device to breath underwater. far fetched but I'll let that slide. But when they appear in that underwater capsule,  they are both totally dry. Just a joke. I'm actually stunned that this is even getting 59 in RT.  I guess more people are doing mushrooms while watching tv than I thought.."
I don't really see why this needed to exist.
It really good just put jar jar binks out and you'll see
"While there is fun to be had, it can be rather kiddy and/or cringey a bit too often, although the politics didnt bother me that much. 76%."
It's like the original film in feel...but different. Yay John Williams for a great score! The acting (with the ghastly exception of Natalie Portman) is consistently fine. Great story that doesn't pander to the infantile.
It  was okay. I still liked it since it shows how Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi came to be. It answers my questions on what happened to Darth Vader and all. Better to watch this to know the story well.
This film gets slated too much but it isn't actually that bad
"Fuck me, I still enjoy The Phantom Menace. The positives, which I've got with this movie have got to be Darth Maul, The Podrace scene, The lightsaber fights which Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have with the droids and especially the fight with Darth maul, that's just amazing, especially with the John Williams score it works so well while the scenes are happening. Also, the actors of Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn have got some great chemistry while they're on set together. Finally, I've got to say Jar Jar binks has to be another positive to this movie, he actually adds quite a few good funny laughs to this movie. The negatives, which I've got with this movie has to be the outdated cgi effects and the really outdated greenscreen effects. Also, another negative I've got with this movie has to be, there isn't much Darth Maul throughout it. Finally, my last negative to this movie has to be some of the cgi which doesn't hold up well during the fight scene on Tatooine when Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are fighting and the final fight scene, when the doors open the camera work looks like a 360 video. Overall, it's quite an outdated movie today but it's pretty good for a Star Wars movie."
Probably my least favorite Star Wars movie but I still really enjoyed it. It's kind of a pointless movie since if you remove this movie from the trilogy/ saga you would still be able to understand overall story.
"Casting great actors like Ewan and Liam did not improve this movie at all, but brought us very flashy action sequences that we Star Wars fans have never seen before. If this movie didn't have the tall squealing buffoon Jar Jar, and a different child actor to play as Young Anakin, then this movie would've been better. But it managed to pass its time with the sloppy writing and poorly acted scenes, and laughable dialogue."
"The movie was so cool , the story  was beatiful, the edition magical and the actors did a good work. it is for every age (general).
     This movie has action, adventure fantasy and science fiction."
"I never hated any of the Star Wars Prequels, but The Phantom Menace is definitely my least favorite of the bunch. The slow pacing, coupled with cardboard characters, toilet humor, and poor CGI effects just make it hard to sit through. That said, there are still some genuinely great things there. The blend of CGI with practical effects is fantastic in many scenes (not including CGI characters), the worlds are gorgeous and full of life, and the pod-race is a monumental achievement in audio and visual effects. Oh, and how can anyone forget Darth Maul, and the epic duel on Naboo?? Is Jar Jar annoying? Oh yes, extremely; however, I'd still say the film is worth checking out. 2.5/5"
"Jar jar has never really bothered me and this had so many amazing scenes such as the final battle and the fight against Darth Maul. Although to be fair, the political scenes were pretty bad and it had other problems as well."
"The prequels are not as bad as most people seem to think. Everything is a matter of comparison and nothing was ever going to hold up to the standard of the original series. I think the prequels get so much hate because they started with The Phantom Menace, which is the weakest of the prequels. But it's not a bad watch."
"After the initial disappointment this film has grown on me over the years. Yes the dialogue is clunky in patches, the acting is subpar, and there's too many unnecessary characters, but there's still a decent story being told. Seeing force users at the peak of their era is also pretty epic. This movie gets a bad wrap but it's nothing like The Last Jedi for terrible Star Wars."
"""What do people like about the original trilogy? It's politics, right? Let's do a bunch of that, throw in some midichlorians, some JarJar, and some racial stereotypes, and we'll be printing money, trust me."" Still, it's such a nostalgia trip to rewatch."
"a bit boring, but the final battle is quite enjoyable."
Bored and confused...
"Jar Jar is not very annoying, but still not the best of the bunch."
Amazing movie with good action and good characters
"Visually stunning, comprised of logically thinking characters, equipped with engaging scenes, and smooth flowing plot, Phantom Menace achieves what it should, a satisfactory introduction to the series in an entertaining delivery."
Not bad but not good. Definitely the worst Star Wars film.
"I fell asleep on this movie as a kid and revisiting it I am reminded why.

This movie is too slow and there were too many George Lucas-style cash grabs that unsettled me. Most of the movie seems to have been wanting to sell me cheap merchandise than tell an actual story. Least the pod racing video game was fun.

But George Lucas really did a number on his original creation. What's up with the Gungans? Why the pod racing scene? Midichlorians?

Not to mention the boring Jedi council scenes and the really confusing ending sequence. The movie tried to achieve too many things at once.

.5/5. RIP Darth Maul."
"A movie with cluttered writing, unisteresting acting, and annoying characters. Episode 1 is saved by its epic finale"
"It's a great visual experience. But this is primarily a kid's film. You have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. Still, I consider it the best of the three prequels."
"The Ending may be in the foreground,but that doesn't mean that everything is terrible"
"Well if you know of the originals then you understand where this movie must take you.  With that said Young Anakin Skywalker acting is a little high school drama-is at times, the big race in the middle of the film really slows down the movie and you are left wondering when will it end.  The fight for Nabu is ok, but trying to create different accents in language for different creatures can leave you wondering if you hear what they said and at times can take away from the film.  The main story line is fine and the final Jedi verse Sith battle is one of the best but the end is almost episode 4 like and yet remember they did just win a large battle for their planet so I get it.  Over all I liked the movie, it's not as bad as everyone seems to believe and I would watch is any day of the week of the newest movies episodes 7,8, and 9."
"Bogged down by too much dialogue and not enough action and adventure, The Phantom Menace only grasps my attention for certain scenes and fails to make a lasting impression."
"Cheesy but fun.  Doesn't live up to the originals, but how could it.  Great third act though."
"Bad dialogue, CGI and action were good, but with mostly poorly written characters."
"Ugggh. Poor writing, clunky dialogue, midicholrians nonsense, Jar Jar and young Anakin is so annoying, podracing is boring and all of the politics is boring. The only thing good about this movie is Darth Maul and the end lightsaber battle."
"Not the best, but not the worst, this is a movie that passes the time once you look past a certain Gungan..."
"It was great. John Williams nailed the soundtracks, the fx look perfect for their time and the story is interesting from start to finish. I never were bothered by Jar Jar as some folks say. For me it's a must watch."
"Positives: This movie has the best score in all of Star Wars. The action is great, especially the final confrontation with Maul. The final act is nearly perfect. While the film suffers from mostly average characters, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Palpatine and Watto are all very enjoyable to watch. The visuals are stunning, even to this day.
Negatives: Political mumbo jumbo, Jar Jar and certain other characters, weakened theming of the Jedi and the Force and the second act is too long and unnecessarily drawn out.
7/10 - B-"
"This Star Wars movie is really boring, a lot of people love the prequels and i really can see why, the only good thing in the movie is the action at some points."
Honestly extremely cringy
"Story could've used some work.
Acting was alright."
"Although slow at times, and yes there is errors in this movie , I feel this movie was unfairly judged. No it's not the originals nor does it try to be. I understand the hate of jar jar bunks, but are you really going to like every creature in the galaxy? Jar Jar is a great addition for kids to enjoy. Also, this film has Liam in it, that alone should be enough."
"Maybe George Lucas thought that the Phantom Menace was an important and crucial addition to the Star Wars saga. And maybe it really was. But regardless of the movie's necessity, the fact that 'it's boring' still remains."
"Not as bad as some say, The Phantom Menace is a decent movie that is entertaining and expands the Star Wars lore."
"I think the movie was great. I mean i can understand why people didn't like it 
but i enjoyed it so."
Technically the worst but at least it isn't sacrilegious to the starwars mythology
"Suggested Audience: Everyone |
Critical Rating: B |
Nostalgia Factor: Insane |
Viewings: 4+ |
Detail: This film is many of the things that have been thrown at it. Still, it stands as a monument in the world of Star Wars. Some of it's best elements include the podracing, the Darth Maul sequence, Qui Gon and Obi Wan, and the score. Every moviegoer should give it a shot, though, be warned, you're likely to find much of the film dull and lifeless, as I've heard so many describe it."
"The fifth great SW movie. The fans are very wrong about this film, all was so nice. The first chronologie's film of SW saga. The special effects, memorable music(superb Duel of Fates), the great characters, the great lightsabers fights and the performance of Ray Park as Darth Maul; the second best vilain after Darth Vader. I admit it has imperfection but is not a reason to treat a great movie, i respect the epis.1."
"This is my least favorite Star Wars film. There are some good things like Liam Neeson being in it. The final act is entertaining and well made, but the rest is boring, poorly done, and underdeveloped. What could have been a great start for Anakin's origin ends up focusing on trade relations and the Galactic Senate. Overall, the final act partially saves this film, but it's still bad."
"This one is severely underrated. 20 years later and it has aged very well. Qui Gon Jin, Darth Maul, Duel of the Fates, podracing, the best lightsaber duel of any movie. It’s a classic"
Hated Jar Jar but it did reboot Star Wars. In a movie marathon I avoid this movie.
"There's a lot wrong with this film, although it ends up being a enjoyable watch, but purely down to the fact I love Star Wars. One of the best parts about this film is it's score, it's composed amazingly, it's sad that the best part of a action film is it's score. There's more bads than hoods and the only reason it gets slightly more stars is because I'm a Star Wars fan, but Jar Jar Binks is a awful character and that's down to the writing. The CGI/Special Effects are now very outdated and poor, that may be due to the drastic change in special effects but they don't hold to today's standard and is very noticeable. This film could've been shortened most definitely, too many sections of the film dragged on for too long, especially the pod race scene."
Not a fan. The acting and effects are trash.
God awful acting. Poor script. Cheesy CGI. Such a waste.
"I love this movie,it always gets crapped on so I figured I'd log on to defend it!! It's cheesy yes but honestly that's the charm of Star Wars !! Jar jar ,pod races n all I love it !! Plus Dart maul is the shiznit!!!"
"A very disappointing turn out for the first ""Star Wars"" prequel, ""The Phantom Menace"". Some solid visual effects and moments of world-building really can't justify the blatantly underwhelming performances and a lack of character development. It's the weakest entry in the once-grand franchise, and they really need to get back on track. They could have done worse though.

50/100"
Best of all the star wars movies imo.  It gets horrible reviews from old school fans.  But at least it was an original story unlike the old rehashed plotline like in the new Disney starwars films.
One of the most underrated movies there are. People hate it for no reason. Qui-Gon was a great character and the final duel was one of the best duels.
"Great start to the saga, always enjoyed episode I! Jar Jar is LIFE!"
"A fun, but wayyyyyyyyy too silly, re-entry into the Star Wars world.  Darth Maul is cool, though!"
"Não é um filme horrível, mas é ruim"
Painful to watch. Shockingly terrible acting and dialogue. The worst of all the movies.
"This is an awful movie with a very bad writing. But Darth Maul, Ewan McGregor and liam Neeson were really cool :)"
"Rewatching it after the sequels, I have a whole new appreciation towards it."
"So underrated and unappreciated. Since it was the first film after the original trilogy, it got rated harshly against an extremely high standard... but if you step back and look at what it did, at the time it did it, you can appreciate it more. The prequel trilogy films are actually much better than the Disney films. Disney just has all the money in the world in a time with better cgi and technology with a wider range of franchise appeal. When one objectively steps back and takes all the variables into account; one can see that the prequel trilogy is actually better than originally thought and the Disney sequel trilogy is worse than first impressions and The Phantom Menace in particular is the best of the sequel trilogy."
"One of the most underrated movies of cinematic history, a true masterpiece for those who wants more from science fiction than spaceships and aliens."
"One of the most infamous disappointments in movie history, The Phantom Menace is filled with forgettable characters, wooden performances, silly dialogue, and a bland story.  You know you're in trouble when the only character in your movie with any sort of personality is Jar Jar Binks.  But, hey!  At least that pod racing scene was sort of neat."
"Saw this one in the theater in 99 at the age of 28 and loved it.
Recently reviewed it and it's impact was greater with the perspective gained through the years and reflection on the characters introduced way back when the Original Trilogy was released.
So many surprises, so many lessons interpolated into the allegory without seeming preachy. I cry every time seeing the young hero so optimistic, generous and altruistic knowing the where the story of that character that George Lucas conceived will eventually end.
Masterful storytelling, solid performances, excellent cinematography."
Love for the film has grown overtime
Acredito que mesmo com problemas de roteiro como Jar Jar Binks o filme ainda é bom. Me parece uma abordagem mais infantil com computações gráficas revolucionárias para sua época
This movie does not deserve all the hate it gets
"It may have way too much cgi and the most annoying Star Wars character to date, but this movie actually has a pretty darn good story and a very memorable lightsaber sequence, and I would much rather take this then the incoherent Johnson-Abhrams sequels."
Perhaps Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is just lacking cinematic quality or good acting. But is still a peice of histoy because of its inspiration for using Digital instead of Film.
"Pros: I don't like this film but it is still watchable.  I think that Liam Nelson did a great job as Qui Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor did a great job as Obi-Wan because they were the only characters I liked other than Darth Maul in this movie. Darth Maul is a great villain and the final battle between him and Qui Gon Jinn is great and the score is pretty good. While the pod racing scene is dated it is still pretty good. 
Cons: The main Con is Jar Jar and his immature humor that didn't work and got me annoyed. There are many other problems with pacing because even when Jar Jar isn't being annoying this movie can get very boring at times especially during those senate meetings. This also has the prequel problem of bad dialogue and the graphics aren't that great and I don't like the way they made puppet Yoda look before the edited version because he looks hideous. I don't think they should have made Anakin a child because he was an annoying character and he couldn't have a romance with Padme because that would be inappropriate. Obi-Wan and Anakin should have been bonding and should have been friends but they weren't and when they did bond it felt very forced and the Jedi Counsel is like You shouldn't train Anakin but after Qui Gon Jinn's death, the council says train him all of the sudden. I also think Midachlorians are stupid.  I know this is nitpicking but in the pod racing scene, I never liked how there was a child-size helmet because he adults ride those ships. This movie also doesn't feel connected to the Skywalker Saga because all you need to know is that Obi-Wan found Anakin and Anakin made C3PO. I feel like those things make the movie frustrating because without them I would be able to likely give this movie like a (B-).

I don't like this movie but it is watchable and I can sit down and watch it. I'm gonna give this movie a (C-)"
"Gosto da estória. Personagens novos interessantes! Pouco infantil as vezes, mas me agrada!"
"Not the best Star Wars. Some annoying stuff but it's overall very ok. Darth Maul is amazing, his sword is NOT stupid but the way he uses it could be more efficient. Same goes to Obi Wan and Qui Gonn who could have won the fight multiple times in my opinion thanks to their number advantage. Fun to watch"
"A classic star wars movie, and a must see for pop culture knowledge. Really liked it when I was a kid, today not so much. Great memes though."
"I actually liked the kid they got to play young Anakin. However, I didn't like Jar-Jar Binks. I liked the pod race. I didn't like the undeveloped nature of Darth Maul. 

Overall though, it was a fun little movie."
"It quite literally could not be a worse movie. I dare you - go on YouTube and watch some of the fan made Star Wars flicks. They are infinitely better than whatever this flaming waste of film was. The casting is so bad it is comical. It's as though directors do NOTHING to prevent a kid from making a mockery of the film. Public apologies are necessary for this one, but can never undo the damage they brought upon the Star Wars universe. 100% garbage. If you haven't seen it, do everything in your power to never see it. Like the holiday special, it deserves to be forgotten in the dust of history."
"People always say that the scenes on trade friction and senate hearings are the most boring part of the prequels. I think that is one of this movies strongest points, showing how the emperor was able to cripple a well functioning democracy. Other parts of the movie are rich in suspense and introduce the newer characters well in a story that proves vital to shaping their personas. Action scenes one of the best in the entirety of star wars. The only issue is the exposition done by pod-racing. The pod racing scene had potential but was never developed into a complete action scene which makes it seem long and drawn out. All in all a great film and good start to the trilogy."
"With a doubtful script, some unpleasant characters and a plot that does not end wrapping makes The Phantom Menace a very low delivery next to its predecessors where the only thing that saves it is the performances of Neeson, Portman and Mcgregor and some effects and incredible action sequences."
Masterpiece in every way.
great movie just amazing
"this movie is for own children, but i liked it"
"A good way to start off the trilogy, some complained about the politics and that ""it was hard to follow because it's boring"" to me it was actually easy to follow. On a separate note, fans who attacked Jake Lloyd should be ashamed of themselves for attacking a kid back in 1999 Jake Lloyd was fine."
Its interesting to see Anakin's origins and the Darth Maul duel with Obi-wan but beyond that its simply bantha fodder.
"Great action. Awful dialogue. Weak, boring storyline."
"Probably the worst prequel movie because of childishness and Jar Jar, but still good original setup for whole saga."
"I am still baffled at this movie. The only redeeming part of the movie is the score. It is interesting to watch simply to see what happens when George Lucas have full creative control, and it is almost reason enough to watch it. Almost."
"Unlike its predecessors, this movie is devoid of soul and humor. It has the most emotionless acting, almost as if all actors were told not to emote on purpose. Top this off with the character Jar-Jar Binks and young Anakin...well, youve achieved meme fodder. Uggh, painful movie."
"Honestly, it's a really good movie. 
It doesn't deserve nearly any of the flack it gets. Go star wars!"
Its great movie alot of Cgi but that was peak of technology at that time.Iconic lightsaber fight between main heroes.Interesting view on politics.
Boring story and useless dialog. Its a hated movie for a reason. No offense.
"It is an okay start. Not great, but not as bad as everyone is saying. Jar Jar is a huge mistake, yes, but still a good stepping stone for the following movies. AOTC is where the sh*tstorm gets real."
"nice to see anakin, but the storyline is really weak."
"It's quite different to the original movie, but not remotely as bad as people say. It is fun and adds to the Star Wars movies, like with the (now expected) exciting fast paced lightsaber fights"
"Rushed pacing, bad acting from otherwise great actors, bad dialogue. A flop."
The only good part is the fight
"Horrible Thats what it is!
I mean jesus H f*ck what is this?!!
The og trilogy was freaking AWESOME!
And then this comes out?!😕👎"
This movie is great I don't care about the political side it still has good action sequences and a good story.
Okay start for the prequel trilogy with mostly memorable characters. Some good story beats and some not so much.
"A boring story that drudges on, although it has its great points, Darth Maul vs QGJ and Obi Wan may be the best fight in the series, and the pod race is an amazing scene to watch"
"That movie it's complicated, but its a good movie, has some flaws annoying character, but a story with technological innovation for his time and start a saga when a good boy with a lot of hope become more machine, illustrate how life happen with all of us."
Proof that Lucas had no idea what he was doing.  A New Hope & Empire were some of the best sci-fi ever made.  But episodes 1-3 were lousy by comparison.
I love this film because this is the first Star Wars movie growing up as a kid and when I watched it again I still love it.
Too much about politics.
People complain about everything . This is a good movie. The only real problem with the movie is that they did not use Darth maul to his full potential . Be seemed like a minor character in the story when he should've been the biggest conflict in the movie .Not perfect at all but way better than the tfa - rise of Skywalker.
A pony tail guy that looks like he works at a used cd store runs around knocking over hobby horses with legs. He meets a child who drag races and will grow up to commit atrocities because he fell in love.
It was good but comparing it to the other ones it wasn't the best
Amazing I love this film <3
"The movie is very slow in the middle, but the first and last half hour, and the podracer sequence all hold up. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not the worst star wars movie either"
"Really good movie, like all 6 of the originals! Fuck the new ones though."
"The Phantom Menace is the movie with which I entered the Star Wars Universe. My adult eye sees better why so many people were upset with it, but in my opinion, it was a fun movie. Jar Jar voice was certainly annoying, but the introduction of characters like Qui-Gon Jinn and Mace Windu was great. I agree that there was too much politics for young viewers, while the originals were driven by fast-paced action, but TFM also introduced what was probably the best light saber fight in a Star Wars movie, enhanced by it's glorious soundtrack. As itself, TFM ins't a bad movie in my opinion. It has many flaws, but also its moments of greatness."
GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
Really good movie first Star Wars movie I ever saw when I was little. 👍🏻🙂
Now to be fair I am a very biased when it comes to this movie. It was the first Star Wars movie ever song theaters and I thought Darth Maul was totally amazing now that I'm older I can see that it has major flaws pretty much across-the-board still a fantastic movie will always have a special place in my heart.
"Better than it's given credit for. A fitting beginning for Anakin's story. A grand adventure film. Just enjoy it for what it is, a fun film. I mean it only introduced Qui Gon, Darth Maul, & Mace Mindu. Want else do you people want?!?"
I was scared to watch this movie again because of Jar jar but he is indeed just visible on their first trip to Naboo. Then Jar Jar is inexistent and the film adopts a darker tone that pays homage to A New Hope. THe universe is well establisged and i infeed laughed quite some time at Jar jar's comic reliefs. A very good surprise! The special effevts are too old but this film tried to show things at the limits of conema at this time. Well done Lucas
"This is a terrible, terrible movie. I'm amazed that A) Lucas made a film like this, knowing how beloved the franchise was, and B) that the franchise remained so beloved after this had come out... It introduced Maul though, who is my favourite Star Wars character. So points on that one."
"The story was something fitting for a prequel to the Star Wars trilogy, but god, get Jar Jar out of that."
"Bogged down by callus acting and a convoluted plot, The Phantom Menace leaves you wanting more from Star Wars especially after a fun action packed third act."
"I haven't seen Phantom Menace in years and I re-watched it today. Honestly, I thought it was great. The plot was interesting - lot of exciting moments throughout the movie. I actually thought the acting, in general, was good - I thought all the actors were good and I enjoyed Jar-Jar Binks - I found him to be great comic relief. There were some scenes that were a bit unconvincing - like the vote of no-confidence scene seemed rather rushed, though it was already quite a long movie. I felt like there were no truly boring moments in the movie. The soundtrack is awesome. Also, I've seen worse movies get better critic reviews - I don't really understand why critics hated the movie so much. The Disney rendition of Star Wars, in comparison, is a complete disservice to Star Wars lore - nothing makes sense in consideration of the Star Wars Universe and the previous Star Wars reality. What was previously a very deep film essentially was transformed into something else entirely."
A generous and soulful blockbuster. The third act is amazing.
"Fun to watch, I wouldn't call it good. Until Adolf Disney took over, this was probably the poorest of the saga. It was made in the 90s though so can't really blame Lucas.
Also, I always felt like some things from this could have been added to Attack of the Clones, and there could have been a movie between AotC and RotS, and this movie could have been scrapped without taking away from the story"
I think the phantom menace isn't terrible like most think I also don't think it was a great movie either but it was the first time we saw some interesting battles and didn't look that bad and introduce the characters but they could have avoided alot of bad things that happend in the movie overall.
Ehhh.......pretty lacking. Disappointment of a movie. Didn't have the fast action the originals had. This ranks probably number eight from worst to best on my list. I will put my final rankings in the rise of Skywalker review.
"5.5/10. This is a film of two extremes - a triumph of the technical aspects of film making, yet a failure in story telling. The costumes and set pieces mesh seamlessly with the special effects (for 1998, but even still today it didn't look awful), and a typically outstanding John Williams score works with these elements to transport viewers out of their living rooms and across the galaxy. The action - particularly the podrace and final lightsaber dueling - is thrilling, even as the abysmal script, annoying or bland characters, and poor acting to match (which is a shame given the talents of the cast) threaten to waste all of the technical wizardry. While George Lucas has a knack for developing the foundations of a lush sci-fi universe, he'd have been better off leaving the finer points of directing and writing to others. The StarWars franchise would be much better served for it."
"Good Stuff: The pod race, younger obi-wan, Darth f-ing Maul, the lightsaber duel, The action, The music, One of the best star wars endings, no joke, it's actually good, The Planets, the fish chase scene.

Bad Stuff: The Plot, JarJar at times."
"stick around for the pod race and the lightsaber fights, they are so worth it. the parts in between are pretty dumb though."
"This is a fun movie, that just doesn't tell a super compelling story. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are great, and Maul is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars Universe. Jar-Jar, Congress, and low levels of action plague the film, but when the story really moves as it does in the beginning and end, it's quite good."
"After watching Disney rubbish movie. This is really a damm good movie. At least the lightsaber fight was damn good. At least the story make sense. At least Qui Qon Ginn and Obiwan was really convincing. At least the space fight is really good. At least the storm troopers die. At least Jedi(s) are powerful but they still die. And all Jedi(s) has their strength and weakness, they each have different roles and is very clearly shown in the movie. Disney's Star Wars is... plotless, illogical, breaks all physics, no continuity from previous 6 movies (plus Rogue One). No idea why Rey Space Jesus was ever needed to go through 3 movies when she could single handedly just destroy the entire Universe in the first 5 mins of the film. She can literally do anything. Teleport, heal people, bring dead people back to life, do Jedi mind trick, lift entire mountain range basically just do everything and anything she wants. Disney Star Wars is... just wasting people's time, it's rubbish. Its not inspiring and its almost just illogical (poor) action. Even the action sequence is BAD... REALLY BAD. I give George Lucas  STAR WARS 10 out of 5 stars. For being logical, consistent and good fight sequence."
Superb. Good starting. Star Wars is amazing ♥️
"The most forgettable Star Wars, and the worst George Lucas had to offer"
A movie that 2 and 1/2 stars is generous. By far the worst Star Wars movie.
Still better than the sequel trilogy.
Darth Maul... saves this movie.
"A fantastic children's movie, with great special effects, moral lessons, and a great story. While imperfect there are few movies out there that really spark the imagination and give the young a chance to visit such a rich, fantasy world."
"Uneventful and unmemorable, with a cast of characters that are not that interesting. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is boring in this and Liam Neeson as his mentor seems be going through the motions. But it's all mildly watchable, with some moments giving us the kick that was lacking."
"Jar jar binks is the main reason why the score is so low. He makes this movie almost insufferable. But beside that the movie is actually decent, with interesting characters and alright story which is a bit plagued by the prequel curse since we know for the most part what will happen. However It is a decent watch for star wars fans and perhaps while as not as good as the previous films, it is a good stepping stone (minus jar jar) towards the prequel trilogy."
"I only recommend this as Phantom Edit version. Otherwise it will bum you out. This movie has only one problem, it is Jar Jar Binks. Everything else is really amazing, but Jar Jar is in 70% of the film, so you NEED Phantom Edit version."
"Honestly after rewatching the movie I realized how great this film is the pod racing scene is fantastic the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and the final battle between Qui-gon, Obi-wan, and Darth Maul is amazing especially with Duel of the Fates playing in the back is amazing"
Star wars is always fun but jarjar was annoying. Love to watch with my kiddo
"Not as strong as the original series, but better than episodes 8 and 9."
Boring to watch and no good qualities
Darth Maul almost takes it to a good action movie. Should have been Darth Jar Jar
"This movie was absolute crap. A total embarrassment - amateur acting from good actors, terrible plot, awful script."
I actually like this movie although I understand why people hate it. The Last Jedi and parts of Rise of Skywalker actually made me appreciate this movie even more than I already did.
"Some of the characters were poorly chosen and portrayed, but if you are looking for a decent story with detail and a bit of action, this is the film for you."
"After years without a new Star Wars movie this was a great film to begin the next trilogy! Incredible visuals, sound affects, music, acting, fight scenes, and much more!"
The worst film from the whole saga to my taste. Boring plot with annoying characters and bad acting.
"It was a stupid, bad, boring mess of a movie with bad CGI and bland characters."
"Most likely the worst star wars movie to date. It is littered with plot holes and is slightly boring. Despite this, it does have some redeeming qualities."
Ray parks saved this movie
"I liked this movie, it is not bad as everyone sais it is."
"Characters are dope, script sucks though."
"Most people don't appreciate this movie, but I still say it is a good prequel. Lucasfilm may have gone a bit better with this, but they did a good job. The characters are interesting, especially Jar Jar Binx, however Anakin is so young it does keep away from the story a bit. The pod racing scene is drawn out, as is the middle of the movie. However, though the story is a tad bit confusing, once you wrap your head around it, you are engrossed to see what happens."
"While silly and outlandish with some of it's risks, plus unconvincing acting and boring dialogue, this movie is action and Star Wars fun in many parts! Cool villain, astonishingly action entertaining sequences, and one of the best light saber fights of the saga make this movie just entertaining enough."
"Lucas messed up. Big time. Your only saving grace were Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Ray Park (Darth Maul). Otherwise, its terrible"
"It's easy to scold the original George Lucas prequel, but what can you praise it for? Definitely for the choreography of lightsaber fighting scenes. For some new curious characters. To the midichlorians, which I personally think is a good idea. But anyway, these two and a half pluses will never be able to resist the avalanche of shortcomings of the film, the main of which are a waste of screen time, poor CGI, replacing the practical effects native to the heart, neutered action and more than ever boring script, proving that the franchise could really exist without the first episode."
Too deep for this Time.
I saw this 12 times in the theater with my then girlfriend. It's amazing the stuff I put her through.
The worst movie I have ever seen
"With the first prequel to the first Star Wars Saga, it falls short with boring introductions to characters and story, but at least offers some impressive action set pieces from the Pod Race on Tatooine to the climatic light saber fight with Darth Maul. Not the best way to start a series but not really the absolute worst way to~"
A comedy of a movie
"It was bad, possibly the worst Star Wars film. It is mostly skippable."
"Loved it.  Of the prequels, I thought it was the best."
I thought it was kinda a waste of a very good villain I do like the back story of anikan feels like a mediocre movie
"Amazing visual, battles and characters, including Jar Jar!"
"Not at all what fans wanted and that is part of the problem. One of them being how Anakin saves the day out of a ""fluke"". However it does get better every time you watch it. I'm not one of those who ever disliked this movie and I now I think it's really good."
Garbage. Should be remade.
"Pretty good story. Atmosphere was at times like it should be in Star wars movies. Could give half star more if without jar jar, animated characters was childish, Anakin's spacebattle was little bit too mutch. I will miss Liam Neeson."
I know that this film hasn't aged well but I grew up with the prequel trilogy and they were absolutely amazing. I don't think they deserve the full hate that they get. The best part of this film for me was always the end lightsaber duel of fates. Great memories as a kid
"Alles in diesem Film, außer Qui Gon, Darth Maul Lichtschwert Kampf und John Williams Music ist Schlecht und Kindisch"
fantastic. if you love star wars you will love this.
Jar Jar Binks. Nuff said
"Boring, confusing but saved by the bell. I could not describe the plot of this movie to anyone who has or hasn't seen this movie. The scenes besides the pod racing and final duel are completely forgettable and boring. There isn't any chemistry between the characters and they don't help drive the plot forward. You are asleep until you realize it is almost the end with the amazing duel between our main protagonists and antagonist. Without this scene, there would be no question within the fandom that this is a BAD movie. Worth a try for those scenes but skip it if you want to get straight to the real Star Wars treat."
Would’ve been 5 Stars if Jar Jar Binks wasn’t in it.
"Worst, most horrible Star Wars movie ever."
"I would definitely recommend it. 

Jedi master Qui Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are great characters to add to the saga. 

Midichlorians story was really unnecessary, felt like narrowed the meaning of force."
It's Star Wars so 5 stars
though many people don't like this film I think its amazing and should be hold in high regards
Saw it the other day again and it’s always been my least favorite but I like it more now
"THIS JUST FEELS LIKE STAR WARS.  THE STORY IS GREAT, ACTING AND JUST ENJOYABLE TO WATCH.  THESE ARE MY CHILDHOOD AND STARTED MY STAR WARS FANDOM."
"Some interesting ideas and visuals, but it lost sight of what made the original Star Wars films special. Amazing score by John Williams."
Characters are for the most part wooden but does a good job expanding upon the force without destroying it. Ending fight is very entertaining.
They could have done with out Jar Jar. Overall was not to bad.
The Darth Maul duel is one of the best in the whole series.
"Drags on, quite boring and uninteresting. It's story can be summed up as follows: Anakin is found by Liam Neeson. Anakin meets Padmé. Liam Neeson dies by Darth Maul's hand and Obi Won Kenobi defeats Darth Maul. Nothing else in the movie is relevant to the overall story. Duel of the Fates and the Pod Racing are the best parts of the movie."
"Maybe it's because I saw it at 14, but I didn't have it!"
"While Jar Jar can be quite an odd character and somewhat annoying, and the whole Pod Racing part could be removed and you lose nothing to do with the plot, this movie perfectly begins the trilogy of how Palpatine manipulated the force and Anakin into destroying the republic.

Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but definitely a great movie."
"Achei legal, ele é um ótimo filme para se começar se conhecer a franquia, claro. Na minha opinião."
"A lot went wrong with this film. After coming out of the original trilogy there was a lot of weight on this movies shoulders but unfortunately they didn't succeed. Im going to start off with the good first. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are both great in their roles however McGregor still wasn't used to George Lucas' lines. Darth Maul is a fantastic villain and gives off a menacing presence while only delivering a few lines in the whole movie. The fight scenes were improved significantly from the OT as the final lightsaber duel in this film is the best ever and it is only made more awesome by having John Williams' amazing Duel Of The Fates track playing in the background. The Visuals, although not aged well, were great for the time and were revolutionary. Where the film fails is with the rest of the characters. They are all so bland, uninteresting and just downright annoying (Anakin and Jar Jar) and it doesn't help that the actors had trouble delivering Lucas' lines which is another problem with the film, the dialogue, the dialogue is incredibly bad it's surprising that they were written by the same person who did Empire Strikes Back. The Plot is fine for the most part except for a few subplots that dragged the film. Overall this film is a massive downgrade from the OT however it is far from the worst Star Wars film. I give this movie a 5/10."
I am sorry but i loved all of it
Good solid movie. lacking in areas
could be better. Though the lightsaber battles were something else.
Great Star Wars movie
"Easily the weakest of the Star Wars films, this movie is a chaotic mess that somehow manages to be boring for the vast majority of its 133 minute run time. The final showdown between Maul, Obi Wan, and Qui Gon remains perhaps the best lightsaber duel in the entire series, but it can't save this boring trainwreck of a film. The characters are flat, the dialogue is horrid, the movie does little to no work to set up the films it supposedly serves as a prequel to, and the plot is mostly about trade embargoes for some reason. Watch this movie for the music and the memes and nothing else."
Was great seeing Jedi on the big screen again. Idk about the whole Jar Jar idea.
"While it was fun in parts, it suffers in pacing and immersion for myself. It expands the galaxy the franchise takes place in, and on its own it is not the worst experience. However the movies before and following it put it in its place as one of the less engaging of the franchise."
You must unlearn what you have learned.
"Growing up with the original trilogy, and watching this trilogy was a resounding disappointment. This was the beginning of the downfall of Lucas. The special effects looked bubbly and cartoonish. It completely lacked the feel of the original movies. The vehicles looked more advanced/elegant that the original movies, and that doesn't make any sense because they were prequels. The acting was some of the worst I'd ever seen in a major motion picture. Surely technology advanced. The one saving grace for this trilogy was the incredible acting for the famous character Obi-Wan. Sam Neeson was incredible throughout.

The first of the trilogy is by far the worst thing released in the Star Wars Franchise, and is barely reminiscent of the Star Wars Universe."
Love the theme of fate in this movie
"Yes, Jar Jar is weird and stupid. But, this movie has the best lightsaber fights!"
Slow start and pretty much carried by Dual of the Fates.
2nd least favorite star wars movie(solo is my least favorite)
Duel of the Fates is all I need to say.
"An absolutely fascinating story from beloved Star Wars' creator, George Lucas. A great flow and easy to follow plot. An amazing origin story for the saga we all love"
"The phantom menace doesn't give the fans what they wanted, it is far away of the original saga, but it has astonishing scenes that makes it better."
movie is much better then what people give credit for...
Awesome is an understatement
"The worst prequel, but it still is the best possible introduction to  the franchise"
This was not only a disaster but due to its lack of connection to 2 and 3 a very unneeded disaster full of boring charcters huge plot holes and missed opportunity
"This is the first Star Wars movie I ever saw. I love the podracing. I love Darth Maul's introduction. I love Palpatine's initial rise to power. The battles at the end are spectacular and go on with seemingly no end; which, I personally love. Jar Jar made me laugh as a kid, and I love the underwater sequence. Qui-Gon Jinn is a rare glimpse at a Jedi Master who went against the council and did his own thing. The special effects rock and 90% still look amazing. Overall, this is not my favorite Star Wars film, but it is up there as a classic for me."
"As a true fan of the saga, this film upset me a bit, however, I am a fan and this film had many brilliant moments."
"Great cast, great scenario, great venture into the galaxy far far away!"
The movie that sparked my love for Star Wars. Is it perfect? No. Did I enjoy watching it as a kid and still do so today? Hell Yeah
"Awesome, the only conplaints about the film i have is the scenes on tatooiene( minus the pod race) abd a couple of performances, everything else is great especially the final lightsaber fight"
"A dream-like zen experience. Strange, interesting, and also profoundly boring. It's the least 'Star Wars-y' Star Wars film, but also the most 'George Lucas-y' one.
Duel of the Fates to this day is incredible, and probably what saves this movie."
"While not the greatest star wars movie ever made, it's positives outweigh its negatives. Jar Jar is a the biggest negative but even he shines sometimes and the final fight scenes make one forget all of the bad, especially with duel of the fates playing."
Best star wars music and battle. The jedi council and temple idea was awesome
Better then rise of skywalker
"Yikes, this one is so bad that I think I fell asleep the first time I saw it."
"Let me tell you something. Star Wars Episode One is one of the hardest films to talk about. The reason: Everything that has been put into by George Lucas. The screenplay focuses on politics rather than action, the visuals were bland, and some of the characters were stereotyped like the aliens who represent the CIS. Let's not mention Jar Jar Binks please. On a positive note, Darth Maul was an interesting character with little dialogue and Ewan McGregor is perfect as Obi-Wan. Overall, The Phantom Menace was just a film with some good and bad ideas from the start."
It is way to underrated and compared to the sequels it is a masterpiece
Lots to like even with Jar Jar.
I loved it as a kid but not so much now
Have bad dialogues but in some point tell a consistent story a we can see where everything begin
"Better than Attack of the Clones. A much more consistent movie compared to the other prequels, with a few boring bits in between."
Not as bad as the hate. I love young Anakin and the pod racing scene.
"It's really the perfect beginning for Star Wars. It has all the light and the dark anyone could ask for, and lays the complex groundwork for future episodes expertly. That which is great has small beginnings, and the impatient are missing much here."
Just watch the movie and try not to laugh. Comedic gold. Midochlorians - Genius
"The main porpuse of this movie it's showing us the little Anakin, and begins of the Darth Side with Sidius and Maul."
"Disappointing, yet entertaining, and not the worst movie in the franchise."
"Es lenta pero disfrutable, lo que hace perfecto es la introducción de nuevos planetas, personajes y especies sin descuidar su esencia. Las escenas finales lo mejor"
"I loved this film, I don't care what people say it was great."
"George Lucas seems to have completely forgotten that in 1999, most diehard Star Wars fans were NOT 12 year olds but grown ups who wanted a bit more brains into ""The Phantom Menace"". For a movie aimed at ""kids"", its contrived plot about a scheming trade federation and a separatist movement within the republic seems utterly out of place. The contradictions with the original trilogy abound. Example? In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Obi Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker in a vision that he should go to the Dagobah system, to learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed him. Are you sure Ben?!?!? In this movie, it's not Yoda but Qui Gon Jin who instructs Kenobi. Only after Qui Gon dies does Yoda take matters into his hands, but we never see him ""instruct"" ANYTHING to Obi Wan, who's already quite self sufficient as a Jedi knight. Why was Qui Gon ""forgotten"" in the original trilogy? ""The Phantom Menace"" happens 20 years BEFORE the events on ""A New Hope"". If so, why do we see technology FAR superior than the one in the Original Trilogy?!?!? Why do we see R2-D2 do things we thought were impossible in this movie? Surely he could've used the same tricks in ""A New Hope"", but those ""special gadgets"" were never called upon. I understand that Lucas had way more resources to put on an amazing movie, but he went overboard, specially with his heavy handed use of CGI. At times, ""The Phantom Menace"" feels more like watching a modern video game, not a movie. 
And the acting! Having the talents of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did little to hide the cringe worthy dialogue. Sure, everyone hated Jar Jar Binks. If only his screen time could've been edited down it would've been fine, but what's even MORE grating was Anakin. Instead of showing us some brooding 10 year old, we get a happy-go-lucky kid who somehow ends up being the meanest Sith Lord in the galaxy! And that midiclorian mumbo jumbo trying to explain the power of the force in biological terms was uncalled for. 
If ""The Phantom Menace"" shaped your childhood and turned you into a Star Wars fan, then that's this movie's sole saving grace... and John Williams always spot-on, rousing score. The movie's most interesting character, Darth Maul, was disposed of in minutes, a wasted opportunity to develop a far more interesting film. 
When people tell me that ""The Last Jedi"" is worst than asbestos, I bet they hold ""Menace""'dear to their hearts. 
I saw it at the movie theater, I've seen it many, many times at home, first on VHS, then on DVD and now on Bluray, but the feeling is the same: not good.
While ultimately offering shallow entertainment, ""The Phantom Menace"" still is my LEAST favorite Star Wars movie and the one that gave all the prequels a really bad name (""Attack Of The Clones"" was slightly better)."
"Pretty decent, but could be better."
The Phantom Menace is not the worst Star Wars it is just ok it feels so long and sadly introduced Jar Jar........
Nice characters and world building. But bad story telling.
its good stop the Bullshit
Episode one has the best light saber battle in the entire saga.
"Given the proper time to deeply analyze, this movie was a great start to the era that made the Star Wars Galaxy feel like the expansive galaxy it is."
"It's Star Wars but it isn't. It has the dazzling and sometimes ground breaking visual effects but lacks the heart of the Original Trilogy. It feels a bit paint by number which leads to a lack of connection with the lead characters. And that's before we even mention the horror that is Jar Jar Binks. 

It still has its highlights. The lightsaber battles were better than anything in the original movies. It sits nicely as a really solid kids movie in the end."
Way to much bad CGI and Jar Jar Binks... but Darth Maul was awesome
"Всю картину портят нелепые шутки, и превращение фильма в детское. Совсем ненужный персонаж - Джа Джа Бинкс. Уж лучше бы дерево какое-нибудь привело героев в подводный мир, чем эта карикатурная жаба"
"This is not the best Star Wars film, but this is the one that I have seen the most by a long shot. I feel like Disney should redo the CGI in the prequels and bring it up to 2019 standards, which would go a long way towards making each of those films better.

The dialogue and acting in the Phantom Menace is not as bad as the dialogue and acting in Attack of the Clones, and unlike Solo or The Last Jedi, Phantom Menace still feels like a Star Wars film. 

Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give great performances, Darth Maul is perhaps the coolest Star Wars villain, Yoda gives some of the best wisdom he ever gives, podracing is a cool concept, the Obi-Qui-Maul lightsaber duel is perhaps the best in the series, and Duel of the Fates is the best Star Wars song. In all, there is a lot to love about this film, even if Jar Jar is a ridiculous character, the CGI looks bad now, and the politics can be a bit boring.

My Review: C+"
It's a wonderful adventure!
Bad when it came out but puts the Rian Johnson Star Wars movies you shame. Barring Rogue One and Solo.
Star Wars The Phantom Menace was a great beginning of the skywalker saga
"Decent not terrible, could have been better"
"I cannot for the life of me, figure out why people hate this movie so much. Especially in light of episodes 7-9! 
ok, midichlorians are kinda dumb, but can be explained as just a biomarker of the force as is done in the extended universe. 
Ok, Jar Jar is annoying, but just a goofy character that Lucas took a risk on and it didn't work. 
Ok, Anakin is a little annoying,,,but that makes sense. He is destined to become the most powerful person in the galaxy... he's probably going to be a little annoying. 
But come on! Pod races! Darth Mall! Qui-Gon! Excellent characters and visual effects. A complicated, but SUPER interesting plot. If you didn't like this movie on the first view, please, go back and rewatch it. Try to get over your JarJar Phobia and learn to love something wonderful. This is the first glimpse into a grand high society,  on the verge of collapse! Lucas world building at it's finest."
"""I don't like sand. It's coarse and it gets everywhere."" - Anakin Skywalker

Well you know what Anakin, I feel the same way about you. The perfect way to summarize this movie is that you only watch it for the battle of Geonosis and even that segment was underwhelming."
"This movie is actually better than people remember it. 
Go watch it again. 
Now that you have more to compare it to, you'll realise it's alright. 
Sure, Jar Jar is ridiculous, and Anakin as a boy is arrogant and annoying, but this movie had the best light saber fighting, great world building, introduction to characters like Obi Wan and Padme etc.... 
This movie is better than people give it credit for. it's almost like it's fashionable to hate it."
"only thing good about this was Maul, and he died too quickly. Kid was annoying, plot complete trash. Jar Jar."
"This movie had all the resources to be a great movie but fell flat on it's face. The poor dialogue, the cheesy cgi charecterals, poor storyline and bad pacing. I did like battle scenes but there was very few, but by far the most annoying thing is the movie is marketed towards children but is 80 percent politics."
Its story not so good; but Darth maul brought it back up
Opened up great possibilities for expanded universe.
"The first quarter of the film is Star Wars. As it drags on, it just gets worse, and worse, and worse. Then at the very end, Darth Maul saves the movie. It's ok, not bad or good, just that. 2.5 out of 5"
"Well not the best movie to start off the Prequel Trilogy, but I did enjoy some of the action scenes that were great."
A society that chooses Disney's tripe over this is domed to fall like the Old Republic.
I't is okay but the story telling is slow and boring
The movie is ok but the 2nd worst star wars movie I love the battle scenes and the different planets. The main problem is the dialog it's very corny sure it's fine in some scenes. 2nd problem are the Characters Jar Jar and Young Anakin😑 There is a balance from bad dialog to awesome battle scenes but you still want to watch it. My top 8 star wars movies are #8 star wars #7 star wars 1 #6 star wars 2 #5 star wars 3 #4 star wars 7 #3 star wars 4 #2 star wars 6 #1 star wars 5. Star wars 9 I will watch it soon and it might be garbage.
I give the same rating to Episode I and II. Just bad acting and dialogue all over the place.
"I recently rewatched The Phantom Menace to gear up for The Last Jedi and it struck me how much of a better movie this would have been without Jar Jar Binks. I hope/think this is a lesson about ""comic"" relief (I use that term loosely) for filmmakers. The great talents of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are completely wasted on this origin story. I think we, and Lucas, have learned that origin stories don't have to feel like homework - just setting up the future stories. Qui-Gon Jinn could have been such an epic character - a rebel following the force, even though the dark consequences of his actions, but instead the story and dialogue are so wooden - purely putting in the work to set up the rest of the story. 
There are some good visual effects and the first double bladed lightsaber and I suppose it's a must-watch if you want to be faithful to the Star Wars Saga - and, obviously, you should be, but it's severely lacking the joy and thrill brought on by the  original trilogy."
"I personally didn't like anything. Not even the music, the action sequences, nothing."
It has aged well with the passing of time.
"Some fun set pieces, but yousa missed the mark here."
Some flaws but still amazing.
To much dialogue too little fun.
"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was the first movie I ever saw in theaters. My father had been a lifelong super fan of the series since seeing the original on the day after opening night. Honestly I don't remember much of that original viewing, I was very young. Only a scattered haze of podracing and lightsaber action. But as I grew older I saw this movie and eventually understood it. My opinions are probably your opinions, this movie was not the masterpiece everyone was expecting, it felt nothing like the original trilogy, it was childish, dumb, and sometimes even offensive. I agree, on all those points, and as a complete lover of Star Wars I find even more fault in it. But, I do still think there is some good to be found here. Even over 20 years later a lot of the action and effects still look great. The score by John Williams is just as good as originals and even better in some ways. Ewan McGregor's young Obi-Wan Kenobi is used sparingly in this movie, but shines whenever he is on screen. The podracing sequence, while part of a long detour in the movie, is still edge of your seat. No matter how many times you have seen it. The fantastic climatic lightsaber fight is considered one of the best in the series for a good reason. There is a lot to love and hate about this movie. But ultimately I wish it had just given me a bit more to love.   -Rhenn"
"The story isn't the best of the Star Wars saga, the story's goes at a good pace but when it gets to tatooine its just slows a bit and when it gets to the pod racing scene (which I do like watching) it is visually stunning (at the time) but all a sudden it SLOWS down when the politics start being involved. The ending fight against Darth Maul is great along with John Williams being on top of his game with the music... Duel of the fates is some of the greatest piece of music ever. Buuuuuuuuuut the script at times is very bad and cringe to listen to, especially with Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin. But I not blaming the acting of Jake Lloyd  cause its wasn't his fault. It has some memorable moments but it does have pacing, scripting  issues, but it is not the worst Star Wars film out there."
"I saw this movie when I was 17, I grew up on the trilogy.

I thought it was a good movie and still enjoy watching it."
Possibly the greatest Star Wars movie ever made..
"If it were the first ""Star Wars"" movie, ""The Phantom Menace"" would be hailed as a visionary breakthrough. But this is the fourth movie of the famous series, and we think we know the territory; many of the early reviews have been blase, paying lip service to the visuals and wondering why the characters aren't better developed. How quickly do we grow accustomed to wonders. I am reminded of the Isaac Asimov story ""Nightfall,"" about the planet where the stars were visible only once in a thousand years. So awesome was the sight that it drove men mad. We who can see the stars every night glance up casually at the cosmos and then quickly down again, searching for a Dairy Queen.

""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,"" to cite its full title, is an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking. If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable: This is the first story in the chronology and has to set up characters who (we already know) will become more interesting with the passage of time. Here we first see Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and R2-D2 and C-3PO. Anakin is only a fresh-faced kid in Episode I; in IV, V and VI, he has become Darth Vader.

At the risk of offending devotees of the Force, I will say that the stories of the ""Star Wars"" movies have always been space operas, and that the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. I do not attend with the hope of gaining insights into human behavior. Unlike many movies, these are made to be looked at more than listened to, and George Lucas and his collaborators have filled ""The Phantom Menace"" with wonderful visuals.

There are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls, and speakers floating on pods in the center. And other places: the cityscape with the waterfall that has a dizzying descent through space. And the other cities: one city Venetian, with canals, another looking like a hothouse version of imperial Rome, and a third that seems to have grown out of desert sands.

Set against awesome backdrops, the characters in ""The Phantom Menace"" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.

The plot details (of embargoes and blockades) tend to diminish the size of the movie's universe--to shrink it to the scale of a 19th century trade dispute. The stars themselves are little more than pinpoints on a black curtain, and ""Star Wars"" has not drawn inspiration from the color photographs being captured by the Hubble Telescope. The series is essentially human mythology, set in space, but not occupying it. If Stanley Kubrick gave us man humbled by the universe, Lucas gives us the universe domesticated by man. His aliens are really just humans in odd skins. For ""The Phantom Menace,"" he introduces Jar Jar Binks, a fully realized computer-animated alien character whose physical movements seem based on afterthoughts. And Jabba the Hutt (who presides over the Podrace) has always seemed positively Dickensian to me.

Yet within the rules he has established, Lucas tells a good story. The key development in ""Phantom"" is the first meeting between the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd)--who is, the Jedi immediately senses, fated for great things. Qui-Gon meets Anakin in a store where he's seeking replacement parts for his crippled ship. Qui-Gon soon finds himself backing the young slave in a high-speed Podrace--betting his ship itself against the cost of the replacement parts. The race is one of the film's high points, as the entrants zoom between high cliff walls in a refinement of a similar race through metal canyons on a spaceship in ""Star Wars."" Why is Qui-Gon so confident that Anakin can win? Because he senses an unusual concentration of the Force--and perhaps because, like John the Baptist, he instinctively recognizes the one whose way he is destined to prepare. The film's shakiness on the psychological level is evident, however, in the scene where young Anakin is told he must leave his mother (Pernilla August) and follow this tall Jedi stranger. Their mutual resignation to the parting seems awfully restrained. I expected a tearful scene of parting between mother and child, but the best we get is when Anakin asks if his mother can come along, and she replies, ""Son, my place is here."" As a slave? The discovery and testing of Anakin supplies the film's most important action, but in a sense all the action is equally important, because it provides platforms for special-effects sequences. Sometimes our common sense undermines a sequence (for instance, when Jar Jar's people and the good guys fight a 'droid army, it becomes obvious that the droids are such bad fighters, they should be returned for a refund). But mostly I was happy to drink in the sights on the screen, in the same spirit that I might enjoy ""Metropolis,"" ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Dark City"" or ""The Matrix."" The difference is that Lucas' visuals are more fanciful and his film's energy level is more cheerful; he doesn't share the prevailing view that the future is a dark and lonely place.

What he does have, in abundance, is exhilaration. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of ""The Phantom Menace,"" as he tries out new effects and ideas, and seamlessly integrates real characters and digital ones, real landscapes and imaginary places. We are standing at the threshold of a new age of epic cinema, I think, in which digital techniques mean that budgets will no longer limit the scope of scenes; filmmakers will be able to show us just about anything they can imagine.

As surely as Anakin Skywalker points the way into the future of ""Star Wars,"" so does ""The Phantom Menace"" raise the curtain on this new freedom for filmmakers. And it's a lot of fun. The film has correctly been given the PG rating; it's suitable for younger viewers and doesn't depend on violence for its effects. As for the bad rap about the characters--hey, I've seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. They're called ""Star Trek"" movies. Give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day."
Greatest piece of fiction ever created.
Kickass. way better then the last jedi
Its an ok film not the worst Star Wars film. If you like Star Wars you will enjoy it.
The Skywalker Saga Begins!
"The action was great, how ever the plot was not great. I think a must see star wars movie."
My favorite star wars. I wish the new ones followed the same path b
Loved it! Visually stunning with a great story and probably the best sound score of the series.
Many people were pumped for this movie and it had been a huge disappointment. This movie is putting so much complicated politics into a kid's movie. Pretty bad CGI and Jar Jar was just there for the comic relief. fine actors and bad writing. Like I don't know why this film has to be the first Star Wars film. Just stick with the original trilogy.
"I don't know what happened to George Lucas. But this movie felt like a lazy reboot to Star Wars. You can't tell who is the main character. Jar Jar Binks is just a joke machine. There is no character arc. Obi-Wan feels like an accessory to Qui-gon. The CGI feels too fake, the original trilogy placed real life objects to make it real. Why is there politics in a kids movie. Now I know I am just pointing out the flaws. To be fair the movie did well on Anakin's chemistry with his mom. Anakin's chemistry was good with the Queen, but not as love interest. I mean she is too old to bang him."
"Way back in 1999 the hype for this movie was unreal. It had been sixteen years since the release of the last Star Wars film and the buzz for this movie reached heights no other film ever had before. I feel sorry for the people who waited so long for this movie. It’s a mess, with a stupid nonsensical plot, and wooden characters. It’s hard to believe something this dry and bland came from the same man who created the universe this movie is set in. Call it nostalgia, call it over hype. This movie has no magic or grace of the previous three movies."
incredibly enjoyable. amazing fight scenes and approximately 99999999 times better than the last jedi in every aspect other than the cgi being a bit older now
"To be honest, this movie is better than I remember. It's certainly not the best movie in the franchise, and the whole trade war is way too complex and unnecessary, but this movie sets up a lot. It begins Palpatine's takeover of the Senate and it introduces Anakin and his fear, at least. It's necessary to watch if you want to get into Star Wars, but is not a fantastic movie."
Can't see why people didn't like it?
"An ok Star Wars movie, specially for kids."
"I hadn't seen it in a long time and it's better than I remembered it being. Maul is great, the action is great and I really didn't mind young Anakin. The two stars off are because I still can't believe that George thought that this political action movie would appeal to kids at all. Even after just watching it, it's still crazy to me that the whole plot revolved around a queen deciding whether or not to sign a trade agreement."
theres always a bigger fish
"It's the weakest of the franchise, is slower than the other installments and at times drags, and some of the effects have aged TERRIBLY.  At the same time, it still manages to be a largely fun and fantastically plotted sci-fi political thriller that introduces us to the boy who will become Vader."
"Movie gets better with time. The dialogue with Padme and Anakin loses it a star, but the overall plot is excellent."
It was a very bad prequel to the amazing Trilogy.
"Underrated, at least there's a real backstory and characters, something that can't be said for the most recent trilogy"
"I really like this movie because it shows how it all started, and many don't like the idea of George Lucas being the director of this movie, but I think it's a great job with a good story, apart from the fact that there is Jar Jar this movie is very good."
Now THIS is PODRACING!!!!
I like it. I do not dislike what the general consensus does. Jar Jar Binks is just Jar Jar Binks. I am a fan of Obi Wan and Darth Maul.
What a great way to kick-off the saga. This movie is filled with beautiful details and submerges you deep in the Star Wars Universe. The pod-race scene was exhilarating in the theater.
"Hmmm, some fantastic new characters but badly let down by Jar Jar Binks and some dodgy dialogue. Quite good tho."
"Even though this movies has amazing actors, they all are at the bottom of their games. This movie has terrible acting, cgi, and a pointless story line that goes nowhere other than killing off a character that has no significance to the Star Wars storyline.
-0%"
"The action and FX are awesome, Jar Jar is annoying but not very hard to ignore. This ISNT a bad movie, it just has a few issues that other SW films didn't have"
Much better the people give it credit for. Padme's hair and outfits give this movie a star alone
Better than the Last Jedi
"I love this movie, I enjoyed it very much"
"The long gap between the original Star Wars trilogy and its prequels meant The Phantom Menace was destined to disappoint many, but that doesn't excuse its flat direction and bad dialogue. The irritating character of Jar Jar Binks is a near-fatal misstep, and none of the other characters are exciting enough to make up for it. Naturally the score and production design are great, and at least George Lucas opens up the mythology instead of retreading old ground. It also gets plus points for the podrace sequence and a three-way lightsaber duel featuring the movie's largely wasted main antagonist Darth Maul."
"I think this film gets to much hate, people make it seem like it is the worst film ever it is just because it did not live to up to super fans' impossible to beat standards. I do agree the film is not perfect it is not as bad as people say it is. It has in my opinion it has a good straight to point plot which is quite fast paced. I think the acting in this film is good to especially Liam Neeson. But I do have some complaints, three main ones the biggest one is Jar Jar he is annoying and SFX on him is also average. The other one is the SFX for action scenes the final battle scene is good for the action but the SFX is quite bad. The final one is the line ‘Now this is pod racing' is very cringey. I'm conclusion I think this is an average film I do think it is good but it does have some flaws overall you could watch it once but I do not think you could watch more than once."
"I found the film enjoyable as a kid however certain characters dimmed my enjoyment, however when considering the whole plot I feel that it was distinct from the originals while remaining clearly in universe and also setting up the new trilogy"
"not what the people expected back then (after the original trilogy) this movie starts a new trilogy and expends the universe in an incredible good way. The movie it self, quite good, definitely deserves a better score, I think many people just rated it bad because it wasn´t what they expected (the hype back then was much bigger compared to 7, and especial the hard core fansbase had somenting different in mind)"
"""The Phantom Menace"" is the movie that brought Star Wars back to the mainstream media. While it is not good in comparison to any of the original three films due to the film's bad acting and poor execution, it has some bright ideas and good action sequences good enough to keep you invested, 6/10."
It was honestly a good movie but needed a little hit of work on the cgi part and the acrobatics.
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was good. Definitely worth a watch.
"The best Lightsaber fight of all the Star Wars Movies, between Darth Maul and Obi Wan/ Qui-Gon. Shame about Jar Jar Binks"
"It has good universe building and action, with great music. However most other things are either boring or useless, jar jar makes me want to die, but Ewan McGregor is great overall about a 4.5 out of 10"
Even at the time the CGI was a joke and couldn't make up for the terrible B-story of Gungdan v Droids. The running time is too long and should focus more on Darth Maul v Jedi instead of all the uninteresting subplots.
Unwatchable and boring. How did CGI GET WORSE after all these years?
I hate these kinds of Star Wars movies.
Everything was great about this movie accept for bringing in Jar Jar Binks.
"To see my movie reviews channel, go to YouTube and type in Beanlight Reviews. The following is a transcript of my movie review.

So this is the week where if you watched one SW movie per week, it'll land you right on the week of the release of The Rise of Skywalker, which comes out December 20. I'm talking the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, the newest movies in the saga, and the two spinoff movies, Rogue One and Solo. 

Whew! That's a lot!

And while gearing up for the release of Episode 9, I'm going to watch the movies in an order I never thought I would, starting with Episode 1. Because I don't care what George Lucas says, you're supposed to start with Episode 4. But, my kids are away for a couple more weeks, and I'm going to show them episodes 4-6 for the first time in their lives when they get back, so I figured I'd get these prequel movies and spinoffs out of the way before they come home. 

Because they can watch the prequels on their own merits for all I care. But I'm gonna watch ‘em now so I can share my thoughts of them with you. 

So Episode I: The Phantom Menace.

I . . . Where do I begin? 

When I think of The Phantom Menace, two things immediately come to mind, and that's Jar Jar Binks, and Jake Lloyd, child actor. I don't want to say Jake Lloyd without qualifying it with ""Child Actor"" because he's grown man now, and could be a very good actor for all we know. Point is, we can't all be judged on our past. As for everyone involved in conceptualizing and voicing Jar Jar, I mean, that was more of a group effort, so we can attack the clan on that one. Or, maybe the clan's leader . . . 

And I've got to say up front. I just hate the name Jar Jar Binks. It seriously sounds like a ratty toy one of the Rugrats would have found in a puddle of mud and they decided to give it the name Jar Jar Binks. 

I hate that name. 

So this movie's weird to me. When I get the Star Wars itch, or there's a new Star Wars movie about to be released, by decree, I have to go back and rewatch all the movies. I have to. It's not an option. And that includes the sequels. And whenever I'm like, ""You know I'm feeling pretty optimistic, maybe the Phantom Menace won't be that bad,"" then I usually come out of the movie pretty disappointed because I was giving the movie a new hope. See what I did there? But if I go into the movie with the attitude of, ""Uuuugh, this is gonna suck worse than going to work at 4:00 AM on Monday morning in the dead of winter. Just kidding, nothing's that bad. Maybe. But then I watch the movie with that attitude, and I'm like, ""Okay, it's not that bad."" I can overlook its flaws, I can appreciate it for what it's trying to do, and I can see the little speckles of gems that are just trying so hard to shine through this rock pile of a movie. 

I'll say this, that one thing helps with watching this movie. Get it in blu ray. I don't know, but for some reason, having a crisper, cleaner version to look at goes a long way in eliminating some of the torture of watching this movie, and it really does help the special effects to stand out as they should. And even after twenty years, the effects do look pretty good even today. 

And I love the creature and droid designs in this movie. The big fish in that Gungan lake, totally unnecessary to the story, but I'm still glad they're there. Because on the outside, it's just an ordinary lake that you'd go splashing around in at summer camp. Might even put in a slide and the blob. But you never know what's lurking just below the surface . . .  Like, I love that shit. 

And say what you will about the advancement of technology in relation to the timeline of the two trilogies, but those droidekas are bad. Ass. I want more of those. I want those to replace bodyguards in real life. Hell, I want one of those to replace Kevin Kostner in THE Bodyguard, and we'd have a much better movie. 

And I actually really do love just about any scene with Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. They're seasoned actors who bring talent onscreen. I think their chemistry is a bit jilted by possibly the directing, and having to be conformed in what a boring-ass Jedi relationship would be, but still, they themselves and their story arc bring the most interesting scenes to the table here. 

Like, this is the movie where we get to see a day in the life of a Jedi, where they're protecting the queen, and I love that stuff. Like, that's what a jedi would be doing. 

And of course Darth Maul is great. We just don't get much of him, and that feels a little bit like a cheat. Is it a cheat, or is it now standard practice within the Star Wars universe? You know, show us this really badass villain, then kill him before they have their chance to shine. 

Instead, let's focus all our attention on someone who shouldn't shine. Someone who shouldn't even exist. And that's (say it with me children) Jar Jar Binks. I don't want to dwell too much on him, because then it's like we're giving the bad kid in class too much attention, which is exactly what he wants. But watching this movie, I realized, The Phantom Menace would actually be a decently good movie if they just took out Jar Jar. 

You hear that, George Lucas? How's about you release a special edition where you cut that gunga out of the movie instead of making Greedo shoot first? 

I'm just saying. 

Even if he didn't talk, it would improve the movie by so much in my book, because he says things that just don't matter, and he never ever shuts up, and I'm taken out of the movie and tempted to press mute, or skip to a scene without him in it. 

There's my piece on Jar Jar. I've said it. It's over, it's done. 

Now. 

Jake Lloyd. Let me first say that I don't blame anything on Jake Lloyd. 

It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Jake. It's not your fault. I mean, the kid was just doing what he was told. 

I blame his parents for taking him to the audition. I blame the casting department. And I blame George Lucas for not demanding more of him. I don't know, maybe he just didn't have it in him to push a kid that hard, and deep down, ol' George is just a soft little Eewok. 

It's just so disturbing to think that somewhere out there, a little boy, the perfect Anikin Skywalker is out there, never knowing fame, because the casting director didn't do their job right. You could even say, it's a disturbance in the force. A missed opportunity for the universe. 

If Jar Jar makes it feel like I'm watching a Saturday morning cartoon, then Jake Lloyd makes it feel like I'm watching a low budget amateur YouTube series. 

At one point, Qui Gon Jin is like, ""There's something about this boy."" There sure is, Qui Gon. There sure is. 

I remember thinking for years that the pod racing scene is like almost a half hour long, because it does tend to drag on forever. But this time watching it, I timed it, from the start of the race to the finish, and it clocks in at just ten minutes. Who'd have known? 

And as for all the taxation and senate stuff . . . I was surprised at how little screen time even that took up. It's just unnecessary technobabble that reassures the viewers that you're not watching a little kids' movie. Or is it? 

One thing I will say, is that George Lucas told the story he wanted to tell, and he did it boldly, with heels dug deep. It never feels like the actual story is waffling, not really knowing where it wants to go. It has a definite start, it knows its course, and it sticks to it until the designated finish. So well, done, Mr. Lucas. I commend you. 

Now whether we agree with the story that was told, that's a different subject altogether. Personally, I would have preferred to jump into this trilogy finding Anikin as a teenager, or even let this movie just be about Obiwan's training, and then we don't see Anikin until the end. I just don't think it's necessary to see Darth Vader as a little kid. I understand this is Lucas's way of getting us to sympathize with his eventual downfall, but there are much better ways to accomplish that. 

I honesty don't think this movie is necessary outside of, ""Oh, I get to watch an extra two and a half hours of Star Wars for my Star Wars marathon."" I wanted an Episode 1, but not this episode one. I will say, that if they had cut out Jar Jar or replaced Jake Lloyd – if they'd done just one of those things – this would have been a much, much better movie. But they wanted to have it both ways, and the movie, and the Star Wars saga, suffers for it. 

I'll be ranking the theatrical released Star Wars movies throughout this series, and since this is the first SW movie I've reviewed, it gets to hold the spot for number one on my list. But not for long . . . 

We'll see. Attack of the Clones might replace it next week. Or it might not. I can never remember which one is worse. Or better. 

It won't be until I get to Revenge of the Sith until the competition actually starts."
Thought it was great
"Its alright, great end battle but everything else feels stale and drawn out"
"At first I didn’t like this one, but then I watched it again leading up to episode 9 and it’s a lot better than I remembered. It’s fun and sometimes keeps a good emotional tone. Overall, it has absolutely nothing one 4,5, and 6 but it’s fine for what it is. Definitely doesn’t deserve all the hate."
"Oh where do I start with this movie? While there is a lot of take there is also some give in the movie. I would like to point out the bad first, then the good. Like I said, there's a lot of give and take. The direction that George Lucas gives the movie has a very slick style. Not a lot of grime and dirt that the original has. The look is just very polished. Speaking of the look I wanna talk about the special affects. Let me just say the obvious, they are everywhere. Even when there doesn't need to be. For example you could've had the pod racers practice when they're just sitting in the cockpit. But at the same time, the movie did evolve CGI. They developed the first CG character. Even though the comedy of the said character did fall in his face. There's also some bad puppetry like those racist politic aliens had. Also the villain, Darth Maul, doesn't really have a lot of character. He just looks cool and wants to reveal himself to the Jedi. Take that out of context from the movie or in, that doesn't make a difference. Now the good, I think Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi was a perfect choice. Also the action is a lot of fun from the beginning. But it can be very scarce with the political dialogue. Which I almost forgot to mention is that there isn't a lot of character driven dialogue. It's very expository. But there is one line which could be used for a lot of occasions, ""the ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent"". Another thing is that Ian McDermid is really captivating as the chancellor. Even though he doesn't have a lot of screen time. Lastly I want to talk about two scenes, those are the pod race scene is pretty engaging. But it uses the same shots, pan from left to right and POV shots. Also the final fight scene has too much going on. The fight between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Maul is really good and the choreography is excellent. Also you do feel what Obi Wan feels when Qui Gon dies. It's a really touching scene. Now on to the second thing which is the fight between the Gungans and the droids is fine popcorn fun, but has annoying slap stick. But the Doughnut station is so unnecessary. It's just filler for the sake of filler and they didn't know what to do with Annie during that battle. All in all the Phantom Menace, while it's fine for what it is, is disappointing. The only reason I would watch it is if I was marathoning the Star Wars Saga."
"Great movie, definitely had things about it I wasn't crazy about but so does every Star Wars movie. Loved the Darth Maul scenes, young Anakin was great, Jar Jar is fine, didn't like that C3PO was in it but whatever, I loved the Midichlorians! Liam Neeson did awesome, liked that character, didn't like that R2 was in, its implausible that these droids would be coincidentally through all of Star Wars. Overall good movie though."
"You know, my dad likes this movie because of the scenery and the graphics."
"This movie has definitely aged well, especially in light of what Disney has done with the sequel trilogy. Seeing such a bright, optimistic young boy who will one day become Vader... it's mesmerizing if you keep this in mind the whole time. I've even made room in my heart for ol' Jar Jar, who is a lighter story element meant to counterbalance the somewhat tedious plot. Ahmed Best really sells that performance. The Force is strong with this initial prequel entry."
love this movie and prequels so under rated great special effect revolutionary CGI for the time which still holds up very well great story great characters very good acting and leagues better than the Disney star wars so much to love so much to enjoy.
Too much walking and talking
Nowhere near as bad as the last couple of films. I actually liked this one. At least they were actually doing stunts. Jar jar was not annoying to me at all. I'd take him over the annoying cast we got today.
Nostalgic crap. Jar Jar was by far the best character.
Blame Jar Jar for why people hate this film
"There's a lot to hate, but there's also a lot to love"
this movie is not a very good Star Wars movie. But is still a good movie if you forget it is a Star Wars movie. it focus too much on politics. Which you don't want in a Star Wars movie but if you just focus on the battle's you will have a good time
"one of the best installments of the saga, with one of the most epic laser saber duels and one of the most credible sith, darth maul."
"I used to complain about the Star Wars prequels and I'll admit they still have their strong flaws. To name a couple flaws in this film Jar jar sucked and at times the acting was cringy. However compared to the sequels these are ""good"" Star Wars movies and I'd recommend watching them for the full Star Wars experience."
Some of the best visual effects and most unerable moments by jar-jar but least it's the a good Star Wars pre-queal.
"Truly rotten. Really, does anyone like this movie?"
Jar Jar is hilarious
"Although, it's a bit rough. It's a well needed story to explain the origin of our beloved characters, Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker. Definitely recommend this film."
Darth Maul is CRIMINALLY underused
When this first came out I was so excited to go and watch it but when I got half way through and Realised that I could've gone to sleep at home instead. It was really terrible and if you love Star Wars please stay from this episode. Furthermore it really is trash from the bottom of the bin. If you have a copy on dvd or vhs it would make an excellent frisbee and nothing more. If I find a copy in my collection I would burn it because it is a massive waste of time.
"Not the horrifying monster everyone remembers it to be. Mediocre , but that final duel . Come on."
Dry and very slow.   Graphics were very pastel coloured and almost blurry.  Way too much cgi throughout.
"Yes, it's Target audience is younger kids, but it is still good. Jar Jar is dumb, I'll admit (even though hes probably the real villain) and the CGI is awful, but the story is good, and JAKE LLOYD IS FINE. HE WAS BEING A NINE YEAR OLD. The Darth Maul lightsaber duel is one of the best in the franchise."
"While it is not the strongest film in the Star Wars saga, it doesn't deserve all the negative criticism it gets. Overall it felt ahead of its time in regards of both the political plot element and what it wanted cgi to do. The cgi heavy elements of the film don't really look good from how far the rest of the prequel trilogy goes. There needed to be more politics for the sub plot to really work but I think that this is in part due to not believing the average movie goer would want political intrigue. Seeing how good things like game of thrones or house of cards have portrayed politics I would love to have seen more on the senate. Jar Jar Binks is terrible in every way imaginable but there are some great performances from McGregor, Portman and Neeson. The pod race scene and the duel of fates are iconic."
"Underrated, has some great moments"
"Jar Jar Binks is an abomination and makes this film literally unwatchable. However, the Jedi scenes are mostly entertaining."
"Driving too deeply into messy space politics and not spending too much time on the main conflict of its central characters sinks this prequel movie, but it still stands up as one with a great cast, one of the best scores in filmmaking history, as well as one of the best Star Wars villains of all time in Darth Maul, a feat despite his rather limited screentime."
"As a child when I saw this in the theatres, after all the hype leading upto it, I loved it! Now re watching 20 years later, I still enjoyed it, but did see a little bit of what the critics said about it, in particular Jar Jar binks. Still though, some of the action scenes and in particular the introduction of the character ""Darth Maul"" were unforgettable and timeless."
"One of the best stories, one of the worst movies."
Darth Maul practically saves this film.
"Great story good paced movie about state in decline. Jedi order after thousand years become servants to the republic instead of the Force making them lost force sight. Qui Gon was only exception. Epic movie. Too much silly stuff make some part bad, but overall this movie deserve atleast 70%"
Darth Maul was cool..
"The ultimate set up film for George Lucas' classic saga of a boy, a girl, and a galaxy as the original trailer stated. Fans and critics pan it yet they forget the premise of the film is to set up all the others. Which is does quite well also complaining about politics and a child friendly character are poor excuses. The story is cohesive the characterization is presented interestingly. Liam Neeson proves why he's such a great leading man. Must see."
Darth Maul was the big selling point in this film. Could have done without the midichlorians-it de-mystified some of the force.
The darth maul fight saved this movie for me
Jar Jar and baby Vader are the worst
Jar jar is a sith lord
"Burdened by exposition and awkward writing and acting, The Phantom Menace is a disappointment — albeit visually interesting — compared to its beloved predecessors"
"The battle with Qui Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul is such an amazing lightsaber fight."
decent movie but the worst of the 8 films for sure
I dislike the hate this film received because it had some fantastic actors. The soundtrack was phenomenal and beautiful.
Best episode of the movie
"Of course characters would act without much emotion since Jedi are paragon type characters and Padme when was Queen she had to remain serious. When Padme play just Padme, she was fine and kid Anakin was never boring. Qui Gon and Obi Wan are never boring just they cannon jump and yell because that is not how Jedi act. Even Luke in ep6 was seroius. Plot was fine and wasn't about trade, but how republic cannot function because of corruption"
"Burdened by exposition and populated with stock characters, The Phantom Menace gets the Star Wars prequels off to a bumpy -- albeit visually dazzling -- start."
I do not understand this movie. I just like to imagine Lucas telling all the actors to act with no emotion.
"First time, I saw it, I was disapointed, but it began to build the Saga."
This is a stale boring excuse for a star wars movie with comedy that falls flat and every second scrapes by. The only two parts that are actually good is the end fight and the pod race. But I appreciate the jumps it did for technology
"CGI still looks great and will continue to look great. Actors were awesome. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ian Mcdiarmid and great story that continue in ep2 and 3. The Phantom Menace serve as excellent fundation for rest of saga. And nothing on this world is more epic that duel of the Fates and soundtrack that go with it."
"As juvenile and off-putting as a wet nappy. Terrible writing, terrible acting and cgi that has aged as well as the career of its star actor. Irredeemable garbage and an insult to fans of Star Wars. In the age of remakes and reboots, how about a remake of this steaming pile?"
"Meh, not that bad. I think it's better than Attack of the Clones but not as good as Revenge of the Sith."
"Great introduction in to galaxy that is in peace, but started to falling apart. Lucas genius way of telling real world history in fantasy movie because many conflicts started because trade in history. Naboo and Tatooine was great addition to Star Wars galaxy. This movie should have atleast 80% positives reviews."
"Right away, my least favourite of the 8 Skywalker saga movies (I find it hard to rank Rouge One, and I haven't seen Solo.) Most of the movie is just boring nonsense on Tatoonie and Naboo, and don't get me started on the Trade Federation. RUBBISH! Its few redeeming features are 1) Darth Maul, steals every one of the several scenes he is in, just an amazing villian, up there with Darth Vader and Palpatine, 2) That final battle with Maul, thrilling, 3) Yoda's cameo appearance and 4) John William's score. Overall pretty average entertainment for the family."
"Every Saga have its Beginning.
EPIC!!! I cannot give enough praises to entire PT. Revolution in entire movie industry. Definitely better than OT and only LOTR is better but not by much."
"Avesome start to awesome adventure.
Along with soundtrack and duel of the fates, i really liked when Padme said that will not play games while her peoples suffer and that she will return ultimately creating plan and defeating Trade Federation in city."
"Lucas always wanted to tell story and he did it. Great movie. Few nitpicks about too much Jar Jar or that kid Anakin shouldn't be one in fighter. 
Duel of the Fates
Duel with Maul
Podracers
New Galaxy in time of peace in state of falling apart
Jedi at their full strenght( not old guys from obsolete trilogy)
Sith behind scene and Palpatine rise to power. One of best movies ever"
The Phantom Menace is the weakest of the Franchise. It's made for money's sake.
"An exciting and entertaining, if a bit underwhelming beginning to the prequels, combined with Lucas's direction and script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Tattersall's cinematography, Burtt and Smith's editing, Bocquet's production design, Walpole's set decoration, Biggar's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, The Phantom Menace is an exciting and adventurous blockbuster!!!"
"An absolute trainwreck. Avoid at all costs. Duel of the Fates and its accompanying lightsaber fight are the only draws. However, I am thankful that this film exists, for we would not have the Mr Plinkett review without it. 2/10"
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a good movie... except for the last part of the movie. I'll explain later. Now Darth Maul is a good villain. However Nute Gunray and Lott Dodd are horrible all they do is talk about the princess signing a freaking decoy but they send their army to do it for them but they don't do anything. Character I hate are Anakin and Padmé. The performance didn't seem good by Jake Lloyd and Padmé is just some random girl that comes out of nowhere and is now the star of the movie. Things I don't like about this movie is they don't introduce the characters well we are just thrown in seeing them with their lightsabers. Another thing I didn't like was why kill Qui-Gon Jinn he was a good character and an amazing performance by Liam Nesson. The last part of this movie just goes down the toilet the freaking aliens are fighting to sign a decoy and the battle is totally stupid you got a kid just in a coincidence destroy the ship. To sum this movie up it is a okay movie not the best but not that bad either I give it a 4 out of 5
It has some good scenes and some boring scenes but in the end it is a good star to the prequel saga
"One of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen. I remember being so excited for this. Looking back, it does some stuff better than I recalled like CGI, the score, and the action scenes. But it gets bogged down by bad acting, weak pacing, and a muddled plot"
"I enjoy The Phantom Menace quite a bit more than most people, but it has a ton of flaws. I hate Jar Jar Banks as much as everyone else does, and I believe he is one of the worst Star Wars characters. Jake Lloyd is awful as 9-year-old Anakin, and the plot of the film is too political and very confusing. That being said, I love Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn as well as Ewan McGregor  as a young, youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi. Also, the lightsaber duel with Darth Maul is awesome! B- 65/100"
"Not easy to resume the Star Wars universe; indeed, this movie failed."
Jar Jar Binks couldn't be more annoying if he tried.
"This movie has always been great, granted some Jar Jar scenes weren't that good but everything was amazing, so many iconic memes, duels, and CGI"
There's always a bigger fish
One of my favorite movies.
"Visually astonishing, an exciting spacial adventure."
"Looking back, this movie isn't all that bad. Saw it when I was 9, and watched it recently. Not great, not terrible."
It's just an average movie. The prequels are known to be weak and they are.
"This episode is clearly under the precedents but delivers a good first look on the old times that Ben Kenobi told to Luke in SW4. Offering a good sense of nostalgia. The biggest problem of this movie is probably the retcon on the force thing and the acting of a lot of characters. However, it's a decent Star Wars who has a heart and has a decent story to tell."
"The movie was an average to below average movie with a very good storyline but little character development. It was unclear who the main character was. It was obvious that Obi Wan should have been the main character But they put more focus on an unnecessary gungan. The dialogue is just plain dumb. Though there where some interesting things such as Darth Maul and the Sith coming out of hiding there where just too many flaws. What boosts this movies rating is the ending fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi Wan, and Qui Gon. The scene was nothing short of great and it was filled with suspense. I did enjoy this movie but it wasn't up to par with a Star Wars movie despite having loads of potential to be good. In my opinion this is definitely in the bottom half of Star Wars movies."
"The fact that people have said this film is better than what Disney is putting out is something else. Lucas decided to throw out Story for a world building film, which isn't so bad, but in a franchise that prides itself on story, that's a disappointment to me. McGregor does give a stellar performance as Obi-Wan (and I might actually like him more than Alec Guinness) Nesson and Park also give some solid performances, but Lucas's direction feels so odd that sometimes they get lost in the ground. Anakin is a little twerp (which personally is not what I want to see from the future Dark Lord of the Sith) and don't even get me started on Jar Jar Binks. The film isn't all bad, in fact for some it may be a guilty pleasure, the beginning and end are also quite fun to watch (when you're not cringing) but the middle drags on, and feels super boring. The film isn't terrible, but to call it good I'm not sure."
The Young Indiana Jones tv series should have been the warning where this Star Wars film was going to go. Ewan McGregor as always a bad casting decision.
"Pure garbage. Boring, tedious, dull, just painful to watch. The new ones are better by light years. Thank God Disney acquired LucasFilm."
This movie is not as bad as some perceive
"The Phantom Menace may be considered the worst of them all when it comes to the SW saga however I disagree, this movie does have it's flaws but it does have enjoyable qualities to it."
"A great prequel to the whole star wars saga. It sets up many great elements of the lore, expand the universe we know and love, in addition of showing the Jedis and the Republic right before the fall. Aside from a few dumb but forgivable moments (Anakin blowing up the mothership and the path through the core of Naboo, for example), I fell in love with this movie. Some may think the pace is a little too slow as there is a fair share of politics on screen, but it helped me understand the universe better and I love the characters in it. The fight at the end on the sound of Duel of the Fates will probably remain in my memory as the greatest fight in Star Wars in terms of tension and choregraphy."
"It is actually my favorite Star Wars movie, and thus makes it my favorite movie of all time. It is not a bad movie. Jar Jar isn't a horrible character, and there is an awesome lightsaber duel."
Thank God that Star Wars ep1-3 don't rehash OT obsolete stuff. This is better movie than any of OT. This movie was needed far more than OT because its actually built universe not leaving everything in dark like OT
Fans sensed a great disturbance in the force...
I really like this movie. the best parts are the music and the lightsaber fights
Great start of awesome story. Beginning of Palpatine rise to power that will end with republic turn in empire from inside. Epic duel and soundtrack plus many new cultures and wider universe. Tatooine was excellent and thank Lucas for story he always wanted to tell
"A visual masterpiece with a political story and some stunning action. Some bad acting, plot that is unspecific to the franchise, predictability and pacing issues will deter from the full enjoyment though"
"While I can't help but notice the amount of cracks The Phantom Menace has, such as the clunky dialogue, wooden acting, and CGI that didn't age well at all, I always turn into that six year-old kid immune to such flaws every time I watch it — even now as a grown adult."
"The return to the galaxy far far away is welcome, but the cringeworthy comic relief ruins what could have been another great Star Wars film."
I don't see why people don't like this movie because I think it's almost as good as the originals.
A big down as far as the series goes
Legendary movie! And thankfully disney cannot ruined it.
"It hurts me emotionally to watch this movie. I am scarred for life at how bad it is. Please, please, Disney, please remake this movie - actually, remake all 3 of the prequels, and turn them into something other than a steaming pile of Bantha Poo-doo. I'm begging you."
"Seeing a lot of adults giving their opinion on this movie based on how they *think* it would have been received by kids. This movie was released just before I was born and I watched it when I was a child and I loved it. I do have the common sense to admit that it is stodgy in parts and sometimes makes little sense, but the same can be said for all Star Wars movies. This one is not significantly worse than any of the others and deserves a better rating."
Epic movie with epic soundtrack.
Best paced of all SW movieswith awesome ending
The Phantom Menace has it's flaws but inspite of them I enjoy watching it
From epic Duel of the Fates fight and score to incredible worldbuilding and cracks of republic from inside thatnks to Sith.
One of the most entertaining Star Wars films ever made. This film creates a much larger and complex galaxy that the originals did not accomplish. It adds elements of a real culture between the podracing and trade negotiations. It also creates some exciting action with the lightsaber duels and droid battles.
"Don't get me wrong, this movie had some flaws, but it was a good movie. Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson's performances were pretty good and some of the CGI was some what decent in some parts (Pod racing scene), but there was some things that didn't make people happy. The CGI for Jar Jar Binks was really bad, didn't even make it look like he was really standing there, just copied and pasted him right in. And the little boy that played Anakin was not to par with me, he seems like a ""robot"" to me."
Episodes 1-3 should be remade.
"I think the biggest criticism of the prequel trilogy is that it was not like the older movies and was too childish and goofy. What these older fans also don't realize, is that this prequel trilogy was meant for kids. Growing up with this as a childhood favorite, I can speak that all kids I knew at the time enjoyed this movie. I believe it will be looked at better overtime as the younger generation gets older and more and more kids get to experience it the right way-from a child's point of view."
"Young children will probably enjoy The Phantom Menace, but ultimately, when you compare it to the original trilogy, everything about TPM is awful. New canon is terrible, old canon is trampled upon, and let's be honest, no one wants to watch a space opera film just to be mired down with politics involving an incompetent bureaucracy."
Much hate has been given to the Star Wars prequels but The Phantom Menace did give us a proper beginning for the greatest villain in film history...Darth Vader. Jake Lloyd plays Anakin Skywalker with a slyness which predicts his downfall and corruption leading to the darkside. Fanboys may not get it...try reading Joseph Campbell.
A spectacular beginning to the saga!
Star wars is sciece-fiction movie. Star Wars is set on a galaxi. This movie is a fight betwem rebels and empire.
"Not sure why people rag on this movie so much, yes it had its flaws but it was still a movie with a lot of neat concepts going on. Way better than the junk Disney gives us.

1) Actual Aliens
2) Podracing
3) Duel between Darth Maul
4) Naboo and Otah Gunga
5) Battle Droids and Destroyer Droids
6) Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman

Just a few things which were amazing with the film, not sure why theres so much hate plus George Lucas directed it. As far as Im concerned this is absolute gold and always will be compared to the terrible crap that we have to watch right now like the Last Jedi."
People are overreacting when jar jar comes up
"Story about how Rebuplic has fallen into corruption and cannot solve problems because of said corruption to Jedi Order that was offended by possibilty of Sith return.
Qui Gon as paragon type character and his student who are is conflict because of Jedi order. Palpatine masterfully create crisis with his pawns Trade Federation and he manage to be elected to be chancellor which was first step of his plan. Soundtrack is among best ever and lightsaber duel was best and only ep3 tops it.
Finally we  saw universe where technology is not like that bucket millenium falcon. Its good to see new vehicles and new species and new technology."
The movie has a great cast and great charcters with the exception of some and is a prequel to what is quite possibly the greatest saga of all time and completely ruins it by giving us great actors such as Liam neeson and Ewan McGregor and somehow making them deliver terrible performances and giving us dialogue sounding like it was written by a toddler and a boring movie in conclusion 4/10
It the Good Star Wars franchise ever... I felt like a kid when this movie came out in theater.
All good except the pod racing scene.
Great film with a lot of fun and interesting world building on how things use to be before the empire.
"An underrated film by all. Amazing cast and interesting plot. as a film that wasn't Star Wars this would be great but as a Star Wars film it lacks the ""Star Wars Magic"""
terrible - just terrible
"Look, this isn't the worst movie ever. I wouldn't even say it's... terrible. But this is still a really bad movie. The crappy effects, the dull writing and direction, and the ungodly pace are the main things that make me want to sink The Phantom Menace deep into the Naboo Abyss."
"This is now the 10th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and sadly I can't even say that it's a third as good as Episode IV: A New Hope.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is the 4th Star Wars film and the 1st Star Wars prequel. The film was directed by George Lucas who also directed Episode IV: A New Hope. The film stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn.

The acting was just plain bad from the emotion to the dialogue delivery. Now A New Hope may not have the best acting ever, but at least it was confident. The only person in my opinion that did a good job was Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. 

The characters are bad for the most part especially the Devil himself Jar Jar Binks, but I do have to say that a couple characters like Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn I did enjoy to watch on the big screen.

The cinematography was steady with a couple cool shots of the characters and scenery, but nothing that special.

The settings were mixed for me because I did like a couple of the destinations, but I have to say that most of the planets were either rehashes from the original trilogy or just very bland.

The set designs and props were strong, but sadly the film tries to use special effects over the practical effects.

The film in my opinion also has some good costume design especially with the Jedi and Sith.

The special effects in my opinion are very dated and really distract from the film. Personally I think that George Lucas should have stuck with the puppets.

The action wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. The Lightsaber fights were entertaining, but whenever it would involve the droids or ships it would just drag on.

The music was definitely the best thing within the film especially the song Duel of the Fates. Personally I think that John Williams is one of the greatest conductors of all time.

The story in my opinion felt off throughout the runtime of the film, but I want to say that I'm not against the idea of making a prequel to Star Wars if done properly.

The comedy was one of the most annoying things within the film especially with the character Jar Jar Binks. Every time Jar Jar Binks did something ï¿ 1/2~comical' I just wanted to turn off the TV and go outside.

The film also had some very interesting  ideas, but sadly they were executed wrongly.

The film is also quiet boring and hard to get through. Plus In my opinion I felt that it wasn't even a Star Wars film until the very end.

Over all I give it a 
3/10
32%
1.6/5

Darth Maul was cool, but not enough to change my mind on the film."
"Ugh this movie has a few great ideas but many, many awful ideas that drag it down sooooo much. Great ideas are Darth Maul and Qui Gon Jinn. Qui Gon is a very interesting character and was incredibly likable and has always been one of my favorite characters in the saga. Darth Maul is maybe the coolest villain in film history, the design, the weapon, everything about him is just great. However, Darth Maul gets only one good scene in the whole movie and is very underutilized. Now the bad ideas include using CGI on NEARLY EVERY SHOT in the movie, there is literally only ONE shot in the whole movie without CGI. The pod racing concept sounds kinda cool but it's somehow extremely boring. Another terrible idea is the Gungans, I don't need to elaborate on that I think everyone knows why the Gungans are awful. Overall this movie isn't very important to the franchise and isn't really worth your time."
"Not all too bad, it's kind of good! The only part of the movie that Kim dog ruined it was the long and extended pod race. However, great start to the franchise!"
"John Williams' score carries this film on its back. The writing and directing are just not there for most of the film. The way characters speak is boring, the only exceptions are Liam Nesson and Ewan Mcgregor's performances. Its ending sequence is the best part of the film by far but it's mostly due to score and choreography."
"Episode I is a mildly enjoyable movie held back by dated effects and less than stellar writing, problems that would plague the other two movies in the underwhelming prequel trilogy. All in all, TPM is a decent movie that in hindsight is rather inconsequential to the rest of the saga."
Awesome and absolute star wars
"Underrated for It's brilliant plot, adventure, and cinematography. Obi wan was pretty much the only character who developed, but that does not make any of the other ones any less interesting. Felt the most like the original trilogy out of any other Post 80s star wars movie, to this day."
I think the prequels are great.
"What we really lack here in Episode 1 are interesting and relatable characters. Here we have NO Han, No Leia and No Luke. 
We do have Darth Maul, arguably this trilogies version of Darth Vader. Maul is younger and far more physical, giving us arguably one of the best lightsaber battles of the saga (its at least in top3).
Phantom Menace is often said to be boring and lacking a good plot. 
My feeling is that Episode 1 is setting the overall story of the saga in motion. The important plot point in the movie is basically Sidious using the Trade Federation to cause a crisis and in the process creating a situation that causes the Republic to lose faith in Valorum, the current Chancellor, to set in motion his master plan to become Chancellorn of which works beautifully. Thats the plot that matters most, and not particularly violent enough for some fans it seems.
 
Phantom Menace is actually pretty fun at times and it rarely drags too much, although I admit it does occasionally.
Phantom Menace is  very much a visual film which doesn't really let the audience get to know very much about any one  character.
Anakin here is a young ten year old boy. This is fine but also means the part has to be recast for the next movie, meaning the audience dont connect with the performer in the way they would with Luke/Hamill over three movies. The fun in a film franchise is also in seeing the actors change and and evolve with their characters. 

This film is an OK film. It will only appeal to Star Wars fans first and foremost, in most cases. This film will Im sure develop a sort of cult status in years to come as its totally unfairly maligned."
in hindsight it is pretty fun to watch as a kid. as an adult it is okayish.
"Huge disappointment, with a laughably bad plot, dialogue, characters"
Even better than episode 2. This is all you would expect from the origins of the galactic war. Entertaining but hard to ignore the terrible humor. Thats what gives this review the score it has.
Duel of the Fates. Do I have to say more?
dont understand the hate i can watch this over and over
Very creative film. I love it
"Not bad.  A fun day at the theater with the family, or in front of the television.  Terrible acting by the kid."
"The great failure of this movie is its obsession with gimmicks, quirks, and spectacle while failing to tell a engaging story or deliver interesting characters. The only good things about this movie are Natalie Portman's acting and the creative inventiveness of the vehicles, costuming, and locations. However, it also fails to deliver a lasting visual palate - a trademark of the original trilogy. It's possibly the single greatest example of the failures of corporate filmmaking in the early digital era."
"It had some pacing issues and oddities, but the new Jedi, the start of the Anakin saga, the pod-racing and the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi made it an exciting movie to see."
i seen better but the new this is a master piece
This movie is the definition of a massive disappointment. It's hard to believe that we went from fantastic movies like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back to a terrible movie like this. What happened? Almost nothing works about this movie. Grade: D
then ending light sabre battles makes up for the rest of the movie
"Against popular opinion, The Phantom Menace is my favorite prequel film. Despite Jar Jar and young Anakin, it is less cartoony and more reminiscent of the original trilogy. It has one of the best lightsaber battles against a great villain. Some fan-edits help smooth its rough edges."
Sceneggiatura banale. Recitazione appena passabile. Scenografia e regia discrete. Il tutto condito da una colonna sonora di J. Williams ottima. Voto: 7 (meritato in maggioranza dalla colonna sonora)
This Movie is Amazing
"Rewatched it a couple of nights ago and itï¿ 1/2(TM)s still as dull and as boring as it was the first time I watched it. Liked the last 20 minutes or so, though...."
"I was 14 when I first saw this movie in the cinema, I Loved it then and i still do now!"
"La amenaza fantasma es una historia que dista mucho de la trilogÃ­a original de Star War por allÃ­ en los 80's. Sin embargo, tiene la esencia pura de la saga pero a la vez fresca por que nos trae aventuras nuevas asÃ­ formando en si su propia identidad. 
Erra mucho en sobrecargar el filme de personajes secundarios que distraen y te hacen seguir el hilo de la historia pero llegan a ser tediosos y olvidables en muchos casos. 
Se rescata el gran cast principal de la pelÃ­cula contando con grandes personajes como Kenobi, Anakin, Padme y Qui Gon. 
No abusa del fan service, de hecho, sabe muy bien como usarlo dentro de la historia para que no se sienta forzado. 

Al final... es una historia reconfortante, aventurera, nostÃ¡lgica y que por momentos puede pegar lo tedioso para mal. Bastante aceptable."
This was the worst Star Wars movie until Episode 7 and 8 came out. Child Anakin Skywalker is very annoying. I actually found Jarjar Binks endearing rather than annoying unlike most people.
Great music! That is the only major thing this turd gets right...
"If you just take out Jar Jar Binks, then the film is gold. This film's only problem is Jar Jar. While the kids will find him funny (I did when I was a kid, and stil do) he is a bit extra. Take him out and you've got a story about a wise Jedi Maverick who frees a child slave so he can live out his dream of being a Jedi, as well as Qui-Gon's belief that he is the Chosen One. Then, just sprinkle in a bit of beef with the Jedi Council, and the return of the Sith, and you got yourself gold."
I really enjoyed it.
ideas good but done very poor
"With the exception of JarJar Binks, the movie was very entertaining."
"The Phantom Menace did at least have some entertainment value. It still had a script that was quite scatterbrained and an alternate atmosphere that divided not just the look and feel of Star Wars, but also the fans."
"Me encanto el universo de George Lucas, muestra algo que nunca habiamos visto."
A bit campy but my god it's a star wars movie and looking back we were too hard it it. It's a fun romp and highlights the transformation Anakin went through to become Dark Vader.
"Loved this movie, yes yes including the midichlorians :)"
Is this movie the best Star Wars movie? NO! Is it bad? this was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw and was the movie that made me a fan in the first place. Now looking back I can see the problems some people but overall the good overshadows the bad. While the CG looks dated the worlds and aliens are very imaginative and interesting. And the world building is pretty solid. Overall while this movie is not my favorite SW movie it still holds a special place in my heart.
"I was going to give this one half a star, but The Last Jedi made this one look like Citizen Kane, so I had to bump it up to a full star.  Don't get me wrong; the movie is still a steaming pile of bantha poodoo.  And to all those ignorant little kids who thought Darth Maul was just soooooo great!.... the guy didn't last one full movie, kids.  He was a Sith lord wannabe.  Vader got six films and deserves your respect and admiration.  Maul just deserves to be swept into a bottomless pit and forgotten.  Hell, even George thought so since he did it himself in the film =)"
Better that all new saga
The Star Wars prequel trilogy starts off with a rotten entry.
Best movie ever compared to TLJ.
"Only better than Attack of the Clones, Phantom Menace sees George Lucas struggles to deliver an entertaining ride, boring the audience with politics and offensive stereotypes when it should be giving fans more moments like the Darth Maul duel and Pod Race."
I love this movie. It is one of my favorites.
Best lightsaber fight around
"A film I watched repeatedly, and my favorite film of all time until I watched Kick-Ass.  Perfect casting, characters, performances, special effects, score, and pacing; a nearly flawless film, and very enjoyable to watch."
First act boring. Full of characters from original trilogy.
"I actually liked this one, I think Jake was railroaded on this as his acting wasn't as bad as people make out there is also a directorial issue here as well, I believe this is the first Star Wars movie I can remember seeing, I believe I may have watched the Original three with my dad but can't remember it."
"One of the better Star Wars movies. Not only did it provide memes, but it started one of the best character arc with Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi."
"What a movie show. Props to Liam Neeson - sad he had to go! Darth Maul, half the man he used to be! (Spoilers)"
Compared to episodes 7 and 8 this movie is a masterpiece.
This movie is an instant classic and people will continue to rewatch this movie until the end of time.
This is getting out of control.
"Highly underated refelction of the failings of democracy in the mid 20th century. An intense thriller with morally complex heroes, an altruistic cult influencing the political theatre, and an iconic shadowy assassin."
It's george lucas' star wars. What more to say.
This is my favorite Star Wars of all time
Isn't so bad now when you compare it to the last jedi.
"Yes the scenes with young Anakin are boring, yes Jar Jar Binks is in this movie, but it still feels like a Star Wars movie, with the amazing lightsaber fight, and the Naboo airships flying into the trade federations ship. That just puts a good feeling in my heart"
Star Wars still has imagination to spare.
2nd best Star Wars movie to date
If your willing to look past jar jar blinks this movie is a great one. Could have been better though
The entry of a new generation with explosive action great actors for most and one of the best Liam Nesson Movie
"It had tension, wonderful art designs, a story of survival and deception, and Darth maul!! ...but jar Jar binks was a poor addition to garner comedy"
"Lame and even annoying characters, bland and forgettable dialogue, and unnecessary plot points all add up to make this an iconic bad film. Half of me loves this film and thinks it's an essential film to see just to learn how bad a film can be when a director has complete control of his project. Still yes, a bad film that is well deserved of its reputation."
Not terrible like Attack of the Clones but still bad.
"Not really any need for this movie.  This should be regarded as a historical appendix, more of a visual encyclopaedia entry than a movie in its own right.  Technically acceptable and doesn't break lore/canon, otherwise it would receive a lower score than 2.5"
"Stars wars : Episode 1 the Phantom menace , kicks off the Stars wars prequel trilogy with a somewhat slow start but an amazing tale to behold and some background to how it all began"
"Fantastic movie, only the empire would want to see it fail. I think itï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s aged very well. At first Iï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)m sure all the nostalgic movie goers were upset about the premise at first but now this movie is a very important corner stone for the whole franchise."
"One word: Qui-Gon. One of the best characters in the whole saga. Peaceful and wise. That by itself is enough.

The movie also expands the universe and understanding in the right direction. Great work!"
"quite a goofy movie looking back, but still entertaining
acting could have been better
graphics dont hold up very well
sound effects were great"
"One name, Jar Jar Binks. Ouch. To large of a part for way to much of the film."
great movie underrated
"So boring, I fell asleep talking about."
"Now, I'm not saying this is the worst Star Wars movie, but it is better than The Last Jedi. Sorry Rian, but it's true and the fans know it. I'd rather listen to Jar Jar talk than listen to the ""jokes"" we had to put up with in TLJ. Anyway, the movie was good, but not good enough to restart the Star Wars franchise."
"I liked this one, I know everyone hates it but whatever I grew up watching this"
I kinda like it. It is cheesy but it has very cool fight and moments. It may disappoint at certain points but the galaxy has ever seen bigger before.
Fun movie with some pacing issues. JarJar is far less annoying than I remembered him to be and all the other characters making fun of him is actually funny.
"If it were not for Duel of the Fates playing while the most iconic lightsaber duel took place, this movie would be significantly worse. This film laid groundwork for the subsequent Prequels, exploring the Republic in familiar locations. This movie misses the mark at points, but makes up for it in creating one of the greatest Star Wars moments."
"Mesmo sendo um dos filmes que mais assisti em toda minha vida, considero-o um filme fraco, o pior das duas trilogias. As cenas envolvendo polÃ­tica e seus diÃ¡logos sobre este mesmo tema chegam a ser massantes, desviando-se da trilogia original, muito mais focada nos conflitos (aÃ§Ã£o) e, atÃ (C) certo ponto, nas relaÃ§Ãµes entre os personagens. Entretanto, Ã (C) impossÃ­vel nÃ£o considerar o filme um mal necessÃ¡rio, jÃ¡ que ele consegue demonstrar os conflitos polÃ­tico-sociais que envolvia a galÃ¡xia. Por fim, as excelentes cenas de aÃ§Ã£o, como as Corridas de Pods e a batalha entre Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn e Obi-Wan Kenobi, fazem o esforÃ§o valer a pena."
"Really love this movie, and yea it could have done without certain things like Jar Jar, but ever since he was introduced itâ(TM)s like a meme I wouldnâ(TM)t want to live without. So in a way Iâ(TM)m glad Jar Jar was there. Loved Qui Gon and Obi Wan, loves Darth Maul, and it was a great way to portray things prior to the empire and how a small dispute was the beginning of a larger means for Palpatine to rise to power.  A lot of thought went into this movie and really sets up a story for the next films that has a solid story arc.  So aside from some of the things that werenâ(TM)t delivered great, it was a great movie that is important to the rest of the saga."
"Stilted characters, boring trade disputes, and character as bland as burnt toast. The Phantom Menace is the beginning of the long and arduous downfall for the Star Wars series. With an overbloated budget and a momentous cast and crew of talent Lucas and Co. create one of the most disapointing returns for a franchise in movie history. Besides the spectacular podrace scene and gorgeous backdrops, Episode 1 misses the mark on everything else."
"A great movie, Darth Maul is one of the best characters to come around in a long time. Does not get enough credit for what this movie did for a new generation of fans. This is to them what A New Hope was to the older generation"
"A fun flick that has always warmed my heart. I love it, but maybe that is just because of how much of a fan I am for the franchise?"
Would watch this over the Last Jedi any day. Masterpiece compared to Rian's garbage story.
"I don't understand why this movie has such bad reviews. I like EPISODE I just because of the fact that it's different. George Lucus offres a whole new view of the STAR WARS universe with a new hero, a new story and dazzling visual effects!
A lot of fans argue that the dialogue is terrible and that the acting is bad, and I agree. But  at the same time, I would like to point out that STAR WARS was never well-known for its outstanding acting or its sophisticated dialogue. The story and the effects are the important  factors, and THE PHANTOM MENACE delivers. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are on top form. Darth Maul is just so fricking awesome. Not disappointed at all."
"This was actually the last Star Wars movie I paid to see on the big screen, which makes me a Star Wars hipster who gave up on SW before it was cool to do so - Suck it TLJ anti-fans! :-P

The writing was bad. I actually had a moment of huge personal inspiration 10 minutes into the movie when I released if dialogue like this could be made into a movie I still had a chance to have my own personal writing career.

The Pod Race was fun. The end was 'let's attack the giant space station thing' cause the viewers seemed to like it in 2 of the other 3 movies and my investment in the characters became so low that I was starting to pick up where the animation loops were in the CGI crowd scenes because my mind had nothing else to do.

I don't hate it, just think it is a very very average movie I had no real interest in ever watching again."
Gets better on subsequent viewings if taken as part of the whole series and if one either ignores a certain character or entertains a popular internet theory that has this character as the mastermind villain behind it all. Main problem with the movie was an attempt to create a character for comic relief would have been better served by placing a more serious character to occupy that place in the plot.
"Jar Jar Binks is Basically Donkey from Shrek but less Annoying, also Boring Plot, Borin Visual Effects, and not so Good Scenes, No wonder it was Nominated for the Oscars."
Not the worse in the franchise as that is the last jedi but it is boring along with some good action and at the time the best lightsaber duel until ep 3
"To be honest people are being to harsh on this film . True it is a bit childish at places but it's a good movie at least in my opinion. It has a certain heart and wonderment to it that even though it takes a few missteps to put it nicely, it manages to be an interesting addition to the Star Wars franchise  . I would give this a 5 star if it wasn't for the obvious elephant in the room (jar jar of course) which stains the movie , but at least it doesn't stain the whole franchise like the sequel trilogy did ."
"hate the kid Anakin and Jar jar, love the final jedi battle and it's soundtrack. In fact best soundtrack ever in my opinion."
"This is truly my favorite movie of all time the lore and captivating characters of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul.and Padma and Anakin Skywalker this is a treasure for generations to come."
Big Man says this is the best movie ever! 5/5
"Even if this movie is considered bad and it had many flaws, it's still a gem compared to the Disney trash, namely TLJ. The lightsaber duels are amazingly choreographed and the movie respects the general in-universe lore (unlike the sequel trilogy) and does not feel like a blatant cashgrab. Also the meme factor and the fact that this movie has the cheesy feeling to it makes it worth a watch in my eyes. 

#boostThePrequelRatings"
"Exciting beginning of the Star Wars Saga and the tale of Anakin Skywalker. The film itself is a reflection of Episode IV A New Hope, and uses it beautifully. Exciting and beautiful battles, thoughtfully crafted story, and an amazing cast.  A true joy to watch!"
"An enjoyable flick, even with it's many flaws; Despite this it's better than the Sequel trilogy!"
I donï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t think this movie is as bad as people make it out to be. I like  jar Jar Binks  I know I said it.I like Darth Maul and I just like this movie.
Great actors and characters but awful movie
"Weakest of prequel trilogy, enjoyable enough i suppose, needed more maul"
"Bound to disappoint due to overwhelming and unachievable expectations, Phantom Menace lacks the charm and resemblance to the original trilogy, however it does offer great world-building, improved CGI and the best duel in the saga to date."
"Oh boy. I’ll try and be fair. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are good additions as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Darth Maul is an underrated badass. The score is of course phenomenal. And the lightsaber duel is one of the saga’s best. But then you have everything else. Jar Jar Binks was ridiculously annoying, little Anakin’s acting was more wooden than my chair, and some of the racial stereotypes on display are pretty offensive. Every actor gives the same wooden performance and the climax has four different things going on and I’m only really interested in one of them. This movie really let me down."
the movie is fun and entertaining and has things better than episode 7 and 8
"Liam was amazing and Ewan is the perfect Obi-Wan! The problem lies with the awkward Padme and Anakin thing and the over, child-like humor from Jar Jar. Amazing stunts and a nice addition to the lore."
"Darth Maul is why this gets 2 stars. Almost as bad as TLJ, but it actually has a lightsaber fight."
"ok, i know i said i love jar jar and all, and star wars 1-6 but before i wrote this review, i remembered i did have a couple of problems with this film, ok so i know the cgi technology want up to par like it was with attack of the clones and revenge of the sith, cause it was the early 90s but still in some shots like the battle between the droids and gungans it looks like some one copied a droid battleship and pasted it on  the battlefield it was just kindve distracting and jar jar was a bit more annoying in this film, other than that the film is great, like i said the prequels do not deserve the hate they were getting, im going to give this 4 and a half out of 5 stars"
This is probably the best Star Wars movie from the prequel trilogy. It has probably the best lightsaber duel in the entire franchise. Can't understand the low rating....
Disappointing. (nothing more to say)
"Although more family-friendly, cheesy, and in desperate need of lack of Jar Jar, TPM proves to be a beautiful, heartfelt tale to set off the story of Anakin Skywalker."
some of the best music in the entire prequl trilogy and some great duels but...    JAR JAR
"Lacks The Star Wars Action, But Good"
"Better than you remember. The CGI effects have not aged as well as the practical effects in the original trilogy, but it does serve as a slow build to the series. Too much expectation was placed on it at the time to deliver the culmination of a billion fans dreams. In hindsight, it was a decent Sfi-fi flick and a low key start to the prequels."
Nothing I can say about this hasn't been said already.
"Your opinion on this film will depend on how you're approaching it. Die hard fans went in with unrealistic expectations, building a hype that no film could possibly meet. It's not a complete disaster, it does present us with terrific eye candy like the underwater city on Naboo, the pod race is one of the film's high points, and it's supplied with one of the greatest light saber duels in the entire saga. However, that does not make us overlook the cringe worthy dialogue and the two dimensional characters. Tear down the video game facade, and you're left with a rather shallow experience."
Honestly was bad. Anakin and Jar Jar were the worst parts of this film. But Obi-Wan wasnt much better. And the rest of the characters none stood out as good or bad. Just Meh. Loved some of the alien designs.
darth maul is the highlight of this film no doubt
"A well crafted beginning of the evolution of Darth Vader. We meet Anakin Skywalker,a slave working at his master's parts establishment on the planet Tatooine. Jedi Master Jinn,Padawan Kenobi and Padme Amidala, Queen of Naboo we're forced to seek parts for their ship. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious ordered the Trade Federation to blockade Naboo in order to begin the destruction of the Jedi. Sidious has created an enormous army of droids led by the Sith apprentice, Count Dooku and General Grievious. However,the Siths's master plan is put on hold because of the emergence  and discovery of Anakin Skywalker. Skywalker is incredibly strong with the Force. He helps the Jedi and Queen obtain the ship's parts,is freed from slavery and reluctantly leaves his mother to leave with his new friends. Our heros return to Naboo which is under control of the Trade Federation and their battle droids. Jar Jar Binks arranges for a meeting of the Gungan leadership and Queen Amidala and the Jedi. The parties bury enmity and unite to attack the Droid army. As a fierce battle begins the Jedi, Amidala and Naboo warriors who evaded the invasion infiltrate the castle in which the Trade Federation leadership is located. The Jedi are separated from the freedom fighters when Darth Maul confronts them. The Gungan army isn't able to destroy the enormous Trade Federation shield and are being destroyed. Anakin with R2D2 accidentally start up a Naboo fighter and rocket to space joining the small squad of fighters attempting to destroying the Trade Federation ship that controls the entire droid army. Maul kills Master Jinn but is destroyed in turn by Kenobi. Anakin with the Force guiding him destroys the Trade Federation ship shutting down the entire droid army. A celebration begins as the Jedi Council and newly elected Chancellor Palpatine arrive on Naboo. Obi-Wan is elevated as Jedi and assigned to train Anakin. The Jedi discover the dead Sith but worry about the second Sith alive and the rise of the Dark Side. 
     Darth Sidious AKA Senator/Chancellor Palpatine used his Confederate army to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He also knew events would reveal the ""Chosen One."" The Sith also had a clone army being  prepared to destroy the Jedi. However, Palpatine's goal was to have Vallorum replaced by himself . He would build up both the Droid Confederate Army and the Republic Clone Army. Amazing plan to destroy the Jedi,have Darth Vader at his side,and declare himself Emperor. 
     George Lucas brilliantly tells a tale of Palpatine's machinations as well as the emergence of the child who will become Darth Vader."
I am a big Star Wars fan and the phantom menace is top 10 favorite movie of all time
"""The Phantom Menace"" isn't nearly as bad as obsessive fans claim, however, that doesn't mean it comes without it's flaws, some of which that are so large and noticeable, it's understandable why die hard fans were so furious when it was finally shown to the world. It has it's strong moments, the underwater city, the pod race, and one of the best lightsaber duels in the whole saga. But it's impossible to ignore the sloppy direction, dialogue that makes you cringe, and the two dimensional characters."
"Jarjar is so annoying, the dialogue is so cheesy and kiddish, and it is so boring. Nobody wants to see animal as a child. And Darth maul is so weak and disappointing. Even seeing obi wan is disappointing because he is just an ordinary padawan."
"The only truly bad film of this trilogy in my opinion is attack of the clones.
Phantom Menace benefitted from solid performances by Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Natalie portman is good as Padme and even the kid who played Anakin was charming. It doesnt rank with the originals but its a modestly entertaining and well executed sci-fi film. Ignore jar jar binks, wait for the pod racing sequence."
The lightsaber fight at the end makes the child actor worth it.
"It's a good structured film with a great villain that is underused. But the pod race, the gungans, the senator negotiations and weird humot kills this movie. Also the characters are not that well portrayed, specially Anakin."
Star  Wars: The Phantom Menace includes a mix of exciting fight scenes with Darth Maul mixed with annoying characters and a not particularly interesting story line.
"Its better than the next two. qui-gon is a character that makes you care, even though the rest of the movie is full of ham. But its made for kids IMO, so its still a favorite"
Random sh*t that happens in space: A star wars movie
"Lacks much of the comedy and light action that made the originals instant classics. Though, on it's own, without colossal expectations it is not nearly THAT bad."
"Cosa posso dire su questo film che nessuno abbia già detto? Beh, forse che, pur essendo orribile, non è secondo me il peggiore  in assoluto della saga di Star Wars: quel primato spetta al seguito, episodi II. Tuttavia, La Minaccia Fantasma ha tutto quello che serve per risultare uno dei film più odiati della storia del cinema. la storia è incomprensibile ed eccessivamente complicata, i personaggi sono poco interessanti o semplicemente stupidi (il famigerato Jar Jar Binks in primis) e gli effetti speciali sono troppo presenti e con troppa CGI, con il risultato che Yoda, realizzato invece con il vecchio pupazzo, sembra non entrarci niente con l'ambiente circostante. Tutto riguardo questo film non funziona, con poche eccezioni: la scena del triello finale, impreziosito dalla straordinaria musica di John Williams, e la recitazione di Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson e Natalie Portman, le cui performance risultano però rovinate dalla caratterizzazione dei loro personaggi, pressoché inesistenti. Il piccolo Anakin è interpretato da Jake Lloyd, che, sebbene non raggiunga i livelli di inespressività del suo successore Hayden Christensen, non può fare molto per salvare un personaggio fin troppo puerile e ammiccante al pubblico più giovane. In poche parole, se questo film è così odiato e così ricordato come una delle più grandi delusioni della storia del cinema, un motivo c'è... anzi, parecchi motivi. Fatevi un favore e state alla larga dalla trilogia prequel, a meno che non siate dei fan superaccaniti della saga."
"The Phantom Menace is slow and unnecessary, but not as bad as many make it out to be. The Duel of the Fates and the music that goes with it is worth it for me, and the movie offers some explanations for the rest of the movies. However, this movie was definitely a disappointment after the original trilogy."
"Best movie in the history of movies, maybe ever."
I still like this one
Best light saber duel in the series loved it
I can't stand 10 minutes watching ythis.
Is better than the last Jedi but barely.  If not for lightsaber fight at end would be worse than last Jedi.  Jar jar less annoying than rose  Darth maul rules
Very underrated. Excellent battle scenes with a great villain
At least the memes are there. And there are really cool characters like Darth Maul and Qui-Gon. Who doesn't want to see a young Obi-Wan too! I liked the universe better during that time. A better atmosphere and interesting story plots. Heaven forbid they try to have an original story or plot in Star Wars. I like the emphasis on galactic politics and peace. Not just the only 1-2 people who have a light saber.
Very underrated Lucas did a good job on this movie
"Jake Lloyd is bad and Jar Jar is annoying, but its not as bad as people make it out to be."
Weakest of the prequel trilogy. Only saved by acting of Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor. Lightsaber battle at the end was awesome. The killing of Maul was not.
"Not bad not great, darth maul saved the film for me."
"A great film, just not the masterpiece black and white good guys vs bad guys adventure fans where expecting after the long wait between episodes 6 and 1. There are some glaring problems with the film but I find the positives outweigh the negatives in this one."
"Just stop!!! This movie is not bad. Yes Jar Jar Binks was annoying, but if it weren't for him, the queen would have been screwed!!!"
A great film if your really into the EU(Expanded Universe)  content as I am.
"Far from the best film in the series, Phantom Menace would be much better without Gungans or senate hearings. Still , I loved Qui-gon jinn and Darth Maul and Ewan Mcgregor does a stand up job as Obi Wan Kenobi. The duel of fates at the end is one of the best sword fights in cinema and because of that I love this film despite it's many, MANY flaws."
"The movie has a lot of flaws. But it introduces an interesting new Star Wars world, with new types of ships and new lightsabers. And the soundtrack is great. You can criticise it, but you can't deny the greatness of ""Duel of the Fates""."
"It's a Star Wars movie, so I do have some good things to say about it. Darth Maul is an awesome villain, with one of the best lightsabers in the the galaxy. The podracer scene is fun and exciting, too. But There were also a lot of bad things in Episode I as well. Jar Jar Binks is probably the most annoying character in all of Star Wars, and a lot of the story line is cheesy and unrealistic (even for a Star Wars movie)."
"This is still a bad movie. Episode I is the second worst live-action Star Wars film right behind Episode II. It is so boring. Nothing in The Phantom Menace makes any sense, it's like the script was written by an eight-year-old. The story makes no sense. The movie doesn't really even have a plot. A trade federation organization is for some reason really stupid and evil because they get duped by and trust some holographic message of an evil old guy wearing a black robe who looks like Satan. The separatist leaders' space station is shaped like a half-eaten doughnut. Then there is a really annoying, unfunny, stupid, idiotic, racially offensive slapstick cartoonish character named Jar Jar Binks who is an outcast of his race known as Gungans. His own people hate him because he is a big clumsy oaf who accidentally destroyed some valuable ship or something. The two main Jedi in this movie are Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The other characters are Padme Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Mace Windu, Senator Palpatine, Queen Amidala's decoy, Boss Nass, and Darth Maul. The CGI is horrible. The pacing is horrible. The dialogue is terrible. The acting is horrible and emotionless. Even Liam Neeson was wooden as a plank in this movie. A lot of people say Jake Lloyd's acting was the worst in this movie, but it was actually Keira Knightley's acting that was the worst. She spoke every single line with literally zero emotion and had no facial expression throughput the entire film. She was like an android. The characters are cardboard cut-outs including Obi-Wan. None of them have any personality and they're all stoic. We don't get to meet Anakin until like 40 minutes into the film. The pod-racing scene was cool at first, but gets boring after awhile and wastes a lot of time and pacing in the film. Why did Anakin build C3PO? What was the point of him building him? Why did Anakin have to be a nine-year-old kid in this movie? Couldn't he have started out as a fifteen or sixteen-year-old teenager instead? We don't get to meet Yoda until like an hour and half in the film. Why were Midichlorians the reason the Force gets used? In the original trilogy, it was explained that the Force was the binding energy that surrounds the galaxy. In this movie, it's stated that the Force is energy coming from microorganisms inside cells of living beings that tell them the ways of the Force and when to use it. Such a huge continuity error. Darth Maul is a Sith who barely talks in this movie. He only has like 3 or 4 lines in this movie. He was a wasted villain. The only good scenes in this movie are the pod race and the final lightsaber battle with Darth Maul which was actually cool.

Rating: 4.5/10"
"What the film lacks in good dialogue it is the first step into the larger universe of Star Wars and its complexity. Overall a good film, it is not the original trilogy but it is a good film."
The weakest of the prequels
"This film really dragged. The podrace was too long and the film tries to explain too many things. Points off for Jar-Jar. If you want to see how this could have been a better movie, watch ""The Phantom Edit"""
"This movie was way ahead of its time. If we reexamine this film, we will all realize what a precious gem it is. Sure, there are flaws, but they are overwhelmingly outweighed by the dramatic masterpiece that kicks off the prequel trilogy."
"Although not the best movie ever, it has some awesome fight scenes, and epic music. It was good returning to the star wars universe again. And it certainly is better than the cinematic failure, The Last Jedi..."
"Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a good prequel to the Skywalker Saga but lacks the action that Star Wars movies should have. Two Jedi Knights escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force, but the long dormant Sith resurface to claim their old glory.

It has great visual effects and this prequel really shows how they met Anakin Skywalker. This film is the Star Wars film that people were really waiting for so that's why it got over a billion at the box office. My favourite scene is when Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi fight Darth Maul because that scene has the most action. My only problem with this movie is that it doesn't have enough Star Wars action, compared to the other films. The film is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.  I would recommend this film to Star Wars fan who have not yet seen the prequels.

Grade B+"
"This was painful.

I remember watching this film when it was released. I was eleven years old, and I loved it.

Watching it now, at 30, I could barely finish it. I understand, now, that children were the intended target audience.

Jar Jar Binks is possibly the singular worst thing to ever happen to the Star Wars films. Annoying and unnecessary does not even begin to describe the character.

The script is abysmal, and subsequently there is not a single noteworthy performance in the whole of film. Liam Neeson and Ian McDiarmid give passable attempts, but nothing ever rises above mediocre.

The CGI may have been good for the time, but it has not aged well. The practical effects of the original trilogy surpass the eyesore that is The Phantom Menace by an easy mile.

The plot is simple and mundane and boring and does not warrant the excessive run time. The Trade Federation is angry about some taxes, so they invade Naboo. That's it. That's literally the entire plot of The Phantom Menace.

The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting. There's literally no character development or background given for anyone. Who is Darth Maul? Where did he come from? Who is Qui-Gon Jinn? Who is Queen Amidala? Why should the viewer care about any of them?

What a nightmare."
"At first I hated this movie like everyone else. I thought Jar Jar and Anakin were annoying. But when you watch it with the fact that Jar Jar is a Sith controlling everything in mind, this movie is sick."
Worth seeing just for the pod race and darth maul
Annoying characters take magic and fun out of Star Wars.
"A movie that is actually worse than you remember it, like a lot worse. The CGI looks bad and is over used, most of the movie is boring, the acting is uninspiring (especially the kids), the writing is way worse than I remember it and there are many of the alien-characters that leave you speechless in their awfulness. I could stack up more minor problems and things I just don't like but I would instead like to talk about the most off-putting thing:

Jar Jar Binks is just as awful as people on the internet says he is. He might be worse in my opinion. He is supposed to be a comic-relief but he is never funny, not once. He ruined every singel scene he was in and is so unbelievable that the whole movie loses its credibility. Like why is he a part of the crew? He shows them the way to the stupid underwater king (who is also very dumb) and that should be the end of him, but it isn't! Why? Why would they keep the complete idiot and useless dude around? Why is promoted all the time? Why does he talk the way he does, it is not funny just stupid? Its like the Avengers would just pick up a random non-powered hobo who is mildly retarded and just say: ""Hey man do you wanna be a part of this super important mission to save the universe?"" He also looks very ugly. 

No matter what anyone says, the new ones ARE better than this. Not sorry."
"The only reason to see this movie, is for Liam Neeson, and of course Ewan McGregor who is just fabulous as Obi-Wan."
"Jar Jar Binks, why?? So pleased he was given a lesser role in the subsequent movies."
I fucking loved it more than the last Jedi
I was so excited to finally get the prequel and this movie was a let down. It's still watchable and the movies progress better. Jar Jar really ruins it and Anakin is really annoying here.
The first of the Star Wars prequel trilogy kicks off with poor pacing and a boring plot.
"The chronological first of the episodic Star Wars films, and the first Star Wars film in quite some time, TPM had a lot riding on it. The trailer looked fantastic, we had a new lightsaber design, and the world was excited. And then...it came out. Flat performances, a bumbling slapstick character, complicated and nonsensical plot, and trying to accomplish too much leave this movie feeling both half baked and burned at the same time. By Lucas's own admission, he went too far in some places. Tonally it's a bit all over the shop, as we go from celebration to the death of a hero, to another odd moment with jar jar, to a funeral and then again to a celebration. All in all, it's not the worst film I've ever seen but it is FAR from the best."
The Phantom Menace shows that George Lucas has a great imagination and that he can churn out some great scenes here and there - such as the famous Darth Maul fight - but it unfortunately also shows that the overall quality of the film can't live up the idea on paper.
"Atrocious. Of the three worst Star Wars films, I rank this as the worst, followed closely by Clones and then Last Jedi. Fans waited for years to see a whiny 9 year old Jake Lloyd. He makes Threepio but somehow forgets decades later. Midicholorians ruin the mysticism of the Force. The droids are boring villains. Someone had to play Jar Jar Binks, who until Last Jedi was unquestionably worst Star Wars character (Rose and Holdo are the nee challengers).."
"IT's very good. not great. It's not great because Darth Maul was underused. It also started with taxation and trade issues, which seemed to contrast the space fantasy adventure that is Star Wars. But still a very enjoyable film I have watched many times."
"While its not the best, The Phantom Menace is still an enjoyable Star Wars feature."
"Not as bad as they say, I enjoyed myself. Still not very good, though."
"Quite bad, but the new ones are even worse."
Jar jar binks and darth maul what more do you want
It enriches the SW universe. It must be seen as a part of a modern greek tragedy. Georges creativity is incredible.
The only remotely good thing is the pod race. And even that's shit.
Borring and some characters were oful
THIS IS A GARBAGE MOVE WITH NO REDEEMING QUALITIES!
Has its moments but overall really bad.
"This movie has far too many politics and bad acting, but sort of makes up for it with scenes like the Pod Race and the Darth Maul fight."
"I enjoyed it, but not as good as the O.T."
"The most imaginative of all the series, keying up the masterpiece story arc. As usual, hollywood is the party that can't make heads or tails of the script, applying it's ever present handicapp."
Love the pod racing and lightsaber duel. I enjoy this one.
I enjoy this movie. Don't get all the hate
"Cool visual effects, even better fight scenes.  Pod racing was fun to watch as the movie explained Skywalker's origins"
"Unfortunately, George Lucas has lost the cinematic prowess he was once famous for, replacing extraordinary practical effects and cinematography for wooden dialogue and aging cgi"
Very Underrated film. I personally enjoy it very much.
I really enjoy this movie.
A masterpiece of a film.
"Pros: score, Darth Maul, some performances
Cons: effects, Jar Jar Binks, most performances"
"I liked this film, saw it in the cinema. Don't know what people problem is."
"This movie has great moments like the light saber battle but there is a lot of bad problems like Anakin, rubbish script, not a good story and too much Jar Jar Binks."
"Star Wars fans often give The Phantom Menace more hate than it deserves. Before everyone gets out their pitchforks, I don't think it is a good film. I merely consider it not to be the worst Star Wars film - that dubious honor goes to Attack of the Clones. While The Phantom Menace is not a good film, with boring or annoying heroes and non-threatening or underdeveloped villains, it is saved from complete awfulness by an exciting final battle and an excellent score.

The main issue I have with The Phantom Menace is that the main characters are at all least one of the following: badly written, badly acted, or underutilized. Jar Jar is a general irritant, a poorly executed comic relief character who is often used by fans of the series as a symbol of their dislike of the prequels. Natalie Portman gives a mediocre performance as Padme and her character has some cringe-worthy dialogue, especially when talking to Anakin. As for Anakin, Jake Lloyd gives a poor performance (which doesn't make the vitriol the poor kid received any more acceptable - he's a child actor being directed by George Lucas, after all) and is written as a sort of child genius who is special in every possible way (the chosen one, Force sensitive, an expert at building droids and podracers, an ace pilot, etc.), reminiscent of a younger version of the much-despised Wesley Crusher over on Star Trek. As for Qui Gon and Obi Wan, they are much more tolerable, but the film does little of interest with either character over the course of the movie.

The portrayal of the antagonists is also the source of some of the issues with this film. At the beginning of A New Hope, the film shows stormtroopers clearing the Tantive IV of rebel soldiers while sustaining minimal casualties. This builds them up as menacing adversaries, something that is frequently forgotten given their later portrayals. The battle droids, on the other hand, spend their first few scenes being effortlessly reduced to piles of spare parts by the Jedi. The Neimoidians are equally nonthreatening, with a portrayal as greedy, incompetent cowards. This creates an issue for the entire trilogy and most of the spin offs set during this period, as it makes the main villains hard to take seriously. While Darth Maul is more menacing and has an awesome character design, he never receives any backstory or motivation - much like the criticism fans had about Snoke in The Last Jedi, except Maul is built up to a greater degree.

While The Phantom Menace is possibly one of the most despised film of its decade, the film has some positive aspects which prevent it from being entirely terrible. The score is one of John Williams' finest works, with ""Duel of the Fates"" being a particular standout. A lot of work also obviously went into designing the sets, starships, and planets, although the extensive use of CGI leads to the world looking less real than that depicted in the Original Trilogy. However, neither of these is the reason why I'm more forgiving of this film than Attack of the Clones. One scene elevates The Phantom Menace slightly - the climactic battle between the two Jedi and Darth Maul, set to the aforementioned ""Duel of the Fates"". This fight is one of the best lightsaber duels of the franchise and more exciting than anything else the next film in the franchise would offer.

Despite the flashy effects and an enjoyable lightsaber duel, there is no way I can recommend Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Most of the film is either boring or cringey. It is possible for a film with a mediocre plot and characters to stand out solely based of its action scenes and visuals. A New Hope, while blessed with interesting characters and worldbuilding, was successful in large part due to its innovative visuals. An even better example is Avatar, which broke box office records because of its visuals, not its insipid plot or forgettable characters. The major difference is that these films had numerous scenes throughout the movie showcasing their strengths. The Phantom Menace spends too much of its runtime on pointless or boring scenes which provide little in the way of entertainment."
"This would be one of the strongest entries into the Star Wars saga if not for the fact of it coming off the original trilogy (and the notoriously bad Jar Jar Binks.)
-7/10"
"I love how people say they hate it but have absolutely no logical reasons why. ""Cringey."" Really? Where? At what point? You just sound like some ass-hurt people who simply aren't fans of the sci-fi genre. A genuine dislike comes from critiquing the film's score, script. At what time exactly is dialogue awful? This shit's a grade A movie, gtfo here with your shitty comments. The film is beautifully made, has great visuals and effects, musical score is iconic, some scenes are considered classics such as the final fight against Darth Maul. Please, if you're going to write some shitty comment back it up with some facts instead of your shitty emotional complaints."
Really fun movie with some interesting and cool characters and fun action.
Adds a lot to the franchise overall.
I grew up with this film and enjoy it very much.
Worthy Star wars entry. I don't understand all the hate.
"Very UNDERRATED! Gets to much hate for stupid reasons. Good visuals, some cool new characters, and entertaining action."
Midichlorians - Simple. ohhh...
Overall I enjoy this film. Jar Jar can be a little over the top but he doesn't ruin the movie. best lightsaber duel in the sage and some amazing action. Ewan Mcregar and Liam Neeson have great performances. Overall the positives outweigh the negatives.
"The first film in a trilogy of prequels exploring the origins of the original trilogy's main villain and father of its main character, Anakin Skywalker came to the world 16 years after Return of the Jedi. While in that period of time, George Lucas, the creator of this franchise, was trying to get the best out of visual effects, it's safe to say he wasn't training in order to improve on his storytelling or filmmaking skills; ""The Phantom Menace"" is shockingly inferior to the original Star Wars trilogy films. When the planet Naboo is blockaded by the Trade Federation, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi are asked to negotiate with the Federation Viceroy. They are not aware though that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious has planned a trap for them. One thing leads to another and the two Jedi soon find themselves in a mission to rescue Padmé Amidala, Queen of Naboo and coming across the young Anakin Skywalker, which has advanced Force skills, believing he is ""the chosen one"".  Despite the interesting plotting, the execution is very problematic. The tone is extremely inconsistent, the character of Jar Jar Binks is straight up annoying and cringe worthy, most of the dialogue is overly clichéd and unnatural, there are several pacing issues and while the visuals are top notch, there is way too much of them. Shutout to the actors - most of them - for managing to rise above the mediocrity of the script. The film also delivers on the action and without doubt with its powerfully composed score, once again by the mastermind John Williams. All in all, a very polarizing experience."
It's a really good movie not listen to anyone who says it isn't. The only bad part in the movie is the jar jar Binks parts. Liam makes a wonderful Jedi.
Better than some believe and I like it even more since the Disney junk came out
"Much better than soylo. With a little ironing out, This movie could have been even greater. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
2nd best Star Wars film.
"Boring movie, exept for every qui-gon quote."
I thought it was pretty good
"Not a bad story, but lots of lost potential.  More focus on the jedi and Maul and less on galactic politics would've made it shine.  One of the best scores of the franchise with an amazing lightsaber duel can't keep this one from being mostly boring world building.  The pod race is fun as is the last battle.  The robotic dialogue and mostly bland characters are the prequels bane."
"Um... ok, I really liked how the prequel’s are but you can do better"
"Lots of Fun, great Star wars film, acting a bit flakey"
Darth Maul...that's about it
Very good movie highly recommended
Master piece movie. Phantom menace is amazing masterpiece and a good franchise don't listen to the haters they killed Star Wars
Most amazing movie and best of the franchise. This movie is masterpiece and it made Star Wars to love this fans those toxic fans should have regret of what they did to the Franchise
"Never understood why there was so much hate for this movie as i find it to be pretty good all around. aside from too much jar jar at times, it's a very enjoyable watch."
Ummm... yeah. Not as bad as most preach it is but not exactly the highlight of the Star Wars Franchise or any of the actors in it.
"The best of this movie is the best of the entire prequels.  Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul is easily the best fight ever in a SW movie.  Their story arc more than makes up for the dreadful Jar Jar scenes and syrupy sweet young Anakin Skywalker.  Also, Naboo is the most wonderful location Lucas ever created, making TPM the most beautiful of all the SW movies. Naboo is the only place in the SW universe I'd want to live.  TPM has a bit too much of the goofy humor and the pod race goes on a bit too long.  Just stick around till the end.  You won't be disappointed!"
"All unmet 1999 fanboy expectations aside, I can now watch The Phantom Menace with different eyes now that I know where Luas and the broader Star Wars Universe was going. I can appreciate the whole midichlorians, Chosen One, etc components that in 1999, pissed me off. However, the first 20 minutes of Episode I are still the worst 20 minutes of the 6 film stretch. Getting past them is hard, but once I do, I'm sucked in and, despite the subpar acting and even less impressive dialogue, I'm too in love with the whole Star Wars thing that I'm immediately in line for this 3D version. Seeing Episode I, not filmed in 3D, rotoscoped to appear 3D is absolutely elementary. We are talking ILM, here. And even they couldn't get it right. Unless you want to experience Episode I in the theater again, don't waste your money on the 3D."
"I loved this film when I was a kid... now that I grew up I can understand why viewers had some issues with the film . while it's not what we all expected, I have to say it's still an AVERAGE film due to the epic music score and battles here and there."
After the new movies prequels are now great movies
Not gonna lie i really like this movie saw it 3 times in theatres probably 30 times at home
"Somewhere, in the editing room, I'm sure there's a good movie here."
"so much potential but fell short.  the best part of the movie is the battle of darth maul.  the worst part, oh look by some fluke accident anakin's fighter ship flies into on of the space stations that happens to be the one that controls all the droids and other space attack stations and then destroys it from the inside out."
Eh. Drawn out but pretty decent.
"I actually like this movie a lot more than most it seems. The sheer awfulness of young Anakin and Jar Jar is offset by the sheer brilliance of the score and the final lightsaber duel, which is by far the best in the whole Saga."
"Good effects for the time, amazing soundtrack, cool design over all and a nice reboot to the series. 
Episode 8 pales in comparison."
It only gets a star for Liam Neeson and nothing else writing was awful
"you don't even need to watch the movie to know the plot is going to suck.""Taxation of trade routes"",""The greedy trade federation""(wow looks like George lucas was directing this movie towards kids (I.E pod racing)).Jar Jar is the dumbest character in all of star wars,Anakin is annoying,and could they just remove the midiclorian scene. overall its all trash(besides duel of the fates (half a star for that))"
"It has some good moments (like the action scenes, the pod-race scene, John Williams's score, Ewan's Obi-Wan, Liam's Qui-Gon and Lightsaber duel with Darth Maul) but the rest is terrible... no wait I'll take it back... IT""S HORRIBLE and it scared my childhood for life."
"Star Wars : Episode I-The Phantom Menace is a very good film,but it uses a lot of CGI"
"Way too political. Has a few interesting moments, especially at the end, but just isn't what we wanted from a Star Wars movie."
This movie was simply meh
Jar Jar was a mistake. ‘Nuff said.
this film has a better plot than the last jedi.
"Review for all prequels. I know the prequels get a lot of shade from people and I understand why, CGI isn't the best, acting is kind of bad at parts and the pacing is weird too, but the prequels have given us some really amazing things as well like, the back story of darth vader, a look at the clone wars, darth maul and duel of the fates, and young obi wan. If George Lucas didn't push for the CGI work in the prequels, ILM wouldn't be where they are now. Both the the Originals and Prequels pushed the boundaries of CGI. Lastly the story is there, its just not executed properly, but a remake is out of the question."
darth maul survived i watched solo this film biggest downfall for me was his death but now he survived my experience watching this film will be better knowing he survived somehow
"In retrospect, there is a fair amount to appreciate for Star Wars fans. The world building is good and I don't mind some exposition. I do wish the battle droids were a bit more menacing and that Anakin started off as a young adult instead."
"The writing is uninteresting, the acting is wooden the effects doesn't look promising, the comedy is childish."
"The prequels are highly underrated. The main issues: 
the pacing, some of the dialogue/writing and of course 
jar jar. But the action is great, it has a great soundtrack/score, the political intrigue fascinated me and 
Makes the world seem believable and immersive. That's just my opinion I love the prequels as much as the originals and wish they get more love than they do."
the fight at the end if one of the best ever.
I guess it took a lot of actually bad movies to make me realize this actually wasn't that bad. Aside from the jar jar fart scene on tatooine and ani's acting (which is understandable considering his age and that it follows well with how George directed hayden in the following films) this movie is actually fun. The podracing scene is visually beautiful and exciting.
Jar Jar haunts my dreams.
Saved in the last 20 minutes
"Loopings at the new Star Wars movies, I have to give this one a better rating."
better than SJW wars
Worst movie of all time.
"not that great of a movie, still okay but certainly not great. Darth Maul is a great character, Qui-Gon Jin is also pretty cool in this movie, but it was just kind of boring. Still better than Episode 2 though."
Great soundtrack. Great costumes. Great lightsaber duel. Great vilain and great Qui-Gon Jin. Better than the new ones.
Still better than the new ones
Lightsaber fight scene at the end is the only thing good about this trash of a movie.
"The worst possible introduction of the greatest villian of all time. The Podracing scene still is one of the best scenes in history when it comes to soundmixing and editing. Neeson is okay, Jar Jar's George biggest failure and mistake. McGregor and Maul are outstanding. 3 1/2*"
"When compared to the Last Jedi or Force awakens, this movie is a epic worthy of every major film award."
"Star Wars the Phantom Menace was ok, there are Jedi and they are the good guys and the Sith are bad guys, they want to take control of the galaxy. As for Jedi they are providing peas to the galaxy for every one. Now who will win! There is a boy Anakin Skywalker keep in mind will he be a Jedi soon"
I so need a Nubian ship!
Worst star wars movie ever made
darth maul and quigon jin are the only good characters in the beginning of anakin skywalker's story. but they both die.  and midichlorians are the source of the force? what happened to life being the source? crap
Great movie compared to the new ones
Holds up a lot more after dealing with Disney Star Wars
"2/5.  The podrace and the final duel are both awesome, Darth Maul is an awesome looking villain, and Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are fine, but The Phantom Menage has a dull story that doesn't make much sense, along with characters that are ether boring or cringeworthy."
"I enjoyed the movie, Special Effects have come a long way since the original trilogy. Jar Jar is very annoying, Minor spoiler, After Qui-gon and Obi-wan get through the planet core, they should have force choked Jar Jar."
Three stars for Darth Maul alone!
just needed more Maul
Nothing more to say.  Awful.
In retrospect... not as bad as we thought Star Wars could be...
Mee teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa!
Loved it I could watch it for 24 hours straight.
"The Phantom Menace crafts an interesting and well weaved storyline of what took place even longer ago in the galaxy crafted since the original Star Wars. While most critics are quick to judge, watching this film shows that the direction was to show and set up how the Jedi came to be all extinct to line up the Saga with the original films. The politics do not bore in the slightest as Sidious plots out how he plans to defeat the Jedi by using the galaxy's very own people against them. However, while this film was entertaining, it holds up mistakes - the biggest one clearly being the inclusion of Jar Jar Binks. The climax of the film brings together the future of how we may see the story of the Jedi's end and the birth of Darth Vader in a trilogy starter."
"This movie sets the stage for a trilogy that disappointed me. The greatest failing in this movie, and for the trilogy as a whole, is a matter of pacing. A focus on CGI graphics over characters makes for a movie that cannot hold up."
I love this movie!!!!
Not great but it feels like a star wars movie looks lile a star wars movie and shows a world before the empire. Still fun to watch.
"It has its flaws but overall, it's an engaging and entertaining movie that left me wanting to see more of what Star Wars had to offer.  The acting wasn't always great, but with the script they were given, it's hard to blame the actors.  Despite that, most of the characters in this movie were great.  The fights were amazing.  The action scenes were mostly great.  Some slow political processes in the movie, but they didn't take away from the movie.  They were important in explaining why things were happening the way they were.  Overall, it felt like a Star Wars movie and made me want more."
Not as bad as everyone makes out.
Jar jar. Midiclorians. Pod racing. A fight that lasts a few seconds. Nuff said.
Better than Disney's Star Wars
Loved this film - totally underrated by people who either haven't seen it or watched it as a kid. It has aged really well too.
Great non Disney film
"and the pod racing scene went on for too long. Other than that, though, an unfairly maligned good movie."
"The Phantom Menace gets a lot of backlash for Jar Jar, but in the end, it is still a great star wars movie.  You get an incredible pod race scene, a great villian(who died too soon), an awesome lightsaber duel, and the Duel of the Fates is the best music in Star Wars."
Not as strong of a start as one had hoped but it does at least introduce you to Anakin and Kenobi plus more.
loved the movie. too many people hop on the prequel hate band wagon. bet the good things defiently out shined the bad
better than the crap the release now
"I don't want to be mean. I understand that the actors were just doing their jobs. As far as that goes, they did their jobs well. But I can't stand the characters of Jar Jar and Anakin. They ruined a movie that could have been good."
FEATUres the best lightsaber scene in all of Star Wars.
"Probably an unpopular opinion. I actually liked The Phantom Menace.
Better than the fucking Sequels. Chris Stuckmann are you actually fucking retarded."
"Boring at times,really interesting at other times..Introduced us to a great villain in Darth Maul."
i loved this film i hope they do a backstory on darth maul
"The Phantom Menace shows that Lucas forgot what made Star Wars great, with dull characters and a boring plot."
"Just hate Jar JAR JAR ... WHY .. WHHHHY .. remove that thing and the movie would be a lot better. Kinda messed up with ""mediclorians"""
"Best lightsaber battle of any Star Wars movie, with Revenge of the Sith a close 2nd."
"""The Phantom Menace"" is easily the worst in the ""Star Wars"" Saga, but is still an enjoyable film."
"A very nice start of the advanture, filled with action and good acting. Pod racing scene was just very painfull to watch."
"Love all Originals and Prequels, wish I could say the same for the Sequels"
"This movie is hands down, the most tragic and horrible films I think i've ever seen. The feel we got in the original trilogy is completely gone in this film, it was replaced by George Lucas' ideas for making star wars a children's toy. Although I would agree that star wars is   definetely favored by kinds, Luca way over did it. Overall the only appeasing thing about this film is the pod race, and the amazing lightsaber fight that blowed all of our minds. Unfortunetly, to get to the duel with Darth Maul, we need to go through 110 minutes of terrible acting, dialogue, humor, CGI, and script writing. The Phantom Menace was terrible, horrific and a crime to us all, thank you George Lucas for wrecking star wars."
"Well the film had a couple of isolated details that could have been much better, but overall was a good experience. And I'm giving it a high score, because this film started the second wave of characters, worlds and situations that expanded the Star Wars universe. 
In retrospective the prequels did a great job presenting us new interesting and iconic things, places, situations, scenes and characters like Qui Gon, Mace Windu, Darth Maul. 
My favorite characters of the prequels were Obi Wan, Yoda and Palpatine, this films did a good job really making justice to those characters..........That's something that we cannot say with the new trilogy which is making so far a terrible work with the old characters, and specially with the most loved and important character in the whole Star Wars: Luke Skywalker."
"Good Film overall, never going to please everyone, hated Jar Jar but i'm over it now, my Kids like him, and the film can be watched as a family. Lightsaber Battle with Darth Maul one of the best in the franchise, overall 4 stars. Revenge of the Sith is by far the worst film of the prequils not this. TLJ needs to be struck from Cannon, JJ open the next film with Poe waking up saying I had a bad dream, and ignore it all. or we will ignore star wars from now on."
I honestly think that this movie sucked. there was a total of 2 good scenes (pod-race and Maul fight scene) but besides that it is just boring to watch.
Well at least the final Lightsaber battle was good.
Poor start only saved by the duel of the fates....
"Not a perfect movie but adds a lot to the star wars lore. Padme, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul are great characters in the franchise."
"Star wars: The Phantom menace brings many laughs in an elaborate and clever satire of the science/fiction fantasy genre, skillfully parodying ""the chosen one"" trope, and poking fun at major sci-fi staples such as star wars and spaceballs."
"Despite this moive's rough diagloue, it expands the Star wars universe in perfect was: planets, people, the Jedi and Sith, as well as seting it up for more moives to come"
I liked the movie. It introduced us to Darth Jar Jar people! I hope he comes back in ep.9.
"Peel away the sheep cover and stop living by society’s opinion, and all of a sudden, you realize The Phantom Menace is a good Star Wars movie. For many years I’ve been preaching how TPM is not the worst Star Wars movie. I always got the same response, but after The Last Jedi came out, people started agreeing with me. The Phantom Menace is given a difficult task. The task is starting off one of the most prolific, profitable, known franchises of all time, all the while keeping the pace racing to cover the amount of story they had to cover in a trilogy. The movie starts quickly, and is action packed. Director and creator of Star Wars George Lucas did not hesitate in showing off the new Star Wars. Many hate on the movie for being “boring”. The movie, I’m reasonably lengthened segments, has quite sophisticated talks regarding negotiations, trade talks, and other politics. Non-star wars fans hate it, but must realize politics were a huge part of TPM time period and the Republic. The action scenes are fantastic. They leave you wanting more, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, played by legendary Liam Neeson, does as he does best and leads this movie, making it its best. Qui-Gon’s padiwan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is played by Ewan McGregor. He shines as well, and now no one else shall be known as Obi-Wan than him. These 2 Jedi, two of the most important characters in the grand scheme of Star Wars, face off against a true Sith assassin, the apprentice to Darth Sidious, Darth Maul himself. Maul arises on Tatooine, in search of Padmè Amidala (Natalie Portman), young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and their ship. Qui-Gon Jinn senses the dark presence, saving Anakin for the time being and facing off against Darth Maul. Qui-Gon realizes, his green lightsaber connected against Maul’s double-bladed red one, that this is the first known Sith in over 1000 years. The Phantom Menace has brief moments where dialogue is clunky, especially in the first 15-20 minutes of the film. It seems Lucas wrote this portion earlier, and came back to the script. However, it is easily looked over and grows on the viewer over time. The only real negative of the movie is Jar Jar Binks, but even he is not too bad. The Phantom Menace kicks off the Stars Wars franchise with action, awe, and tragedy. Rating: 86% 4.5/5"
Better then Last Jedi.
"Kind of annoying at times, but honestly get hated on too much. It’s really not that bad and has some great moments like Pod Racing and the Darth Maul lightsaber fight"
"Highly enjoyed this movie. Took off stars because young anakin was horrible; and pod racing sucked. Although anakin blowing up the trade federation blockade was awesome. Parts I loved, the huge palace battle. Always loved the Naboo royal guard, only place that seems to have a decent fighting force against the droids, other than clones. The Naboo Air Force ships are awesome as well. Plus, the best part was obi wan killing maul. Watched this movie many times!"
"Star Wars The Phantom Menace was a pretty good movie I was hoping for more action and battle but I know that the Trilogy gets better. There is the Jedi that make peace and justice, and there is the Sith they are all about power along with revenge. Now there is this young boy named Anakin Skywalker who may be a Jedi find out what will happen Star Wars is a good Trilogy"
Underreted only for stupid nostalgic fans. But EP 1 is madre by the love of the author.
The whole movie was just boring. Didn't hold up to the original trilogy.
"One of the biggest disappointments ever. The CGI is over-used and terrible, the characters and boring and borderline frustrating. Whilst it has a good score and practical elements, it falls flat of any emotion and spoils the magic of the origional films."
"You've got Qui Gon, Darth Maul, Duel of the Fates (Fight scene and music), young Obi Wan, the pod race, and practical effects. But this is the worst Star Wars movie? No.
Completely misunderstood and underappreciated. One of the best of the prequels."
Most decent intro movie to among star wars trilogies
"The film had some good ideas but ultimately the execution is poor with a bland story, dull new characters, an over-abundance of CGI and the character known as Jar-Jar Binks."
"not kill me bad, but bad...."
"Worst movie ever made. Sorry Lucas, it´s the reality."
"Despite presenting with a brand new story, interesting political topics and delivering what probably remains as the best light saber fight in the entire franchise (choreography wise) and a very well shot and produced pod race, the film suffers heavily from poor dialogue and terrible pacing. The execution is very lackluster, but from very some unique visuals to a fantastic musical score, there's stuff to enjoy here."
Ugh...urm epic musical score great light saber fights...
Better than the attack of the clones
Better than Attack of the Clones but still not what I was expecting
"This is a decent movie. Childhood nostalgia holds it up even as it drags on, and as long as you abide by the understanding that Jar Jar Binks is secretly a Sith Lord, it makes for a much better watch than some may have you think."
You claim you hated it now but I saw you in the theatre cheering when Maul fought Quigon.
"One of my all time favorites, Liam Neeson as a Jedi? yeah he nails it!"
"As a kid I loved this film, as an adult? I still love this film, yes there's definitely problems but I think Lucas was allowed to make mistakes since it's his first time directing a Star Wars film since A New Hope and I was definitely entertained. Ewan McGregor was a great choice as Obi Wan, Darth Maul was awesome (even though I wish we got more of him), the Pod Race was cool, John Williams Score is amazing and I do admire Lucas for giving us something completely different than the Original Trilogy."
"This wasn't the best Star Wars film, but at least there are pretty cool lightsaber battles!"
"I like The Phantom Menace alot, and honestly i don't understand all the hate. People say it's slow and boring, but those are the same people who love ESB. They bash it for Jar Jar and gungans, but many of them liked Ewoks and Porgs. Darth Maul's story wasn't explored as much as it should be, and that's a real problem, movies are only as good as their villains are, which the guy who created Vader should understand. I would rate the movie 4 or higher if they put more focus on his character, instead of making him a villain of the week. Luckily Lucas understood his mistake and greenlit his resurrection in Clone Wars, but that's another Story. As for the rest of the characters that people criticize: many disliked Qui-Gon, but to me he's easily one of the most interesting Jedi masters. Little Anakin wasn't bad at all, Jake Lloyd was actually a really good child actor, and making his character older wouldn't have the same effect. Padme in her Geisha getup looks amazing, though i agree she lacks the charisma that Leia had, and Jar Jar wasn't  as bad as people say, especially now, knowing the original plans Lucas had for him, i can't help but enjoy his character. Obi-Wan wasn't given enough to do in the movie, but he more than made up for it in future installments. The Podrace was great, but the preparations leading to it kind of dragged a little, that was the only part of the movie i can see being slightly boring. Midichlorians didn't ruin the force, that's another thing most fans misunderstood. I think people expected Empire Strikes Back 2.0 but even more dark and brutal, and they got the exact opposite, a lighthearthed adventure movie targeted at children. Which wasn't a bad idea at all, there was an entire generation who grew up on the prequels and became fans because of them, me included. A movie targeted at older audience might not have the same effect."
Qui-Gon Jinn dies. Darth Maul dies. Awesome movie
"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is a movie that succeeds on the visual and action front adding  a great frontier to this movie. But, when you have mostly annoying and unbalanced characters, tedious politics sessions, terrible story and a lot of exposition, this movie falls flat quite quickly."
"Two cultists find young boy and abduct him to enlist in cult, then fight satan with glowsticks"
"A simply terrible movie. It should not even be mentioned in the same sentence with the original trilogy. Awful acting, incredibly cringeworthy to say the least, makes this movie hard to watch. The visuals are far from stunning. Films like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, made only two years afterwards, puts this movie to shame. This movie at best, is shameful to the Star Wars saga."
"I enjoyed it, very underrated film for having the best lightsaber duel of all time!!"
"Is incredibly innovated with incredible backgrounds, has a kids comedy that felt very shocking because of the contrast with the political drama plot that has, also has sweet characters that felt real in it and good action sequences"
"I so wanted this to be better!  But still, any Star Wars movie is better than most movies out there"
Give this one more credit.  Lucas did a great job and this is the direction he wanted to go in.
"When it came out the theaters were full for weeks. The bad comments didn't come till later when the Internet created the copy cats. Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn make it a great movie. The robots had to be show as an insufficient force, thus the need for the Clone army to be more effective. The technology and story couldn't outshine New Hope or it would seem like the galaxy when backward by the time of the Death Star. Thus Lucas walked that line.
Yes, Jar Jar and the Gungan's could have been done better, but the rest of the movie was strong."
"Should have been better, so much of this movie could be cut out and you's loose nothing from the overall story. THough one of the best lightsaber fights in a Star Wars movie"
worst sequel of all time
Is it odd for me to like the pod race? 2nd to the light saber duel of cource ...
"I appreciate this movie a lot more!!!!, after that mess of a movie that is Episode 8."
"Fun, exiting, with an interesting lore, star wars the phantom menace still managed to tell a better story than a large portion of storytelling today."
cuando tenia 13 años me daba igual star wars pero ví esta pelicula y me empecé a viciar. soy de los que me gusta el episodio 1. mucho más que las de disney.
"La amenaza fantasma se ha convertido en una cinta incomprendida,  principalmente por dos factores: los frikis de star wars y su poca amplitud de miras, y una critica reticente e impostadamente reacia a la ciencia ficción en general. Más allá de estos prejuicios injustos, subyace una película muy especial, que se yergue descomunal sobre todo lo demás. Su mayor logro tal vez sea confeccionar el mundo de ficción más maravilloso e interesante que el septimo arte haya visto jamás: Naboo. Un universo rebullente rebosante de magia y creatividad, con el reino como eje central de la trama. Es posiblemente el realengo naboo, con su preciosista y estilizada estética neo-renacentista, lo mejor que esta saga ha dado en tantas películas. No solo ofrece un majestuoso espectaculo visual, sino que además de su pompa fastuosa hay toda una reivindicación del mito de la diosa, encarnada por una Natalie Portman  imponente, solemne hasta la magnificiencia en sus galas de reina, y carismática heroína intrépida en sus escenas de  acción. Probablemente la parte del desierto sea la más farragosa; es la única pega: el no ver más de esa pompa bombátisca, que fuese tan breve contemplar esa elegancia, podriamos decir ya por derecho propio , ""nabusiana""."
"Look, I know this movie has flaws.  I don't care.  I waited for this movie for years.  I devoured any information I could find out.  I wanted the second trilogy that Lucas had promised.  I knew it wasn't perfect, and at 19, I knew it couldn't be perfect.  It was fun!  It was so much fun because I wasn't stupid enough to whine about the minutia and just watch the damn movie and that badass podracing scene.  Oh, dear, the lightsaber battles are unemotional dances, and they are delightful, fast-paced kung-fu exhibitions.  You get the same from Chinese action films.  You don't complain about those!  Jar Jar Binks?  Yeah, there was too much of him, but I didn't dislike him.  There could have been less of him, but he wasn't a completely incompatible character.  Bad CGI?  It was all relatively new, and it was the best at the time.  Please, find me a movie from 1999 with better CGI.  Somehow, it's supposed to hold up to the 2010s?  This can't be the hill you're choosing to die on.  Star Wars has never been made for art critics.  It's made for people who want to switch their brains off and just have a blast, and if you can unpucker your asses long enough to stop whining problems that in the final order of things are entirely cosmetic (and I do understand that some can't) you might just actually enjoy it."
"Another good star wars movie! Being a 1 year old when this movie came out, i had no baggage of the original trilogy when watching this movie, in fact i have no memories of seeing star wars for the first time, its just something i've always known about, but as far as i remember, this was the first Star Wars movie i ever saw (Probably around 4 years old when i first saw it). It entertained me then, and it still entertains me now. The light saber action is quick, innovative for the franchise, i loved the pod racing sequence, Jar Jar i found funny and Darth Maul was an awesome villain who, even though he lacks as an intellectual presence, makes up for it with his physical presence . Its also as if George knew that the senate scenes could lose the child audience, so in order to keep them, he tried to make what should be boring, as visually stimulating as possible. With all of the floating chairs and large variety of Aliens this kept me engaged. 

Revisiting this movie as an adult, not much has changed, Jar Jar is generally annoying but two gags still made me chuckle. As an adult now i fully understand all of the politics as well, which i didn't as a child. Chancellor Palpatine takes advantage of an already corrupt republic to put himself in a win win position. Under his Emperor guise he manipulates the greedy trade federation to invade in order to create a crisis. By getting the queen to sign his treaty making the invasion legal, the people of Naboo would still suffer and then the senate would no longer legally be able to intervene. So because of the ""Endless debating"" in the senate, he could have shown how the republic is ineffective and talks for too long rather than acts. He could then have moved for a vote of no confidence to secure his power under the promise of a strong republic that acts when others suffer. With the queen escaping, and coming to Coruscant and seeing how ineffective the republic is herself, Palpatine still got the same result. Very intricate and complex, and it goes further than this, but watching Palpatines subtle manipulations will always be a treat. It should also be noted, that if the trade federation was successful, then they could have controlled shipping to and from Naboo and therefore avoided taxation with this particular planet (so here is their motivations). 

But anyway, its nice that as an adult rewatching this there is still more layers to uncover. Obi-Wan, Padme, and Jar Jar each get complete arcs here, with a slice of Anakins overall arc shown via his leaving his mother and slavery behind and the Jedi treating him coldly, rigidly sticking to dogma rather than making some allowances to help Anakin who was already older than the usual students. Yoda is not yet the Yoda we know, while wise, he, like the rest of the Jedi around him, is quite arrogant, so he too learns things across this trilogy that forms him into the person we see in empire. Qui-Gon is the standout character though. Qui-Gon is a maverick, very much in tune with serving the will of the force, and being open minded. His peers assume they know everything about the force and have become more tied up in politics, and rely more on their technology to try and determine whether Anakin is the chosen one. Qui-Gon is more spiritual and reasonable, and often defies the council and the jedi code. He would have been a perfect master for Anakin, and had he not died, events in the saga would have unfolded very differently. Theres a reason the final fight is called ""The Duel of the Fates"".  There are two great articles on the character http://www.starwars.com/news/5-reasons-qui-gon-jinn-is-maybe-the-best-jedi ,  http://www.starwars.com/news/my-favorite-scene-qui-gon-waits

But that's enough of him. The practical effects in the movie looked great, but by 2018 standards, the gungans and battle droid CGI is looking a little dated, but the gungans at least can display emotion better than puppets. The acting at times can be a little wooden or monotone, but there could be reasonable in universe explanations for this. The Jedi by their upbringing are a little more disconnected from their emotions, more stoic, and Padme in her Queen guise uses a different voice that i'm assuming makes it easier for her decoys to emulate and therefore pose as her. The soundtrack is fantastic and audio editing spot on. The fight choreography is intense, it has an insane amount of great world-building, there is a lot to love here. For those complaining about Jar Jar, him and his antics cover only 10 minutes of the movie, and the trade talk and politics cover 12 minutes of the movie. Thats 22 minutes in a 136 minute movie. Thats 16% of a movie. Personally these don't bother me in the slightest, Jar Jar is entertaining for the kids, and you only have to go into your local pub to see that one of the most common topic is politics. And how could it not be political? Of the few prequel references in the original trilogy, we hear about the Clone Wars, the fall of Anakin, the Birth of the twins and A New Hope, tells us that the imperial senate was just dissolved, so this political direction was to be expected. This film strikes a good balance, there is plenty of stuff for the kids who are newcomers to the franchise to love and also Adults who have now grown up and need something more intricate to think about. This is actually my father's favorite film in the franchise. Its not perfect, but worth a watch."
"John Williams score is the best of the trilogy, and the world building and lightsaber duels are cool. Poor cgi and of course, Jar Jar Binks, greatly affected the quality of this movie."
"Star Wars the phantom menace was the 1st installment of the prequels. Technically speaking it is the worst, but in some ways I enjoyed it more than the other two movies. For one it doesn’t have any really intense or gory scenes, which I like. Yes, Darth maul gets chopped in half, and yes Qui-Gon gets stabbed, but it doesn’t bother me that much intensity wise. Jar Jar is also not that annoying."
The Last Jedi is better
Not the best movie (definitely not the best star wars movie ever) because it has way too much CG and not much variety in characters and has the worst character of all time (in star wars) jar jar binks.
"Undeniably the worst Star Wars movie to date. It will be hard to make a movie this stiff, unfunny, cringe-inducing, uninteresting, bland movie that seems to be more compelled to create a Jedi C-Span with one good fight scene than to create a compelling Star Wars action movie. Ditch the politics and give me more Duel of Fates and this movie would be good."
"You know what they say, everyone needs somewhere to sh#t,  I guess this is where George Lucas went.  Literally one of the worst films ever made other than the other two Star Wars prequels movies.  When you have to generate 2 different tv series to help unf#*@ the mess that is the prequels, you know you messed up."
"Anyone can critique the prequel films for hours nonstop and make a lot of logical points. At the end of the day though, all of the prequels are still better than The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. The prequels had some of the best lightsaber duels and fight choreography in the series, the films didn't ruin already established characters (Han Solo, General Leia, Admiral Akbar, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, etc.), the films featured a lot of different characters the fans cared about so much, fantastic soundtrack, original plots, a lot of world-building showcasing the lore of the Star Wars universe, no Mary Sues or Gary Stus, and no SJW propaganda in sight. Sure characters such as Obi-Wan and Anakin had plot armor at times, but both lost in a duel against Count Dooku in Episode II. The dumbest scene in The Phantom Menace was little Anakin blowing up the battle droid control ship. He's a good pod-racer, but it's a bit stupid to see a kid that young accomplish what the adult, experienced pilots failed to do in the Naboo space battle. All in all, the pod-race scene, the Battle of Naboo between the gungans and battle droids, and the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon Jinn at the end of the film made it worth watching. The last half hour was great despite the idiotic scenes with Anakin. Perhaps, the film would have been better with less Jar Jar and an older Anakin."
"aside from the boring politics and that annoying gungan, star wars episode i is a blast."
THIS MOVIE SUCKED  SO BAD I MEAN WHAT THE HECK WERE THEY THINKING PUTTING THAT STUPID ANNOYING JAR JAR IN THIS MOVIE ALSO THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FIGHTING AND WHEN WE FINALLY GOT SOME ACTION IT SUCKED AND THEY BARLEY GAVE DARTH  MAUL ANY SCREEN TIME THE COOLEST THING IN THE MOVIE ONLY HAD 1 OR  2 LINES AND GOT VERY LITTLE SCREEN TIME! but that lightsaber duel at the end was awesome and the pod race was pretty good to but the bad scenes out way the good scenes by a landslide. I JUST REALLY HATED THIS MOVIE!
"The Phantom Menace is a very disappointing Star Wars film...yet is somehow overhated. If you enjoy Star Wars you might have an ok time with it, but my recommendation would be to go on youtube and watch ""The Pod Race Scene"" As the film editing mixed with the visual effects in that scene alone makes this movie at least enjoyable at best.
 I'll give it 
         - 45%"
"This movie seems like it is hardly ever re-watchable and is one that I wouldn't mind skipping on my seemingly almost monthly Star Wars marathons. From poor dialogue, to a cast without chemistry, to bad CGI and animation, this movie is all over the place. The dialogue in this movie, and famously with the Star Wars Prequels, are just cheesy and literally out of this world. From Anakin to Yoda, everyone gets their fair share of the George Lucas cheese dialogue spectacular. This cast on paper rocks and block buster, including Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, and Keira Knightly. However, this star-studded cast, lacks a special dose of what many call, chemistry. The stale dialogue creates the acting to be stale and the movie suffers from the acting being poor. Lastly, the CGI and animation are just horrendous. The amount of time and care put into this was probably non-existent, or the movie ran out of budget to make it seem a little realistic. Overall, this movie is just a bore and is an easy movie to skip and pick up with Episode 2 in the marathons."

"5 Year old me loved it, but I started to realize it's flaws as I got older. Then TFA and TLJ came out and made me realize how good I had it. At least the prequels add depth to the originals and Episode III was legitimately a really good movie. 

Cons:
- Slate dialogue. (2nd movie suffers from this too)
- Jar Jar. It seems like they added him for kids, but he really does kind of suck.
- Senate negotiations. Could've been better with better dialogue but just kind of boring

Pros:
- Cool action scenes (Pod race, Maul battle, others)
- Get to see beginnings of a lot of characters
- Has a plot/characters you can get into if you can get past the stale dialouge
- It's not TLJ"
"The dialogue isn't as crisp as one would like to expect, and the middle act on tatooine was long and convoluted, however, it was a visual spectacle, and was able to develop characters that I cared about until the end. Burdened by my high expectations, it was still a disappointment, but a worthy installment in the star wars saga."
"The so-called 'phantom edits' of this film prove the frustrating truth - it had so much potential, came close, and greatly disappointed. It had enough redeeming qualities to remain a 'decent' if patchy film, but it could have been so much more. George Lucas may be a great ideas man, but this film and it's successor really exposed the gaps in his skill-set. Frustrating but compelling viewing."
"I am re-watching all of the Star Wars movies to cleanse my palette from the most recent one.

As much as this one in particular is panned, it had a well put together script, and the story was worth telling. The production values are easily on par with any modern movie, though the cinematography and storytelling is less bombastic that modern audiences are used to. The visuals and sound are fantastic as well, and really give you a good variety of settings to look at when the Republic was at it's height.

The only real problems with this movie stem from two factors. The first is the use of a child actor for the part of Anakin. If he was aged up a bit into his early teens, I think the performance would have been more natural, less creepy when played against Natalie Portman, and more believable as a whole with other minor tweaks. The other problem was Jar Jar, because of the slapstick physical comedy. If they had toned him down instead of amping him to 11 for the kids, I don't think people would have been particularly bothered.

It's still a very coherent story that sits firmly grounded in the universe enjoyed by many fans."
"At first, this film may seem like a disappointment in the 'Star Wars' saga however watching it as a lone film puts it in a whole new perspective. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace may rely on big budget CGI action sequences but it certainly does it well. I give this film 72%."
"Still better than the force awakens, and the last jedi...even with meesa in it........"
Don't be put off by the bad reputation. Beautifully shot with great action sequences. The light saber duel at the end is probably the best in the entire series. Darth Maul is an excellent villain. Highly recommend!
"While there are elements of this film that work, it ultimately feels unneccessary. I found myself zoning out through large swaths of this movie and ultimately didn't miss anything important to the overarching plot of the series. Jar Jar Binks, while meme-worthy, is a drain on this film, and the central conflict of the film is not terribly engaging or memorable. I send Jake Lloyd my condolences."
"I am giving this 5 stars because I think there is a lot of overly harsh criticism of this film.  In reality, I would give it 3.5 to 4 stars.  I think you have to keep in perspective that this was more or less a film made for younger kids.  Yes, there were some points that were a bit lacking, such as Jar Jar Binks, the fact Anakin was a bit of a Mary Sue (but to be honest, he was more lucky than good).  It was a good start to the saga oveall, you meet the main characters, had good special affects (for it's time), and a classic musical score.  Overall, worth a watch."
I confess I actually enjoyed the prequels. There are some things I wish were different but overall I like them. After seeing The Last Jedi I have an even greater appreciation for them. I saw this one on opening day with my brother and was not disappointed. There are some things that some may find tedious such as trade negotiations and some light politics (not like watching C-SPAN) but those are important in understanding how the clone wars started and the Republic was thrown into such disarray. It is overall very enjoyable with lightsabre duels that are better than anything in the OT. Character dialog could have been better as with all Star Wars movies but overall the points are made and the film is a fun watch.
"I like this movie it was good but definitely not the best the second worst after The Clone Wars which was good but boring this movie offers us totally different characters such as Qui Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala and shows us who Obi Won was before the trilogy and adds up in the character young Anakin was well played by Jake Lloyd and Jar Jar Binks was terrible in this movie he was stupidly funny and dumb and this movie showed how things were before the empire I enjoyed it way more than The Clone Wars Darth Maul was awesome in this movie no exceptions. Overall It was a great movie but could have been better."

Really love this movie! Really!
Let's face it...not The best of the films...but it's still entertaining fodder.  Fun and entertaining at times.  That's about it.
It's Star Wars So I'm Giving It Five Stars!!
Only two redeeming factors for this movie. The Pod Race and Darth Maul. Too bad they killed there coolest character and sent him off like a little baby. Apart from that this movie is absolutely boring. The lightsaber battles don't give you time to breathe and that isn't good because you don't feel any intensity. Overall this film is a huge disappointment. I liked it when I was 6 but I'm older now and I like to be my usual nit-picky self
Underrated film. This should be viewed with greater appreciation now that Star Wars is in the hands of those who don't know what to do with it.
"A great way to restart the series and introduce some of the politics and intrigue that got Palpatine in a position to be Emperor by the end of the Prequels. The pod race was way too long though. Heck, I even liked the Midichlorines."
"An experimental epic space fantasy adventure with mystic knights, dark sorcerers, a young queen, laser gun fights, the magical force, the galaxy before the centralized Empire, and loads and loads of cgi."
A very nice film for children and adults too.
"In retrospect, this film is so SUPERIOR to Last Jedi/Rogue One and all the appalling Disney trash in every way. 
Come back George, all is forgiven!"
"As a kid, the pod-race was the most thrilling thing I'd ever seen in a cinema and the fight with Darth Maul still thrills me!"
The film that started it all!
This movie don't get enough luv!
"Even with Ja Ja Binks, far better than the abomination of The Last Jedi..."
"Great movie overall, one annoying CGI character but loved the story over all. This one opens up many curiosities from the original trilogy and answers them. Great visuals with duals and origin of Jedi heroes. Setups up the next movie perfectly and has beautiful scenes throughout."
"This movie gets a lot of hate, but when you take the time to step back and think about the Star Wars universe as a whole, this film is actually quite memorizing.

It beautifully introduces the Star Wars galaxy many years before the rebellion against the Sith, to a time when the Senate and the Jedi ruled the universe.  We meet incredible Jedi like Mace Windu and Yoda, and discover the reemergence of the Sith.

No, this film is not perfect by any means.  It came out in a time when CGI was still somewhat clunky, but if you can find a way to look past that, you'll realize how much this film brought life to the Star Wars series.  It introduced a whole new aspect of the universe that the originally trilogy could not do alone.  You can see the level of passion that went into making it.  Unlike episodes 7 and 8.

If you don't like this movie, watch it again with a more neutral stance.  Enjoy it for what it is and I assure you it will change your mind."
"This movie fails in so many ways. Overuse of CGI, terrible scripting that wastes several great actors, the stupidity of everything Jar Jar Binks does, and way too many minutes spent talking about poorly-constructed space politics results in this movie falling flat on its face."
"It's terrible but also pointless. If you really want to see prequels, skip it and start from the episode II"
"The film that changes the myth of the Jedi to the legend of the Jedi.  Also the film that taught there's a degree of separation between expectation and actualization.  It was supposed to be a film about the rise of Darth Vader, but first we had to establish the good in him.  And Qui-Gon v. Darth Maul; the Noble Warrior against the Killer.  It also  has Natalie Portman's best performance in the prequels."
"This is my least favorite Star Wars movies so far. The Phantom Menace definitely is disappointing considering the originals but it is still one of my favorite movies ever. Even though it is disappointing there are still thing that I find that I loved about this movie like the racing scene, Natalie Portman's portrayal of Padme Amidala, and the how we get to see what Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader was like when he was a child. The visual effects and animatronics are gorgeous and dazzling especially R2-D2. The makeup and costumes were done extremely well. The acting from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Daniels was great. The voice over performance from Frank Oz was also great. The musical score was fantastic."

"George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire."
"This film is underrated! Sure, I could produce better CGI creatures with a potato; but the podracing is really good fun and Jake Lloyd's Anakin is actually pretty well acted. Obviously we're all bothered by the gungans, the endless senate meetings, and the weird jedi robot voices that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor seemed to consider necessary. But I think Qui Gon is a great character, Queen Amadala is perfect and Darth Maul is a worthy villain. This movie suffered massively due to expectations and is by no means a masterpiece but it is perfectly watchable and entertaining."
Hard to believe this was the work of the great George Lucas. I’m sure he finds that hard to believe too.
This movie was really good.
"Despite what everyone says THIS is a Star Wars movie. Yes it has lots of flaws. But I still like this movie.

I was a kid when this came out, I was 9 when i first saw it on VHS, in 2000 This became my all time favourite movie, i grew up on Star Wars, i lived for Star Wars.

This movie gave us great characters, such as Qui Son Ginn, and introduces us to the  second greatest villain of all time Darth Maul, and produces, in my opinion, the second greatest lightsaber duel (No.1 you'll have to read through my other reviews to find out, which).

For me, I came to dislike this movie instead of enjoying the moment and not overthink it, was when I started reading everyone else reviews/opinions.

Overall review of the story (As a 9year old) 
Awesome, funny, great fight scene way better than anything in the old trilogy.
Overall review (now):
I still watch it, i just fast forward all the political crap, skip Qui Got Chatting with Ani's mother and mainly watch it for the duel of the fates, for a terrific musical score. the Story is scattered, no focus on a single main character, too much talking not enough doing. and Honest Opinion on Jar Jar, i grew up laughing at him so to me he was and still isn't that bad, he's better than Rose in Episode 8. Her character is utterly cringeworthy.

My Edits:
1. Less talking, ""faster more, intense"" 
2.  Jar Jar, i think he was originally going to be Darth Plagueis. or some form of Dark Jedi, acting stupid, but he's the reason Darth Maul finds Anakin on Tatooine.
3. Focus on A main character, Instead of not really knowing who the main character is, The story should have been told through Obi Wan's perspective, giving us build up into Anakin.
4. Anakin Should have been older, a 9 to 14 year old age gap is a bit creepy.
5. In Episode 6, Obi Wan speaking to Luke ""when i first knew him, your father was already a great pilot..""
Episode 1, He had never won a race, not even finished. I think he needed to be a little better than that.
6. Don't kill off Darth Maul, only to bring him back in the clone wars tv show only.. 

From one fan to another, watch the prequels like your 9-10 year old self and enjoy it, don't over think it, don't do anything but watch. 
As a very influential being once said ""Do or do not, there is no try""

IF you want to judge the prequels, maybe should also look at judging the original trilogy in the same amount of detail. Episode 4 is about a whiny kid. Episode 5 ""nothing happens"" - George Lucas, Episode 6 the empire is defeated by Ewoks."
"This movie gets far morenhate than it deserves. Grantedbits nowhere near the level of the original trilogy, it still makes for a fun time. And let's be honest, is Jar Jar Binks really any worse than the Ewoks?"
people hate it only because Darth maul died but at least he died a great way
"I see the points people dislike it, I see why JarJar is hated, but after the last jedi, people should rewatch. It isn't that bad.
I watched it multiple times, but I won't watch The Last Jedi ever again."
"A solid Star Wars film with one fatal flaw, and other, more minor, inconveniences. You all know what I am talking about - Jar Jar is the dead weight tipping the scales from good to not-so-good movie."
"Probably the weakest film in the franchise. It's between this and return of the Jedi for weakest entry.
However the film is still quite enjoyable and well made. The mythology is rich and the viewer is rewarded with the best lightsaber battle in the franchise."
"This movie has its ups and downs. I frankly enjoy the first thirty minutes and the last thirty minutes of the movie the most, but in between it's alright. The movie starts off in a fun way in my opinion, seeing the jedi at a time when the order was still around and very prevalent in the galaxy was amazing and Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson do a fantastic job. The action is fun and fast, and John Williams score is brilliant. Of course, Jar Jar is a major downside of the movie. Not only is his dialogue and voice just awful but the CGI is extremely outdated. However, my least favorite part of this movie is Anakin and the Tatooine sequence. Contrary to most people, I do not care for the podrace at all because it's so long and really boring after the first two minutes. Jake Lloyd did a good job, for his age, but that doesn't mean I have to like his character. Darth Maul and the ""Phantom Menace"" that we later learn is Palpatine needed a much more involved role in the movie, but when they were on screen I absolutely loved it. As I said earlier, the last thirty minutes I really liked. It was action packed, amazingly scored, and just a blast to watch although it was occasionally cheesy. Overall I'd give it a 3/5 because of fun action scenes, amazing music, overall good acting, and amazing locations but also outdated CGI, extremely boring scenes, villains that did not get enough screentime, and overall shitty humor and characters that are aimed towards toddlers."
"I definitely liked this movie, not my favorite of the saga though.  I loved the complex storytelling, and the story is especially engaging to me because I am fairly invested into the lore of the Star Wars universe.  John Williams' soundtrack is undoubtedly amazing.  The new locations (Naboo, Coruscant, etc) are also simply beautiful.  Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are acted perfectly, and their fight scene with Darth Maul was outstanding.  I also didn't really mind the politics aspect too much, I thought it was cool to see Palpatine's seemingly inconspicuous beginnings.  That being said, I could understand why a lot of people wouldn't like this movie.  There were parts of it that seemed to just drag on - most of what happened on Tatooine was just lame, young Anakin was just kinda strange, and the senate/jedi council shit is just too complex and boring for most people.  The podracing scene might have been kinda fun to watch but it felt like a useless time waster to me.  Darth Maul was a badass but still somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized.  Most of the CGI characters (ESPECIALLY JAR-JAR) were also just fucking abysmal.  Jar-Jar just did not work at all.  Speaking of the CGI, it might have been good for the time but it has definitely not aged well.  Overall it's an undoubtedly flawed but still enjoyable film."
"I always liked elements of this film: the Music, especially Duel of Fates... Darth Maul... Qui-Gon Jinn... the pod racers themselves (though not the chase)... the whole look and design of Theeds and Naboo...  the three-way lightsaber duel.

But it was seeing Last Jedi that truly raised this film in my estimation!
Now it seem like a work of sheer genius in comparison!"
"I'm with Paul C, and a lot of other people on this; The Last Jedi was disgraceful, so I decided to revisit The Phantom Menace, which I didn't really like much when it was released. However, after watching TPM tonight, the storytelling is so much better than The 'awful' Last Jedi. TPM has decent story telling, with some good ideas-a great cast, which can be under used at times. The saber battle scenes are great, as are the space scenes. The problems lay with using the Jar Jar character for comedy value-it's still annoying. The other problem is that there's the over reliance of CGI; The balance between costume, make-up, location sets, studio sets, against CGI, is all wrong. CGI should be used as an enhancement, and not complete substance, and that's where the movie partly fails; it just doesn't feel organic. And, Lucas isn't the best with dialogue, here. Aside from these glaring flaws, and a few more not mentioned, it's a reasonably enjoying movie."
Not as good as the original trilogy but i loved it
I've never been able to sit through this movie. I don't know what its about and I really don't care. Lucas really failed here.
"Watching the contemptible monstrosity that is ""Last Jedi"" made me appreciate ""The Phantom Menace"". 
My fondness for this film has grown with time, where as my contempt for ""Last Jedi"" has already doubled in the month since its release. 

The lightsaber battle with Dark Maul is still the best choreography in any of the films. 
Liam Neeson's Qui Gon Jinn is a wonderful Jedi Knight.
Ewan does a good job of Obi Wan.
And yes, I DO love the pod race!"
This is my fifth favorite Star Wars move and better than any Disney movie so far.
better than the last jedi gets a 6.4/10
Way better than the Last Jedi. It had amazing moments and actually had a plot.
"I hope this doesn't make me a bad person, but am I the only one who sees racial stereotypes playing out in many of the characters, and E.T. in the senate?  Easily defeated, crappy plot lines, that condone the existance of slavery by ""the good"" side of the ""force"".. Hey, this kid is all emotional, might turn into a bad guy.. of course, we left his mother to suffer, but it's his fault he's traumatized and resorts to genocide when he himself has the power to do so, too late.. Story isn't terrible, just flimsy."
"*sob* Why, George? What were you thinking? Midichlorians?! Politics?! JAR JAR BINKS?! NO! These do not belong in a Star Wars movie! The only good things about this movie are Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Darth Maul. Just avoid this movie."
"I cannot in good faith put more than 3 stars, but wanted to add enough stars for RT to count it as ""fresh' from this review.  Having seen The Last Jedi, I can say in the Star Wars universe we definitely have a new low.  Rian Johnson has done something truly incredible, without any involvement whatsoever he has made the prequels better.  What a travesty TLJ turned out to be."
"Going against the grain but I loved EP1 , granted was weak in a few places but was essentially true Star Wars , the j.williams score was amazing and the now iconic duel with Darth Maul for me is the best full stop ."
Better than the last Jedi
Too much CGI. Too much politics. Too much Jar Jar. WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER
Childish... Very Weak argument...
Those people who do not like that film have difficulties with intelligent and complex story telling. This movie has so much depth and fantastic interpretation of Star Wars. It definitively adds to the Star Wars universe and does not harm it like the new films from Disney.
"Underrated and one of the best prequels 
This is another movie that give us so much more then meets the eye. One of the best light saber duels ever.
Liam neilson as qui-gon is amazing. There is soo many good one liners in this movie. The pod race is awesome . A lot went into making this movie. I highly recommend watching the making of this movie on the LucasFilms you tube channel. 
A very underrated movie that deserves more love for all the heart that was put into this film."
Better than The Last Jedi.
"Brilliant, compared with the new ones anyway."
"Just finished watching star wars Phantom Menace again after all these years, And i really enjoyed it. George Lucas know how to tell a story that is meaningful and make sense. Phantom menace got a lot of bad press when it was released back in 1999 and i my self was disappointed at that time as well. however going back after all these years i really appreciated the plot and the story of this film. although i don't think this film is perfect,the empire strikes back is still my favorite film in the series. I came back to this film after the disastrous last Jedi  by  Rian Johnson's. Because i remember not being very fond phantom menace at the time of its release now going back i find my self appreciating George Lucas plot and story telling some great characters (except Jar Jar of course) his sense of magic and wonder that exists in this film it was still star wars. Disney thought they could do Better than George in making a star wars film, Well this time they failed and failed miserably (the Last Jedi). I felt JJ Abrams at least understood what star wars was all about and truly cared for the the films and loved the universe and characters that they belong in and there was an actual story in the film force awakens the film like a love letter to fans every where.  As for Rian Johnson's  well We know how the fans feel about this One Im sorry there is no excuse for the brutal plot and story in your film, this was not a high school English  writing class project this was a high budget feature film, and yes people can tell the difference believe it or not. (Game of thrones is not popular because of all the great CGI in the show the fantastic story telling may just have a little something to do with it.) May the Force be with you R.I.P.  

What i would love to see is George Lucas And JJ Abrams (force awakens) do the next film  and breath some life back into the franchise and Now that would be Something."
"The prequels are a terrific return to the Star Wars universe. People do not appreciate the task of creating the entire universe in which the original Star Wars story takes place. In TPM, the extended stay in Tatooine, the discovery of Anakin, and the beginnings of the positioning of the pieces that brought about the empire and the return of the Sith rule, are masterful positioned. The people who so harshly criticize the actor who played Anakin are complete ingrates."
"Loved the film, hated the Jar Jar And pod racing portions. The political strife felt interesting and didn't bore me. Loved whenever Qui-Gon And Obi-Wan were on screen. Overall it was an above average film. It kept me intrigue and interested in what was happening next. That final fight with Maul was also super cool."
Admitadley one of the weaker entry's into the first six films.  It can get a little boring in the middle but in my opinion the duel of fates at the end is well worth the wait.
This movie deserves a better wrap than it gets. Especially considering how disappointing I find the newest ones. Looking back Qui Gon jinn was the coolest Jedi in any of the 8 movies so far minus Yoda. A lot of the art was beautiful on Naboo as well. Also all the adults critics saying 'it won't appeal to kids' don't have a clue what they are saying. I saw this actually when I was like 10 and I though it was fantastic. I watched all the time on video too. Kids loving seeing their fantasy world flesh out as much as anyone and don't need only action and light sabers Christ.
"Most of this movie is pretty boaring and it is a little silly. The story was not really interesting, however it had some incredible action scenes especially towards the end of the film. It also has some impressive visual effects. It's ok at best."
better than the last jedi
"I think the film perfectly sets up for the rest of the saga, an average boy selected by higher powers for a greater destiny... however that's what it's about-- the average boy. There are characters that are bad (ahem- Jar Jar) and everyone complains about the dialogue, however it IS a. space opera, the dialogue is supposed to be like that. Overall, great special effects, great battles, and and interesting political ascpect."
better than the new disney stuff
"I was angry about the original trilogy ""special edition"" when the prequel trilogy was released, and I didn't gave these a fair chance at the time. In contrast now to Kennedyfilm's fake sequels, George Lucas's prequels shine. Love Qui-Gon especially in this episode."
"It's not as bad as they say, a family film with too much goofy humor. The kid is annoying as they are, most interesting characters are killed witch is kind of shame ,but it also kinda makes it the best prequel."
"When I first watched this movie when it came out, I think a lot of it went over my head, all the politics aspect of it. However, now that I'm older, especially this past year, I've gone and watched all the prequel movies and find them entertaining. I get them now, and they (episode 1-6) all fit into a whole, complete awesome. I wish Episode 1 had made Anakin a little older, maybe pre-teen, cut down the podracing a little, add more Darth Maul and light saber duels. Less Jar Jar - or at least change his voice up so it's not so annoying, then he'd probably be a little more tolerable. I do like that Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan constantly rag on Jar Jar though. I like Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, Padme........little Anakin was good too, but i just wish they had made him a little older, maybe make both him and padme the same age (14)."
Lo único bueno de la película es la pelea contra Darth Maul
It's an ok movie but dragged on for too long. It gives a good indication of Anakin SKYWALKER who is very similar to Rey in the new Star Wars movies. Both working for scavengers. I feel there's something in this theory but still hasn't come out.
"Too much politics, not enough good star wars action. Episode 2 manages this balance better. Also Jar Jar Binks."
"It started well, fell in a heap and then tried picking itself up in the final act, but all too late. Maul is terribly underused and then there's the Jar Jar factor... the character would have been better in (much) smaller doses.  The pod racing scene went a bit too long, and some of the clunkers that were dropped (Midichlorians?) detract from a movie I'm sure every SW fan wanted to like."
"Not a great movie. But I think the hatred for this film is a little overdone. It was my least favorite Star Wars film until I saw The Last Jedi, but at least it feels like a Star Wars film."
"Underrated Star Wars movie. Star Wars has always been about the visuals and a rollicking style adventure and not some in-depth character analysis. Its a roller coaster not a mystery. box and in that vein this movie is excellent. The design was also stunning and while it suffers from what all Star Wars movies suffer (dialogue, ham acting, etc) it was a great addition to the Star Wars Universe."
I knew this movie sucked within minutes.  What a disappointment.
So much better than the Last Jedi. The Last Jedi has given me new found appreciation and love for this movie. I love this movie now. It is light years better than the Last Jedi which sucks @$$!!!
TLJ makes the prequels looks like masterpieces in comparison.
The least intolerable of the prequels and much more entertaining than The Last Jedi.
Classic. Simply the Best.
"Good enough movie for a prequel which is supposed to tie in a backstory to the original trilogy. The plot makes sense, is consistent with the rest of the movies, and develops the characters backstories well. I very much enjoyed the building up the political situation, plus it was complex and realistic enough to be immersive and believable.  The move introduces many different worlds, technologies, and creatures beyond the trilogy, wonderful creativity and freshness. Fantastic battles and light saber fights. The pod race was fun.  On the negative side, I think Jar Jar got too much screen time and was more annoying than necessary. Although I didn't hate him as much as some others do. He was mildly amusing. The explanation for Midichlorians was unnecessary and unbelievable. They could have cut that whole detailed explanation out and just called midichlorians some genetic receptivity to the force. Excellent development of the Jedi council dynamics, and relationship to the Republic. Many more excellent things well done George!"
"Colourful, beautiful, but overly padded."
"Great movie for reboot the best saga in history. Liam Neeson was perfect as the teacher of Obi-wan Kenobi. Casting was great, Ewan McGregor was the perfect choice for a young Obi-wan Kenobi.
My only gripe, they killed one of the best villains in cinematic history, Darth Maul"
"Maybe it's always been there, but I'm repeatedly struck by the stereotyping of dialects in this episode. Jarring; distracting.

That said, I thought it was a nice return of the franchise for the prequels. And, given that I've always thought of Star Wars as first and foremost a children's / family saga, I actually liked the Jar-Jar character."
The most underrated film of all time.
"I loved it when I was 10 years old, hated it when I was 20 and now I think its watchable. The CGI looks very dated now. Soundtrack is still fantastic. The Finale is worth watching the rest of the movie. Even with midichlorians, plot holes and too much space taxes and politics, it still stays mostly true to Star Wars, something you can not say about Episode 8.

5>4>6>>7>R1>3>1>2>>>8"
my favorite of the 3 but absolutely terrible
My apologies to George Lucas.  His prequels tower above Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi
My favorite star wars film hands down
Deep story a world of suffering is hindered by a slow moving Senate which does nothing as two white knights are dispatched to save the day. The action is great the characters memorable and the score amazing I love this movie.
Only reason I give this 2.5 stars is because the Maul vs Obi Wan/Jinn ending was awesome! This movie is only better than Attache of the Clones and The Last Jedi.
"Terrible, should be removed from canon"
Except from the ending really boring and bad. Unfortunately.
"An Episode not worth watching, I gave it 3 chances but I doubt I will rack up 100 plus watches the way I did NH & ESB"
"I am in the minority of liking prequels. I don't think Jar Jar is as bad as everyone else seems to think. Take out a few scenes or change what he says and it is fine. There are a couple scenes with Anakin which could have been better, but all in all I really like the movie."
"The second worst star wars. I don't know what they were thinking, but Maul was still cool, and I liked Obi Wan and Qui Gon. Anakin, Jar Jar, Midichlorians, and a bunch of other things are crap."
Didn't like it at 13 hate it at 32
M I D I C H L O R I A N S
"I have always thought this was a good beginning. Jake Lloyd was good enough. Certainly way better than the kids they had play young Tom Riddle in Half Blood Prince. I guess it's hard to pick the kid that's going to grow up to be a villain. Soundtrack is very good, visual very good, the story is good, not great. Not a big fan of the midichlorians but I get that Lucas was trying to find some way to quantify how strong a being is with the force. It also makes sense that what was considered ""magic"" in the original trilogy due to the rise of them Sith Galactic Empire and destruction of the Jedi; now has more ""science"" behind it.
Qui Gon Jinn is number 3 on my all-time favorite list behind Vader and Luke now. 
Ewan McGregor does a great job, Obi Wan just is not my favorite character.
?Ian McDiarmid is great as Senator Palpatine.
Ray Park's Darth Maul is awesome though a little one dimensional. I think he should have been kept around longer.
Natalie Portman is very good as Padme Amidala. Not crazy about the idiotic system of government but I guess there are all kinds in the Galaxy.
I dislike Watto but he's more unpleasant than evil which I think is good. Anakin is not free but he's clearly not abused either. No one wants to see that. I guess it could be argued that if you don't want to portray the characters situation as horrible as it could be instead of this clean, sanitized version, then maybe you should could up with other circumstances for them.
It was nice to see Jabba in his prime.
I loved the Jedi Council but the first attempt at Yoda was awful! The changes they have made over the years have improved him.
Sam Jackson as Mace Windu is fantastic.
I don't care for the Gungans who are the new Ewoks but whatever. George Lucas has to have his whimsical characters so it's really the just the price of doing business with him. They are easily ignored.
Anyway, I thought it was a pretty good start."
a under appreciated yet clever movie
"Many mistakes, but better than people say/remember."
"The Phantom Menace is a divisive film, to say the least. Fan expectations were extremely high in 1999 when the film was released. However, I'd say that it's by no means as bad as people think.

The Phantom Menace, the fourth Star Wars film but the first chronologically, follows Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi as they help Queen Amidala save her planet of Naboo from invasion. Along their adventure, they meet Anakin Skywalker, who Qui-Gon believes to be the prophesied Chosen One that will bring balance to the Force. While the film seems inconsequential at first glance, it proves to be a worthwhile addition to the saga.

There are a few awkward lines here and there, but I find that the movie's plot, soundtrack, action, and effects more than make up for it. Qui-Gon, who we follow for most of the movie, is a rogue and idealistic Jedi. About midway through the movie, we get to see the other members of the Jedi Order and it's interesting to see how Qui-Gon clashes with their beliefs. Jar Jar Binks' (the controversial comic relief in the film) presence in the movie has definitely been exaggerated over the years. He by no means ruins the movie and even serves the story well by helping to set up the ending battle sequence. And I'm sure that most of you know already that the famous lightsaber battle at the end of the movie is well worth seeing. The film also benefits from the chemistry between Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson), Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August), and Anakin (Jake Lloyd).

I think that Star Wars fans today would really benefit from giving the prequels another go. They really aren't as bad as most people think. The Phantom Menace provides an engaging and interesting plot combined with some of the best action in the saga."
"Even with its flaws it feels like a star wars movie unlike the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi)."
"With such an ambitious plot, it's easy to understand why forty-somethings wishing to recapture their childhood got so mad. This is a story for a new generation and a political and social commentary for the new millenium, while keeping that epic fairytale sensitivity to it."
"I don't care too much for the looseness of the plot and how it unfolds.  That said, there are moments of greatness (e.g., the podrace scene, Darth Maul, etc.) that tug on your heartstrings like those old Hollywood epics...Also, say what you will about this movie, it IS original.  The sequel trilogy (i.e., Force Awakens) is not, and The Last Jedi takes WAY too many liberties with basic conceptual understandings of the force, jedi/sith, etc. (also Luke's character was mishandled horribly in The Last Jedi).  I'm giving this 5 stars because of my contempt for Star Wars marketed to the uninformed, millennial/Gen Z social media crowd."
I love the prequels and no review can tell me otherwise
"Phantom Menace looking pretty good right now after watching Last Jedi.. People panned these prequels, but honestly, compared to what Disney is putting out, these movies were gems.."
It's very good movie
everyone hates this one... but I like Qui Gon Jinn and the pod races
"After Watching The Last Jedi, I came back to give this movie 5 stars. Im sorry Jake Lloyd"
"O filme tem seus defeitos, mas as cenas são bem feitas, alem de muito bem coreografas. A cena das podracers é a melhor do filme, assim como a batalha de sabres de luz é boa. Apesar de tudo o enredo é redundante e faz pouco sentido. Alguns personagens são imuteis na trama e o próprio Kenobi poderia nem estar no filme..."
"To be fair, the prequels (episodes 1-3) weren't so bad when compared with the the sequels (7-9). Of course though, nothing beats the Original Trilogy. (4-6)"
This movie now seems much better after seeing the Last Jedi.  The Last Jedi now holds the title of the worst Star Wars movie.
"Say what you will about Jar Jar, the movie is beautiful.  The locales, the characters, the vastness it adds to the Star Wars universe is worth far more to our beloved galaxy far, far away than any one individual character.  I hate that some bad lines and less-than-perfect characters are enough to relegate this wonderful trilogy to the pile as mediocre.  I love this movie, have seen it several times and never once understood why people hold quite so much antagonism toward it."
I’m i the very few that like this Star Wars episode? Darth Maul light saber fighting scene is the best of all the Star Wars episode.
The main Star Wars movie. A pure masterpiece.
"What is interesting about the prequels, which in my opinion fall short of the original, is that is is the brain child of the same director/producer creator, George Lucas.  yet at the same time, they don't measure up to what some fans, including myself, enjoyed about the original saga.  I think that Menace is probably the strongest of the three, I would rank them as 1. menace, 2. Revenge of the sith, 3. attack of the clones.   While there are dazzling scenes, incredible costumes, good choreographed light saber fights, Darth Maul is a great villain, and it was nice to see the Star Wars universe back on the big screen, the phantom menace pointed to a lurking future menace, and it turned out to be the next two films.  There was just too much thrown on to the screen, the jedi are shown having powers that they don't put to use in the rest of the movie, an overly complicated plot, the explanation of the force ""mediclorians"" or whatever they were called, the Jar Jar character that was annoying as heck.  One thing that has to be mentioned however, is the foresight Lucas seems to have had, as democracy dies in the republic and a power hungry selfish politician slowly consolidates power to become a dictator...hmmm who does that sound like?"
"While entertaining at times, this film just wastes its material with stock characters and extended exposition. One word to describe this film: Disappointing."
"Great movie love it but, needed more"
"Very flawed (Jar Jar and some bad acting mostly), but fun. Great lightsaber duels and pod racing scenes. Liam Neeson is great."
amazing start of the prequel of the three
"Awful film from start to finish. Too many things to pick out that i hated...But the main thing that is lost is the look and feel of a Star wars film. This is so wide of the mark it should have been a sequel to the awful Ewok movies!
There are no redeeming qualities about this movie and as time passes it becomes worse and worse."
Thats how you start a brand new trilogy for star wars
"Just rewatched the prequels. They still don't hold a candle to the original trilogy, but at least they tell a story and have character arcs. If you can get past the Gungans, this is an enjoyable film overall."
(Jar Jar Voice) Mesa Hate this movie. It hasa Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar ruin everything. Thin plot and horrific acting greatly hurtsa the movie.
"The Phantom Menace is a highly underrated film. For starters the soundtrack is fantastic. Duel of the Fates is one of the best Star Wars themes. The cast including Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman is fantastic. I loved the Pod Race and arguably the greatest Jedi battle of all time with Darth Maul. I highly recommend the Novelization of Episode 1 for people who would like more story detail."
Not as bad as everyone made it out to be
My favourite Star Wars movie. People trash it but they aren't true fans.
"while it has it's flaws, the phantom menace is a truly fantastic journey."
loved this movie growing up.  brings me back to the glory days of Star Wars.
There is only one reason to watch this movie: Darth Maul.
"I've always had a soft spot for this film. It was the first Star Wars film I ever saw. However, it doesnt change the fact that this film has so many dull moment in it. The only saving grace of this film is the final battle between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. Other than that the film had pointless plot lines and needless characters such as Qui Gon Jin and the hugely annoying Jar Jar Binks. I don't think it's the worse Star Wars film but it takes second place comfortably.

Final Score- 4/10"
Some small flaws but still AMAZING!
"Is this a perfect movie? not a chance. However I do enjoy seeing the Star Wars universe. I love Qui-Gon, young Obi-Wan, and dare I say it? Baby Anakin. For all the movie's faults, it does a good job expanding the Star Wars universe. I saw the movie opening night, and I will never forget the cheering that happened when R2 was introduced. 

The movie isn't perfect, pacing and some characters and off (looking at you Jar Jar). But the story was interesting, the world it created with enthralling and most importantly it felt good to see more of the Star Wars Universe."
"Having just watched The Last Jedi, I've learned to appreciate the prequel movies. They are brilliant in comparison."
I don't hate this movie like most people. It has a lot of issues and everything but I tend to enjoy it.
"Though not without its flaws, the characters are memorable.  The story is compelling and leaves you wanting more.  The lightsaber-duel choreography is some of the best in the franchise."
Meesa Jar Jar - enough said
"Say what you want to say about the prequel trilogy.  However with George Lucas exercising complete creative control over the project its success or failure rested solely with him.  Unlike the company that now produces films based on characters he created.

Set 30+ years before the events of the original trilogy this film sees a young Obi Wan Kenobi and his Jedi mentor Qui-Gon Ginn attempt to mediate a trade dispute between the greedy trade federation and the small planet of Naboo.  However the dispute is a ruse set up by Darth Sidious.  And the Jedi must protect the young Queen Amadala as they attempt to make it to the capital world.

When their hyperdrive is destroyed they find themselves on the desert planet of Tatooine.  While they encounter a young Anakin Skywalker, a slave child with uncanny piloting and mechanical skills.  And Qui-Gon believes that Anakin is especially adept at the force.  The centerpiece of the movie revolves around Anakin entering a dangerous pod race as Qui-Gon Ginn manipulates Anakin's greedy master into wagering his freedom and a new hyperdrive on the race.  

The pod race truly is a spectacle to behold.  Each pod has a distinctive look and feel to it.  Each has a unique driver and pit crew.  This is a throwback to Lucas' love drag racing and cars.  And there is a lot of tension going into the race knowing what's at stake.  In the DVD and Blu Ray editions of the film the race is extended to show all three laps.  The theatrical version only shows about two laps.  It's also an opportunity to show Anakin's piloting skills.  And showing how resourceful he is when in the face of danger.  If only Lucas had transferred Anakin's demeanor in this sequence to the final space battle.  That could have created a more realistic sense of urgency for the young Jedi.

No longer bound by the technology of the 70s and 80s this film gave Lucas the chance to create a universe that was unique and different.  He was able to expand beyond the limited resources he had during the making of the original trilogy.  We got to the Senate at work and the Jedi at their prime.  The showdown between Kenobi and Ginn fighting Darth Maul is another high point of the movie.  We got to see fully trained and capable Jedis and Sith battle it out over multiple locations and see how powerful they actually were.  

Liam Neeson's presence as the elder Jedi brought a touch of class to the movie that is lacking in the Disney movies.  I don't want to get into the Jar Jar Binks controversy.  The concept of an all digital character is interesting.  However the execution and comic timing is out of place in a film that should be a bit more serious.  However his antics are still funnier than the forced humor in the Disney movies.  One thing that should have been added to the film was Count Dooku.  He just appeared out of nowhere in the second film.  It would have cool to see Christopher Lee on the council and seeing Anakin as the danger he is.  It could have been an interesting subplot with Dooku being one of the Jedis who denied Anakin a chance at becoming one.  It would have added more substance to their subsequent encounters over the next two movies.

Love him or hate him Lucas set out to make the movies he wanted to make.  And the Phantom Menace is pure Lucas, for better or worse."
Awesome!!.. I love every single thing about the movie I really don't care what other people say but this is a Star Wars movie and this is a story that I really enjoyed
"It might have cringe-worthy dialogues, but it gave us memorable scenes with the podrace and Darth Maul."
"Groundbreaking visual effects are entertaining, but can't sustain a film alone. The heart of the story gets a bit lost in politics and action, and cold is the dialogue our talented cast is left to work with, but the magic of Star Wars remains"
I have a newfound respect for this movie after seeing The Last Jedi.
"Painfully average, feels the most like star wars, great fight choreography, amazing score, bland acting, unexciting script, criminally badass and underused villain, Jar Jar..."
It's not great but it definitely gets a lot more hate than it deserves.
"Look, we can all agree that the worst Star Wars is still better than the best movie that is not a Star Wars. An interestingly, we are able to test this theory by watching this movie, the worst Star Wars. It's bad, the acting is mind-numbing, and the plot is a mess. The Battle of the Fates is a great lightsaber fight, and Ewan and Liam do a lot of work to carry this movie, but they can only carry it so far. Jar Jar is an offensive disaster, and Watto is deeply problematic. But it's still a Star Wars, so include it in your re-watch marathons, just turn this one into a drinking game so that you can actually get through it."
"Aside from the awful dialogue, it had some epic action scenes."
Condenced sunshine of a childhood long gone.
