"THIS IS NOT A MASTERPIECE! Took what JJ started & spat on it and through it out the window, ""if Rey & Kyli are so similar why didn't Rey let Kylie get a force vision for the Skywalker saber😒"" ep2 & ep5 are 10x better then this clumsy mess"
"This was the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Perhaps the worst movie period. Other movies have been bad, but their awfulness was confined. The Last Jedi not only is terrible on its own, but it deals serious and lasting damage to the characters and world built by the preceding movies."
"I don’t have time for a full in depth review of this movie. There are various on YouTube you can watch that do it justice. This film is a mockery of Star Wars, disregards logic, and trivializes it’s audience."
"I would rather not watch it, than watch it."
Lazy writing.  Too many plot twists.  (Does every f*bombing scene have to be a plot twist???) Absolutely terrible character development.  Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen next to Jeepers Creepers.
"it is the worst star wars movie together with 9 maybe 
it just destroys star wars and made the not good 7th film which could be good? 
with another film which it set up
but they all are bad"
"I believe if Rian Johnson was the director of force awakens this could of been a good movie. The problem is that it fought with the movie that came before it in story, theme, and tone so much it just left a rotten taste in your mouth. It felt like two rich white boys fighting over who gets to play with their toys and how to play with their toys. If Rian got to direct all three movies in the trilogy I think the trilogy would of been great and if J. J. Abrams got to direct all three the trilogy would of been ok. Sadly J. J. Abrams got to direct the first and thrid while Rian got to direct this movie. This made this movie and the one after filled with your movie sucks and I can do it better no your movie sucks and I can do it better. This made the viewing of the movie, story, and trilogy disgusting"
"This is where the new trilogy slipped a bit off the rails. Entertaining, yet with at least one groan-inducting scene. Not bad, yet..."
This is a visually a stunning representation of the 8 episode saga that tributes the original trilogy while remaining original by itself. Simply the best since the the empire strikes back.
It was terrible. Im sorry for everything they've done to you Mark Hamill
"i like the actors 
everyone it's great but the plot omg 
painfully"
"I've watched the entire saga and I have to say this movie was one of my favourites, though the one after messed it all up, it was amazing."
I don't hate it or love it. It just erases what the last film did.
"I had never left a movie theatre angry until I watched this horrible insult to the franchise. Director Johnson will be shunned forever in the Star Wars universe and we all wholeheartedly agree with everything Mark Hamill had said about how he and all the fans were fundamentally disagree about the way the character in the movie is portrayed. Horrible last stand for Luke Skywalker, my childhood hero and of course a lot of filler and garbage and no actual real plot, aside from not running out of gas 🤮"
"This movie was bad on so many levels.  Let's begin with its connection to Star Wars or rather, the lack of connection with the source material.  It's as if Rian Johnson didn't care at all about the rich amount of material in the Star Wars universe and just wrote a generic sci-fi piece.  Every character was reinvented to the point of being almost unrecognizable.  This movie was such a divergence from the plotlines that had developed before that it felt like an alternate reality.

Star Wars aside, the movie failed on so many levels.  The plot was contrived, dull, and nonsensical with undeveloped points.  No Star Wars movie had ever been boring but this approached that level.

Sometimes you have to watch a movie multiple times to appreciate or understand a movie's intentions.  So I did watch The Last Jedi multiple times and it's still a bad movie.  I will even rate it as the second worst Star Wars movie with only The Phantom Menace being worse."
My favorite Star Wars movie of all times!
One of the best Star Wars films
"The worst and most destructive peice of ""art "" that I have ever seen in the film industry. For as large of a company as Disney to produce something this terrible is baffling considering how they have no shortage of money and resources. If you ever want to see a six film trilogy torn down in two movies just watch this abomination and then Rise of Skywalker."
"I've wasted a lot of time following two plain characters in a subplot that leads nowhere.
Really, you can cut those scenes un the casino and it won't change a thing.
And that's only one of the issues with this ""movie""."
"Honestly I have watched the saga marathon style many times and this I skip, a couple of others are sort of boring too but this is also.. well not in any way connected to the rest of the saga nothing makes sense."
"Worst Star Wars movie, ever."
"Don't believe any audience reviews about the Last Jedi.  Critics are right!  

The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson does a wonderful job in bringing new fresh to something old and familiar.  The story was great and the new force abilities are awesome as well.  Rian Johnson was able to expand the universe we all have come to love and give disney the ability to write spin offs for it (Broom Boy).  If you are the Star Wars fan looking for something spectacular and fresh, The Last Jedi is the movie for you!  

SPOILERS Ahead!

Most people I have spoken to express how they hated how Rian Johnson wrote Luke Skywalker, but when you actually come to think of it, Rian Johnson had to follow in the foot steps of what was developed in Force Awakens.   The question he had to answer is why is one of the most powerful Jedi living in exile on an island?  Why is Kylo Ren looking for him? Which are all answered within Rian Johnson's writing.  Questions are NOT left unanswered, and characters are NOT destroyed. 

Kylo Ren cements himself as a powerful force, while Rey continues her journey of trying to find her place within the story.  Rian's decision of making Rey a ""no body"" was Rey's worst fear.  Much like in Empire, Luke's worse fear was that his enemy (Vader) is his father.  It was the last thing Rey wanted to hear, but it is satisfying in a way because great power does NOT have to come from Family Lineage.  

The only negative about this movie is that the Canto Bight sequence was a little too long.  I feel like including the whole space horse scene was unnecessary.  It was like Disney was forcing Rian Johnson to include something about Animal Rights."
The last Jedi? What? I mean I’d say Luke wasn’t even a Jedi he was trained by yoda but that doesn’t make him or Rey a Jedi. Being a Jedi meant that you followed all the rules and you did all of what the Jedi council says. Luke wasn’t a Jedi because he didn’t follow every rule for goodness sake he force chokes someone not a jedi power and Rey don’t even get me started she probably doesn’t even know the first thing about being a Jedi heck in the last movie she didn’t even believe in the force.
The people at Disney should be ashamed of themselves for letting this piece of poorly written of cash-grabbing excrement loose into theaters. Someone should fire the person in charge.
"Definitly the worst star wars movie ever made, it is just a cheap nostalgia bait movie with no soul. Ruins plenty of good characters and has no redeeming qualities."
"As a long-term Star Wars fan, this movie really exemplifies where Disney chose to betray the audience. There's enough good material to make it worth a watch if it's free or a dollar, but honestly it's just a waste. It does not advance the story and needlessly kills off two characters. Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) could have simply disappeared gracefully, rather than having Disney tread all over her memory. Mark Hamill was pointless in passing. And... That's the movie. All of it."
Just bad. Do not recommend to anyone
"I love that movie !! I liked all the new ideas in the movie , and the fact that leave behind the old concept in the other episodes"
That milking scene is forever in my head. I wish i could erase my memory.
"A great movie which will seem better after time, much like the prequels. And especially in comparison to TROS, which is plain awful."
"This movie is just straight up disappointing, terrible script and use of characters which destroy a once treasured franchise."
"Disney sentences Luke Skywalker to the same fate as Han Solo - he leaves the stage a washed up old man, a remnant of a completely different cinematic universe which was adored by so many."
found more enjoyment opening a pack of duracell batteries
"I love Star Wars movies and I think this is one of my favorite ones, but there's a lot of problems with the trilogy. I think it's a bad trilogy because you don't feel a strong connection between the movies, but this one is a good movie looking for itself. It makes you feel surprised with a lot of scenes and you feel the emotion from the start to the end, that's incredible, but I think it's important to have a good trilogy, that's why I'm giving 7/10."
This movie is just a joke.
Really epic. Really beautiful.
"While The Last Jedi had some flaws (Rose mainly), it brings something new and very interesting to Star Wars.  It brings ourselves to a point where the whole plot resolves around 2 characters and their feelings instead of the repetitive inter-galactic warfare Episode VII gave us by basically redoing the plot of A New Hope.  It also describes what few understood from the prequels : nothing is all black or white, the Jedi Order failed because of their flaws, not because of the Dark Side.  Luke in this movie is the incarnation of this idea by being the broken old man that is so drastically different from the Luke we left in Episode VI."
"Best movie in the series, too bad JJ had to go and  spend half of episode IX to try and revert everything this movie did."
"A disappointing, plot hole riddled, pretentious film that seems to forget its part of a franchise."
"The movie was incredible garbage

Rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting"
"This one was not so bad, I think is the best of the sequels."
"This was such a disappointing film. I had high hopes for Luke to show how powerful he had become with the force but what they did to his character was almost criminal. A lot of the film did not make sense, too many plot holes to list and the casino planet.....why put that in at all?????  Just a terrible film and wasted opportunity."
"Rian Johnson a true fan of Star Wars and the mythology of the franchise created a magnificent film that really brought forth some great questions about the Force and the Jedi's place in this new era. Fantastic music by John Williams again and the visuals were gorgeous. Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were great and it was so amazing to see Luke Skywalker on the big screen again as Luke Skywalker. The final performance of Carrie Fisher is one of the best she ever gave and she will be missed. Chewbacca was great as always. Daisy Ridley again brought forth new depth and development for Rey and Adam Driver's performance commanded the screen with Kylo Ren's character. John Boyega, Kelly Marie Tran, and Laura Dern were fantastic too!"
Good film plot but slow in parts and the casino scene definitely wasn't needed a unexpected twist with luke skywalker makes the film even more enjoyable great experience.
"The director/writer clearly had no understanding of the Star Wars universe. They botched nearly the entire thing. There was also no understanding of characters, most notably Luke."
"Many dropped subplots from TFA and plot holes of it's own big enough to drive a Buick through.  The writing is jarringly didactic during certain chunks of the runtime.  Jokes that feel like they're from an SNL sketch  
It's a thematically strong, but a narratively weak movie- albeit a very visually well crafted one."
"such a disappointment
this is not a Star Wars movie I think"
"I enjoyed the film and it was definitely better than The Force Awakens and The Last Skywalker, but it couldn't help bridge the two films."
"Terrible excuse for a Star Wars film. I hate how they disrespect Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker character and turn Finn into a mindless goof. This franchise had so much potential, but fell far, far away into the deep void of money-grabbing space."
They should have just stopped with this movie. It's just bad
"When I watched this movie on the big screen, I was wanting more of Luke Skywalker, which the last movie was lacking of. While Luke has a lot of screentime in this movie, his writing betrays his original character. (Spoilers) Instead of being optimistic and wise, like in ROTJ, he just becomes a washed up hermit who gives up, even on life in the end. Also, the main characters are not interesting or written poorly. Finn, which was my favorite of The Force Awakens is now just a laughing stock and wasted character. Poe, which I also liked, now doesn't contribute anything and doesn't get any character development in this movie. Rey, from the start and now is just a dull and boring character."
"Wow, great way to ruin Luke Skywalker. This is what happens when you don't follow a plan or plot. I am not sure Star Wars survives."
"The Last Jedi is an incredibly polarizing film. It takes bold, unpredictable moves in developing Star Wars. Luke has become resigned and disillusioned, having lost his youthful optimism due to life experience and failure, and the central message of the film is to stop clinging to the past. 

Personally, I really enjoyed this film a lot. First of all, I find its philosophy of letting go of the past worth pondering, and find Luke's character arc intriguing. Moreover, if we take the film on its own merits, rather than making the standard of its success how faithful and respectful it is to the original Star Wars films, it is really good. The character development is strong. Luke finally overcomes his depression due to his past failure and manages a last act of dramatic heroics. Poe Dameron starts to mature in his judgment of leadership tactics, preparing him for the greater responsibility he will take on in the future. People criticize the casino excursion, but it is through this experience that Finn develops commitment to a cause, rather than to be independent and sell himself to the highest bidder. Rey and Kylo Ren go through a fascinating development, pulled towards each other and yet apart. This culminates in an awesome fight scene, where they team up together against a common enemy, and then part ways. It's one of the best Star Wars fight scenes, and Luke's final stand is a powerful ending. This has great characters, development and character arcs, incredible battles (space battles, lightsabers, and internal battles). It triggers emotions, and proposes a controversial philosophy for fans to discuss. 

As the most polarizing Star Wars movie, the Last Jedi is essential viewing. I'd recommend anyone to watch it, and to make up your own mind about it."
I hate this movie. My least favorite Star Wars movie by far. Ruins Star Wars Canon and is boring. It doesn't expand on the Star Wars Universe. The only Star Wars movie that I have walked out of utterly disappointed.
"The entire plot that drives the action is complete garbage, the nice cinematography and the quality of the acting are actually the only two things that save this movie."
"I'm honestly conflicted about this movie, when I watched it for the first and only time I would probably give it 4/5 stars but after I've thought about it I might give it 3/5 stars.  This movie had so many jaw-dropping moments and some of the most exciting moments for me but also a lot of moments that are insanely awkward, out-of place, and/or flat out gross. Since I'm so conflicted about this movie I'll settle with 2.5 for now."
"If I could rate this lower than half a star, I would. To be clear, The Last Jedi had the *most* potential of any Star Wars movie - the cinematography is *phenomenal*. The visuals are *gorgeous*. The music is, of course, fantastic. Sound and set design and acting were amazing. It has the prettiest lightsaber battles in any of the 9 films. But the plot is horrendous. There is nothing innovative about the storytelling. The writing is Non. Existent. The characters - old, new, and otherwise - are so horrendously written, that it feels like the story was written and re-written well into post-development, and it doesn't seem like the writers, director, or editors really had any clear vision of where they wanted the movie to go. The Force Awakens was mediocre and borrowed far too heavily from the original trilogy, but it actually introduced some fun, interesting characters and actually had some consistency and introduced a whole lot of really cool, interesting plot and character arcs that could have had great payoffs, but I wanted to wait until Episode 9  to really weigh in. And after seeing the entirety of the new trilogy a handful of times each, including back-to-back-to-back, and Episode 8 had a ton of cultural importance and tons of potential, and it left the trilogy - and the franchise - bereft of logic and sense and consistency. I don't believe that Rian Johnson is a bad director - his work with Knives Out, Looper, and Breaking Bad were nothing short of astounding, but what he did with this movie was an unfortunate misstep. It's unfortunate and disappointing, and there simply isn't enough room here to address the 'why' behind these, but suffice to say that what could and should have been a magnificent film and bridge between episodes 7 and 9 failed in story, plot, and character to the point that the things that it did well did not matter in the least."
"Disney took a lot of risks with Star Wars and failed miserably and The Last Jedi is unfortunately not an exception. Incoherent plot twists, lack of character development and just an overall messy movie. One of the worst Star Wars movies in my opinion."
"The best Star Wars movie in the Disney era so far. From a technical level, it is the best Star Wars movie so far, it's cinematography is rivaled only by Rogue One. It is well acted, well directed & well edited. Kylo Ren, Luke Skywalker & Rey are the best parts of the movie. The movie tries to juggle too many ideas & themes, and can often be self-indulgent in auteur theory at the expense of being accessible to as many Star Wars audience members as possible. But then again, i'm just a pretentious Star Wars fan who loves themes, themes, themes & has always advocated for the writer-director approach to film making, so it is exactly my type of film. I rank it as my 3rd or 4th favourite Star Wars film."
"A pretty good film, significantly better than the rise of skywalker. I actually liked that Rey was just a nobody."
"Useless movie, was not made to complete de sequels, lies, deception."
"Ambitious and challenging work.
I saw a glimpse of the new era of Star Wars, but It became ruined in RoS."
"The Last Jedi was a very bold Star Wars movie and many risks were taken. I believe more of the plot worked than did not and worked out to be a very good movie. The Last Jedi set up episode 9 for something that could be both great and something that Star Wars fans have never seen before in Star Wars movies. Reys parentage reveal was something people could relate too as it sent the message that you don't have to be a part of a blood line to be something great. Luke having problems I didn't mind since he came back in the most bad ass way. The Snoke decision is something we have never seen before and set up the next film for something new. Ultimately, the Last Jedi is a fantastic entry to continue on to episode 9. Best of the sequel movies and would make my top 3 Star Wars movies."
"The force awakens which was great movie got me so excited for the last Jedi, specially at the end! Unfortunately It didn't live up to the force awakens! The films is okay but it just feels very messy and I don't like what's they did with Luke."
There was so much potential in the star wars series for a sequel but Disney blew it with these movies.
Even as one of the better constructed and plot based films in the franchise;Star Wars:The Last Jedi lacks the fun and heroism of it's earlier installments.
"Although the movie has some undoubtedly good parts, it overall brings down the value of the trilogy. Luke is no longer Luke, there are random spontaneous love stories, Supreme Leader Snoke remains a mystery, there is major issues with continuity dealing with the world building put in place by the past two trilogies, and even the newer characters have their potential wasted."
Such an enormous disappointment on the first viewing. Particularly everything with Like Skywalker. The second viewing was actually worse - Fin was sorely misused. Gutted.
Worst Star Wars movie ever!
"this film had a joke of a plot direction, with all the side story's it just got annoying. Acting in this film was even worse than the plot line, with all the actors only using facial reactions to express emotions, half the time I was trying to stop myself from laughing at this joke of a film."
"I understand playing with rules and breaking them, but when you create a plot whole in the rest of the series you really messed up."
"This is my personal favourite of the sequel trilogy
It is full of unpredictability, exciting scenes and builds up the characters well, especially the interesting plot between Rey and Kylo Ren.
It follows on well from The Force Awakens.
It is certainly action packed, and therefore may take a couple of viewings to fully understand what is going on."
"One of the greatest cinematic accomplishments for Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi subverted expectations and challenged fans of the series to ""unlearn what they had learned"" while maintaining the themes of what makes a good story: failure, hope, and redemption. While the movie, unfortunately, misses the stylistic feel of Star Wars, the decision to move forward in bold and creative storytelling, rather than fan-service moments, has allowed this to be a movie that will be marked as one of the greatest in the Star Wars franchise."
Bad plot. Bad fight scenes. Bad writing. Good looking (thanks to Disney money). The sequels should not be allowed to call themselves part of the Skywalker saga. Bring back Lucas.
I never want rian Johnson to touch anything Star Wars ever again. Disgraceful to Luke skywalker.
This is a Star Wars movie that is thoughtful while still being entertaining and thrilling. The best performances in the entire saga from the whole cast. It's a film that will grow more popular with time.
Nothing was good about this movie. They changed Luke beyond acceptable ways. They answered nothing from the previous film. They subverted expectations to just subvert expectations. So many insane plots that never were explored. I absolutely hated this movie... I have never hated a movie more. They had to try to back off of everything in the next movie that made it awful too.
"It is by far the worst Star Wars movie. There is hardly a plot element which is not laughably illogical, some grotesque even. They should have given the job to someone who actually likes Star Wars and understands the very special way of storytelling the series deserves. Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac are fantastic however, but there are better films to enjoy their performance."
"Great movie - stunning actors, amazing visual effects, a coherent story and most importantly it's just great fun!"
I think TLJ is the most interesting of the new trilogy because it begins to move the story forward again and it does some things no Star Wars film has done before. Instead of the juvenile good/bad duality we get shades of gray. Characters make mistakes. It’s a very human Star Wars film. I liked it.
"Mesmerising, visuals. Daisy and Adam's on screen chemistry is truly amazing. You can see the difference in both's position while also seeing a similarity for both Rey and Kylo. Beautiful film!"
Even the last part of the trilogy wanted to delete those facts and happenings it did. It is so depressing that it could score that high.
it is very confusing in which direction it goes in and leaves me wondering what if would of been with george lucas
"Really unfortunate in direction, but I suppose stories have to change.  Despite my feelings that these aren't the characters that were developed in the original trilogy, it was the terrible script and nonsensical screenplay that drove this movie into the ground.  The constant tonal shifts in a single scene took dramatic moments and turned them into confusion about what we were supposed to be paying attention to and subverted any character development.  How critics defend this is beyond me; the movie is a bad movie, not because it's a Star Wars movie, but because it doesn't adhere to basic elements of meaningful cinematography and story telling."
"It's one thing to make a movie with plot twists and defying expectations when it makes sense and without throwing out everything that has come before it. It's another to change characters entirely and throw in expectation defying moments all for the sake of surprising the audience. Good cinema isn't about surprising the audience, it's about telling a good story that keeps audience interest. You can get interest from twists, but when those twist exist for the sake of throwing the narrative on its head, you have a problem with your movie."
"The most unnecessarily controversial movie I've ever seen. Yes, the casino plot was unnecessary, but all the Rey/Kylo stuff was great, and the Luke outrage is insane. A man who was taught and mentored by Yoda and Obi-Wan, who both made a sizeable mistake and went into hiding for years, would make a sizeable mistake and go into hiding for years, and that's out of character? Give me a break. Rian Johnson is brilliant, as always. It's not perfect, but anyone saying it ""ruined Star Wars"" needs to grow up."
What a waste of budget and special effects
"With The Last Jedi, they brought more depth to all of the characters, and the actors really nailed it with this one. It is stunning visually and beautiful to watch everything play out in front of you. Of course, there were a few moments that seemed out of place but overall a very good movie!"
really awful and wayyyyyyyy to long
How can you ruin such a great saga
"Absolute dumpster fire of a movie. 

Wouldn't be half bad if it was a stand-alone film and wasn't called Star Wars, but it completely botched it's place in the sequels by retroactively changing characters established motives and personalities, prematurely killing off the established villain, reusing old characters, and adding in way too many plot-conveniences. 

For sure played a huge role in why Rise of the Skywalker was such a mess - JJ couldn't salvage Ryan's mess if he tried."
I thought is was excellent. The only thing I don't love is some of the stupid dialogue for Poe. Haven't like him in the last two movies. He seems to hate taking orders from women. Really stupid is such an advanced world.
"La pelicula mas controversial de la saga, y estoy del lado de los que la ven con buenos ojos. Mucho se critica el hecho de que Rían Johnson ""destruyó"" por completo la escencia de Star Wars, sin embargo yo pienso lo contrario. Es una historia nueva, totalmente arriesgada, no busca complacer con fanservice al espectador, si no contar algo nuevo, algo desconocido, tiene la mejor fotografia de toda la saga. Buenisima pelicula."
"I could waste my time pointing out all the plot holes or how they ruined one of the best characters of the franchise, but there is not much more to be said. Rian Johnson is a good, up, and coming filmmaker/writer (check out Knives Out, Looper) but not for Star Wars. I wasn't thrilled with Force Awakens and believe Harrison Ford, the only reason why that film is watchable. I thought things would go up from there, boy, was I wrong. I knew this was going to be shit show, right when Poe, did the mom joke at the start of the film. I haven't bothered to watch the sequel, and I don't think I will ever."
"This is my personal third favorite Star Wars film behind Empire and the original. I think the direction was well crafted, the cinematography was beautiful, they expanded on the lore in a really interesting way, and they also expanded on the character of Luke really well from the sweet kid we knew from the originals, to a man who has been through trauma. My only problem with this is the Finn and Rose subplot. Other than that, I love this movie. I think it's a great expansion on the Skywalker saga, and also just a great film in general. 
     I think a lot of Star Wars fans go overboard with hating this movie because they do new things that weren't expected. However, when Episode XII came out, fans complained that it was too much of the same. I think this is a beautiful and emotioal continuation and expansion of the galaxy far far away."
Why does everyone hate this movie so much it kinda good
"A great take on the Star Wars Saga, with enough new twists to keep the audience entertained."
This movie is beyond horrible. If this movie was left out of the franchise I would be happy because this movie shouldn't have been made. And don't get me started on the overrated red throne fight scene. That scene is so poorly done and I've never scene a worst fight scene. If you want proof look up Robot Head the last Jedi review and watch it for a deep dive on the abysmal scene. This movie is terrible
"Huge amounts of plot holes, horrible dnd home adventure with a star wars sticker slapped on."
Worst Star Wars movie. Everyone in this movie is either stupid or an ass. The only good sene is the throne room sene but then you realize how bad the fight choreography for the guards is.
"Honestly, the movie is...intersting. I like the story and it's actually a good idea. The characters are fine and the acting is ok but man the way it was pulled off. Captian Phasma's fate is wasted potential. Imagine HER becoming the Supreme Leader. Wasted potential. Luke's fate as well. The movie is overral fine"
The Worst Star Wars film by far because of the worst plot ever.Its destroying Character of Luke.
I hated this movie at first but after seeing E9 I like it a bit more. At least they tried to be creative in this film
I hated this when I first saw it on the big screen. I rewatched it recently and couldn't believe how much stuff I missed searching for the nostalgia TFA gave me. It's actually a really solid movie and I really enjoyed the second watch.
"I honestly don't understand why this film was subjected to such criticism by audiences, it may not have been the no holds barred thrill ride of its predecessor, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good film; it is indeed more of a slow burner than episode VII, however the build of the plot is well paced, and the finale definitely feels earned. Yes there are a couple of scenes that seemed a little out of place upon first viewing, but once one has revisited this film, one can see exactly why each element was added, and the plot is well-constructed. The only major criticism I have is that Snoke's character was criminally underused, and discarded rather abruptly given the limited screen time we get with him in the flesh, but apart from that it lived up to the hype, and is a fitting follow-up to what has been a very strong series of sequels."
"Everything negative has already been said. I've watched it just now for the first time since I saw it since it's release. It's a much much prettier movie than I remember, and being prepared for the...choice....turns that the movie goes into makes it easier to ride with. However, it's still garbage, the flying superman bit is still jarring, Poe is annoying, Finn is idiotic and Rey is too OP. If star wars was a football team it'd be the Cleveland browns."
It ruined the whole franchise beyond recognition
"Bad no, very bad, it has no connection whatsoever with the previous one, everything the previous director did because of his eagerness to play a leading role, he does not know what TRILOGY means, it seems that he wanted to give his own ending to the saga, instead of give a continuation to the next movie, the starwars mythology is loaded, that the next movie is going to go, that's the big question. The prequels have more history than this."
SORRY KIDS BUT THIS FRANCHISE WAS OFFICIALLY OVER WITH AFTER REVENGE OF THE SITH!!!
"The visuals are stunning and the score is absolutely fantastic. The acting is great, but sadly the plotholes are plentiful. Also definitely dragged on especially with the absolute waste of time side mission that Rose and Finn go on."
"A daring attempt to bring lots of new and exciting views into the starwars universe: the indifference to good evil and humanity of the military industrial complex, the role and difficulties of women in leadership, how sometimes problems are bigger and can't be solved by the actions of a few chosen heroes, and more. Unfortunately they were only able to accomplish them by dumbing down characters and washing out motivations and arcs, causing the story and the messages they wanted to convey to suffer greatly. Beautiful visuals display the budget, but overall not worth a watch."
Definitely not as bad as people say it is but I mostly didn’t enjoy this film. I loved Kylo Ren in this movie
An opportunity to continue Star Wars as epic - but alas it was lost and this is by far the worst of them all - if it had only been the last.  The treatment of Luke Skywalker was unbelievable and the story was terrible!  Do or do not - no try!
An absolute abomination of a film..  insulting to the past trilogy and no coherent direction for this new trilogy.
I simply hate it. May the force be with Disney. Alw.......ehm maybe?!
"This movie spends too much time on unfunny jokes and pointless plot twists that take the movie nowhere. The movie also wastes 30 minutes on the Canto Bight which is the most uninteresting and boring thing that I've seen in Star wars since Attack of the Clones. This movie also underuses and wastes Finn's character, which is a shame because he had one of the most interesting backstories of any Star Wars character. Rian Johnson also does not seem to understand the rules of the Star Wars universe, and trying to watch this movie after the Original Trilogy is frustrating. On its own, this movie could shine, but it doesn't seem to have a place in the Star Wars saga."
Great visuals but the story is so dragged out and horrible decisions were made where you cringe
Terrible story line that focused on an unnecessary side story and didn't answer any questions from the last one. The CGI was impressive though.
"Tragic! It ignores every film in the series. This film is full of awkward moments, bad jokes, forced relationships, major plot holes, and they managed to turn the franchise's captain America into everyone's drunk uncle. Forget about killing the past, this film killed the franchise. I can't even watch the previous films without feeling frustrated."
"This movie is proof that if the original Star Wars was released today, the fandom would say it's not the Star Wars they fell in love with."
"There were so many bad decisions made in the making of this movie. There's no need to list them all as other reviewers have done a pretty good job already.  I get the idea the director was going for, and I didn't like it.  A very strong dislike.  I liked the actors and the whole ""mise-en-scène"" because I love everything Star Wars... except the plot, and in how some characters were portrayed. This movie is Jar Jar Binks. yeah.."
The single worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. As a huge fan of Star Wars this was a atrocious addition to the Star Wars movies overall. I wouldn't wish for anyone to see this movie. From certain people floating in space and miraculously surviving to certain people fighting against a galactic force by themselves without consequence to awful needless humor. For the love of god do not watch this film it will ruin Star Wars for you
"Bad story writing, unnecessary new characters, terrible direction, and a step back from the force awakens which promised an interesting new trilogy and characters."
I HATE EVERTHING ABOUT IT THE CASINOP WAS A WASTE OF TIME AND THEY KILLED THE ONLY GOOD CHARACTER LEFT BESIDES LEA THEY KILLED LUKE!!!1!!!!
A disappointing and failing attempt that branches out the Star Wars universe in a disastrous way.
Worst Star Wars movie ever. That says it all.
It's good. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎
Boring. Terrible. Just as the others.
Nothing to keep in this movie except some special effects . Not even an entertainement. I'd rather tear my eyes out than watch this movie again
I dont even know what to say here... Its just really really bad.
Visually stunning with amazing acting. The character development was extremely honest and real. Beautifully done.
It made me uncomfortable.
"Beautiful cinematography, character development, and acting. This is one of my all time favorite Star Wars movies."
"Absolute rubbish. Poor story line. Poor character arcs. Countless plot-holes, inconsistencies and movie-mistakes. The director clearly does not understand the concept of space and gravity. Total waste of time. What a slap in the face of George Lucas"
This was a great episode in that it made me decide not to expect anything from new episodes of Star Wars. There are so many wtf scenes that I couldn't understand.
"Green Lantern was better. Star Wars is a great franchise,but this movie is a waste of time. A ticket to get bored especially with Rose"
A well made movie. Not a Star Wars movie though.
I personally feel this movie is underrated I recommend watching this movie it's not has bad has some people have said there are some plot holes but no movie is perfect
That final battle was awesome. Haters still gonna hate though.
Worst writing and directing in any Star Wars history.
Garbage...complete garbage!
Not as bad as everyone says but not as good as everyone hoped.
"Many people do not like this movie. I remembered walking out of the theather with a biterrsweet taste after watching it. But not because the movie was bad, but because what took place on the story. Yes, it has plotholes. And maybe some wrong decisions. But I think the main problem is that people wanted to see something different on the screen. Things that did not happen. But that does not mean the movie is bad!"
"The Last Jedi is a beautifully shot Star Wars movie. It has palpable energy, twists and turns, top notch acting and stellar sound design. There are some issues with the plot but there are only two Star Wars films that don't share this problem: Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980). It is just a movie after all."
"Best film of the sequel trilogy. It made bold choices that pushed the series in a new direction that was unexpected, and wasn't just a rehash of Empire Strikes Back"
Not to surprised on this one
This isn't star wars. This is a poorly put together fanfiction of star wars.
"Leaving where the Force Awakens left off, Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to be trained by Luke Skywalker, in the 'master refuses to train the pupil but eventually does' cliche. Meanwhile, the Resistance Fleet is naturally being chased by the First Order -- it isn't Star Wars if the rebels aren't being chased! The Resistance finds safe harbor on a salty planet, but their safety is short-lived as the First Order brings out the Walkers in scenes too reminiscent of the Empire Strikes Back. If you like odes to the original trilogy, then you may enjoy these scenes, I for one, thought the film  was too recycled and could have used some additional creativity. At least go to a non-white planet to make a last stand! Is that too much to ask?"
"More disney garbage, destroying the saga. Thanks so much for taking a beloved franchise and turning it into a big, steaming pile of shite."
"worst sw movie ever, broke my heart"
"The Last Jedi is a truly special movie. Everything is on point. From the characters to the direction, to the cinematography, the writing, the story, and the feeling the movie gives you. This is everything I've ever wanted from a Star Wars movie because everything in this is something I didn't know I wanted. 
The Force Awakens was good, but it borrowed too much from the original Star Wars movie. This is a unique story that goes in a bold new direction, whilst also being a love letter to the fans who have stuck with the franchise for this long. It also brilliantly ties together the themes from the previous movie. I once thought that nothing could ever top The Empire Strikes Back, it could never be done, but Rian Johnson proved me wrong, creating the BEST Star Wars movie."
"The best one of the sequel trilogy.  Surprising, emotional, great action and amazing tone.  I can see where you're coming from, if you didn't like Luke in the movie, but it wasn't a problem for me.  Just sad it got destroyed by the big fans, because let me tell you, the critics and the casual fans adored it."
Disrespectful and incoherent steaming pile of garbage...
This is such a different view on the Star Wars series in the Skywalker story and so enjoyable and the force connection is a different way to tell the story of Rey and Kylo
It's different from all other Star Wars movies. It's extremely entertaining and makes you think about the jedi order.
Best Star Wars film since the 80's!
"This is probably the weekest Star Wars movie of the franchise. I mean it has no story, they misplay several Star Wars characters, and there are many plot holes that easily could've been solved. And they killed off one the most beloved Star Wars characters, Luke, in such a cowardly way: He just sat there and meditated instead of facing Ben in person. So overall, super disappointing."
The score is because what they did to Luke Skywalker. Totally destroyed character.
"I would like to justify and conclude that the sequels should have not happened especially the last Jedi. All these critics praising how good of a movie this believe they are star wars fans but in reality do not understand the consistency previous movies and comics embraced which ruins the whole dynamic of it. Apart from the inconsistency, there are so many plot holes and loose ends that are never solved throughout the sequels. I still do not understand how people think this was a good film."
Ruined Star Wars for me.
"As a Star Wars movie it's among the worst. As a film on it's own it's laughable how poorly constructed the film is. The more I thought about the actual plot the more I was amazed how awful it was. 
 Why didn't any of the star destroys just hyper-speed into the main Resistance ship? This is the film that introduced the concept of hyper-speed being used as a weapon so it baffles the mind who the writer could have missed that simple detail. And that's just one of it's many, many, many problems.
Cherry on top it gives one of the most infamous examples of character assassinations in Luke Skywalker's portrayal and it only breaks my heart that Mark Hamill gave his all in this performance and only shows how committed the man really is. 
TLJ  may not be the worst film I've ever seen, but it holds a strong contender for my nomination."
Il film di Rian Johnson si distacca e ricerca nuovi temi nella saga. Questo è frutto di un film molto profondo che è molto più autoriale di quello che sembra.
"The visuals were amazing. Looked great. Sound design was pitch perfect and the CGI was seemless. But I come to Star Wars for the world and the story which wasn't present beyond deconstructing the plot and fan theories by the director. It wasn't much a story, more of a screenwriter monologue about being invested means nothing since anything can be dismantled, subverted, killed or omitted enitrely. Didn't feel like a continuation to the story of The Force Awakens, changed everything about the film in a way that cuts off any overarching plotlines, breaks canon by utilizing the in-universe technology in a way that makes space battles pointless and feels like a 15 minute episode rather than a 2 hour feature film. I like Rian's work but he himself said that he hates working with an already built universe and especially with a story that isn't enitrely under him control (he prefers one-off stories, which seems to be perfect for his style). The Last Jedi was a mistake that derailed the entire trilogy and begun the downfall of Disney Star Wars"
"There were so many inconsistencies and problems with this movie. How do you even begin. First of all, Disney is just hell bent on destroying the origional cast. Poor Luke.... they RUINED him. How can you turn one of the most beloved characters in all of cinema in a matter of 5 minutes. ""Let's turn him into a bratty five year old who doesn't want it anymore"" they must have said. They ruined him so much I was a little happy when he died. That's crazy. And talk about a horrible ending. You set up snoke as this big bad guy only to kill him in a split second with no big pay off at the end!? Dude I got sent back to thoughts of highschool blue balls watching that ""scene"".

But then... there's the inconsistencies. The last movie ends with a solid win for the rebels, and then picks back up with them LITERALLY ALMOST EXTINGUISHED.  The goal of the last movie was to give Luke back his saber... and he throws it away like it's trash. The first movie sets up Rey's parents as something special... then only to be let down in the second movie. And don't play the whole ""but she was palpatine's grandaughter"". BS. Why tell us they aren't important just to let us down for no reason??? There's no pay off in that. Let's have the big bad destroyer struggle to catch up to a ship who's already on their last straw and can't jump to light speed. BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE. Then Leia is magically a Jedi!? How the hell does that make sense!? They ruined Han for this!? I can go on and on but I'm sure you stopped reading. Thanks for ruining Star Wars!"
It's obviously the wrong way to go when making a trilogy. There is something new and I can give it that but they lack who they are.
Com certeza o mais ousado desse nova trilogia por isso o considero o melhor.
Really well done. Fun movie and hope for future Star Wars
"A fresh approach to what a Star Wars film can be. Enjoyed the overall messages presented in the film. The broken Luke Skywalker & the Rashomon style look at his failure was interesting. Really liked the connection between Kylo and Rey, especially with how it was presented."
"Rian Johnson has always taken risks in his films, and I liked the outcome from The Last Jedi. It is far different from the other Star Wars films, there are some unnecessary characters and the code breaker quest wasn't great, but other than that it was a successful departure from the usual Star Wars formula."
"The themes and ideas introduced are intriguing. I love the Luke/ Rey , Kylo/Rey dynamic in the film. Pacing is a bit off ( i hate space horses) but is still a very carefully crafted film. Also probably the most visually breathtaking star wars film."
"Una arriesgada y poca esperada jugada de Johnson, quedé shockeado."
It haven't been until now that I have seen it. I am happy I did not contribute to pay a ticket. Empire Strikes back rip off. I didn't like it one bit.
"For the record, I'm not usually this disappointed by a frachise movie, since the movie's exciting big-budget action scenes mostly make up for any plot holes that may have existed in the story. But, the Last Jedi, for some reason, was very disappointing. Not to mention forgettable. You know, when I walked out of the theater, I basically only remembered fragments of the whole movie, and a few hours later, I was having problem recollecting even those fragments (that's something very detrimental for a Disney movie, is it not?). 
I think the fundamental problem of this movie, above all else, was how the movie presented the viewers with more questions when it should have focused on keeping track with its prequel, the Force Awakens. So what happens is that the viewer, after watching this grand new installment, has some issues connecting the movie to the previous ones. And that leads to forgetfulness (especially when the sequel's less intriguing than the prequel). To elaborate, what's up with Snoke? In the former movie, he was depicted as some mystical Sith lord with powers beyond imagination (well, I guess that's why he never showed his true capablities). But in this movie, he's just some senile man enveloped in golden robes who does nothing but die in a matter of seconds. What is this? I don't get it. If he trained Kylo Ren, shouldn't he, at least, get some scenes showing off his powers and then die? And what about Captain Phasma? In just a momentary flash, she's falling to her doom. If I were to hazard a guess, it seems that these antagonisets are being killed on purpose to give more room to some unknown new threat.
I get that Rian Johnson wanted to do something different from J.J. Abrams. And he does add some fantastic scenes to the Last Jedi, such as Luke teaching Rey the ways of the Force. But he should have paid more attention to that connectivity snag (because, if a new episode of a long-lasting series is not connected with the rest, like I said, it becomes a thorn in the saga's side). Then, maybe, the movie could have been better."
Strange choices. Inconsistency. Huge problems with plot.
"Too long. Too reminiscent of George Lucas's slippery downfall into bad CGI and too much action, while thinning the story. Thought Disney was supposed to make this better?"
"Ha tenido opiniones divididas pero, más allá de alejarse o no del canon, me parece que como película tiene deficiencias serias de estructura."
"If you want to know why this movie is bad, go on YouTube and watch the long analyses people all over this planet have put out. This movie was filled to the brim with character assassinations, terrible choreography, and no knowledge of the Star Wars lore. It’s an awful movie. Why did the critics love it? Was it because it SUBVERTED expectations? Well, yeah, my expectations were completely diverted when people did things completely out of character. You would think that Luke’s lightsaber (Anakin’s lightsaber) would mean something to him, with all the history it’s seen. But he throws it over his shoulder absent-mindedly and calls it a “laser sword”... a Jedi’s weapon deserves more respect. I think it’s completely out of character that Luke attacked Kylo in his sleep. LUKE, who didn’t give up on his father when everyone else already had. This was like watching a terribly made fanfic where the writer hated Luke for no reason and wanted to make everyone hate him. I did enjoy when Luke faced Kylo, but then he DIED. I remember watching this in theaters, shocked, thinking, “Did they just kill Luke?” I didn’t like it when Leia Mary Poppin’ed back to the ship with the force. Everyone described this as “Mary Poppins” and they are absolutely correct. I dare you to watch footage of Mary Poppins and compare it to Carrie Poppins in this movie. They’re twins! I think they should’ve killed Leia off right there, because Fisher died. It would’ve made sense and would also be heartbreaking, along with adding depth to Kylo Ren, as he had hesitated. Rey was very perfect in this film, which makes her a badly written character. She lifted all those rocks with the force with no issue and was better than Kylo and Luke without any effort. It’s impossible to connect and relate to a character who doesn’t mess up (though Rey is less perfect in TROS, I’m talking about how THIS movie is). She’s extremely powerful! And when I say this, it’s not because I can’t handle a female Jedi. For example, Ahsoka Tano is a character who makes mistakes constantly and everyone can relate to her. Ahsoka is powerful (ex. decapitating four Mandalorians at once, surviving a duel with Vader), but her skills feel EARNED because she’d been training her whole life. Rey hasn’t. Finn was a useless addition to this movie. He’s a coward and when he finally decides to sacrifice himself to save everyone, Rose swoops in and stops him. I was fine with Rose’s character until that point, when she broke into prequel dialogue and said, “it’s not about destroying what you hate, it’s about saving what you love” and then KISSES HIM. Poe meant nothing to me, and Holdo was annoying. Kylo went shirtless for some reason. Snoke died. Ackbar died. Hux existed. The throne room fight looked really cool until you watch it slowly. Go on YouTube and look at an analysis for the fight and you’ll understand. This movie was so bad, and I remember during the Canto Bight scene I checked my watch and wondered how much was left and when it would get good like the critics said. It didn’t. This movie looks like a flawless unblemished apple from the outside (the visuals, the excitement about how things will be after TFA) but it’s rotten once you break past the skin."
Jesus FUCKING Christ that was like taking a shit in a sock and having to stuff it back up.
"Well, this movie is not that bad, ok two halfs of the movie are just crap lets face it but the other half is actually preety good; I know that if two halfs of a movie are bad the whole movie must be bad,right? not at all, because when this movie fly it fly high"
"Put simply, this movie is dull, retcon garbage, with a story that sounds as though the writer didn't know, or want to know how this universe works. Destroying  narrative tropes left and right doesn't make you a visionary.  It makes you a lazy try hard.  But Ryan Johnson wasn't simply content with destroying this movie, but destroying any chance the follow up to this movie will be any good either by killing off the primary antagonist and guaranteeing that the follow up has to engage in some serious mental gymnastics to even make it half way interesting."
"Biggest disappointment of my life.
Jar Jar >>>>>>> Rose"
"An entertaining but flawed ride brought to life by its philosophical heart associating with Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren, yet dragged down slightly by the meaningless adventures the other characters go on."
Just stop Disney. Just stop.
"Terrible.  Watch the Robot Head critic videos on YouTube.  Makes you appreciate the ""bad"" prequels that I grew up watching."
"It's completely justified for a Star Wars fan to feel disappointed about The Last Jedi (Snoke dying without backstory, Rose existing, characters being worsened) but ultimately I think that Rian Johnson's decision of putting lots of emotional weight and new elements into the Saga makes it better. Sure, there are a lot of misfires (Leia suddenly has the Force, Luke throwing away his lightsaber, ""laser sword"", Holdo, long runtime, Phasma just dies, plot holes, etc.) but that doesn't stop the movie from being interesting. The cast is does a great job, most notably Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Andy Serkis, the special effects, action, and score are all expertly done (besides Rey botching a move when fighting the Praetorian Guard), and Kylo is still a complex, if she babyish, villain. Overall, it's a good Star Wars movie but it's not as impactful as The Force Awakens and the Original Trilogy."
Mark Hamill is gorgeous!
My first star wars movie. It was fun!
"I think people really underrate this movie. Sure, it isn't great.... The pacing is kinda bad, and I can also see how this could be disappointing to a dedicated star wars fan. The scenes on Canto Bight are really bad. Although, I see where Rian Johnson was going. He was trying to change Finn from someone who just cared about himself (in Episode 7) to someone who really saw the negative effects of the empire. This leads to him willing to give his own life for the cause later in the movie, which is really beautiful. I'm really disappointed, though, that they didn't let him die, considering he did next to nothing in episode 9. I really liked how Luke died, along with that final battle. I love the direction Rian Johnson was taking the series as he made the light/dark side a little less black and white. Episode 9 just forgot all of that, of course. The light speed ramming scene was absolutely magnificent. I really didn't like Vice Admiral Holdo, as well as the fact that she just blatantly didn't tell Poe her plan, leading to that enormous waste of time and wasted of a plot line. Overall, this is a underrated, not very good, but exceptional in many areas, movie."
"Poorly executed, illogical on many parts"
"Pros: Pretentious acting and disturbing, non-linear script.
Cons: Impressive special effects and great  costumes."
Total garbage. Shittier than the prequels.
The entire movie that had one good wallpaper. There is no comprehensible decisions. Video game cutscenes are written better.
super boring. they ruined everything about star wars
"I know this movie gets a lot of hate. I don't hate this movie. I used to, but I give this movie another chance and liked it. It's a pretty good movie. It's pretty weird, but still good."
"Complete waste of a film. As far as I am concerned 7, 8, 9 do not exist."
Best Star Wars movie in a long time.
This is one of the biggest let downs I've ever experienced the movie is just bad stale characters boring plot bad pacing a lot of unnecessary stuff dude humor and forced social commentary this would be bad on its own but what makes it worse is that it's Star Wars this film clearly has no understanding of what made the Star Wars franchise a success and blatantly undermindes it this film is an affront to the Star Wars franchise
"After Star Wars VII, which was controversal to say the least, Disney made a real Disney Movie. 
Weak Story, little to zero character development, plot holes in dozens and an unmotivated Luke Skywalker. 
I love the Star Wars franchise since the first movie but the new movies...just dont feel like Star Wars anymore."
Only a few important characters but still probably my second favourite Star Wars Movies. Kylo Ren RIPS
"annoying charecter made with respectable actors and where is the emotion, you would that we should see luke skwalker mourning the death of han. everything is a mess."
Dump beond imagination.
WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE THIS MOVIE?!?!?
la verdad que estuvo bastante bien cosa muy chula se vieron en esta película
"la pelicula no tiene sentido desde principio a fin, con una escena de un casino que no encaja en la pelicula y la profanacion de personajes fundamentales

deberia ser eliminada del canon"
This movie is a shame. It destroys the plot that was built by the classic and prequel movies.
This film would have been better if Geoge Lucas never handed star wars to Disney my verdict it is one of the worst star wars films
"Did they even try to make a movie? it goes from one political theme to the next, even the dialogues - every speech has a message.
And then most scenes end with a flat joke. 

they should delete TLJ from the trilogy and only make it 7 and 9. You wouldnt miss anything."
"The Last Jedi has impressive technical effects and cinematography, and shows Rian Johnson is a compeling director, despite its narrative choices and plot twist are left to be desired, but are retroactively redeemed because of The Rise of Skywalker's nerve to correct the previous' narrative flaws."
the best star wars movie ever. it was different and one of the best blockbusters ever. My comfort movie 🥰
"Most faithful, bold and interesting Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back...even if it’s somewhat messy getting there"
"Out of the latest trilogy, this is by far the worst. Out of all the Star Wars films, it is still the worst. It has a few cool scenes in it, but it feels poorly written, sub-plots that are completely unnecessary (such as the whole Casino Planet scene), and what's most frustrating, is that by the end of the film, nothing really happened. The plot hasn't really advanced at all, a couple of things happened which could have been done within 20 minutes, but everything that The Force Awakens set up, and got started, Rian Johnson took an element of that and went more in a direction that he wanted, rather than just what would have been good for the trilogy and the saga. He ruined Luke Skywalkers character, he ruined the possible development and direction Snoke's character could have taken us, Finn's character development from the end of The Force Awakens was removed from the start of The Last Jedi, there was no good character development AT ALL in the whole movie for anyone and when you summarise the movie, nothing actually happened and was basically boring with a few elements that kept it just about interesting. To put simply, if they said that they were going to remake Episode VIII (and then be able to improve Episode IX because of it), with the same actors etc. but a new writer or JJ Abrams, and assume The Last Jedi never happened, I would be all up for it."
"The more I watch this film, the more I appreciate it. Living in a post-Rise of Skywalker world makes it seem even better. While it does take several missteps with Finn and Rose, the scenes with Rey, Kylo, Snoke, and Luke are some of the best Star Wars I have ever seen. This was a film I didn’t know I needed."
Worst of the Saga. It subverted all expectations in a terrible way.
"There are some dull scenes, but they are made up for (mostly) by an interesting story and awesome action (Luke vs. Ben was great). 90%."
"As you watch this movie, you get the sinking feeling that the writer/director didn't take the time to learn the history or lore of the past stories, or even seen the original trilogy and had simple cliffnotes of the previous outing. 

From WWII bombers in space (Where was the Y-Wings, exactly?) at the beginning to the slow spaceship chase scene that lasted for two thirds of the film, Star Wars The Last Jedi spits on the legacy that came before and then hacks up a political diatrade of ill defined characters with paper thin motives, while blacking the eye of existing characters and have them mired in a story that goes nowhere. 

This is the worst Star Wars movie ever put to film, and I would rather fire up the Holiday special than see this again."
Even a John Williams score could not give this tired film enough artificial respiration to keep alive.
Worst Star wars movie ever.
"This is my favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them. I really enjoyed the storyline and the characters in this plot. I know people have nostalgic feelings with Darth Vader but I really believe Kylo Ren is a superior villain of the series. Overall, it is a great movie with great action, cinematography, characters, and storyline. Snoke was the only bad part of the film."
"All in all the movie just felt odd, and not quite Star Wars. Everything that was built with the new characters and the story in The Force Awakens seems to be thrown out the window in this film. Rose was a terrible character addition, and one that certainly shouldn't have been front and center in the development of Finn's character. The Rey and Kylo scenes were just weird, and felt as a distraction to the Luke and Rey storyline. Although, in the grand storyline they make a little more sense after seeing Rise of Skywalker, with their connection, but in real time they felt more random and out of place when they did occur in The Last Jedi. Poe was one of the best characters in TFA, but in this movie it felt like he took a backseat to Laura Dean's atrocious character. And Since when did Hyperspace become a weapon? It took 8 movies to introduce that? This movie has it moments but it feels like a complete one off from the saga, and not a continuation of the story."
Film is all over the place
"Basically an extended version of the Battle of Hoth (The Empire Strikes Back) in which its plot was evidently based on too, lacked content that was relevant to the story and contained irrelevant characters and sub-plots"
"One of the worst films I have ever seen (and I've seen some terrible movies in my time). 1 dimensional characters that are inconsistent and ridiculous; plot holes; boring slow motion chase scenes that last the whole movie, 30 minute pointless scene in the middle of the movie; no link to the previous movies; no direction for the subsequent movies; flat jokes that are completely out of character; stiff direction with failed attempts to subvert expectations that become boringly predictable after the first few minutes of the movie....."
"Rian Johnson did something that JJ Abrams was afraid to do, ""MAKING SOMETHING ORIGINAL."" Fans were too greedy, and picky about Luke Skywalker's change, while the change itself is actually quite fitting. Rian Johnson must be praised for this masterpiece of a movie."
"The plot was bad. Luke Skywalker was ruined. Hyperdrive was ruined. Kylo Ren was not treatening at all, because he had already lost in the last movie, now he lost again and he became just a joke. Snoke was for nothing. The cassino planet part was very boring. Rey still a mary sue. Worts Star Wars movie I've ever seen. It's a shame."
"This is my favorite of the sequel trilogy. Now, it's not flawless but the biggest problem of this movie is the structure. The first act and the second act are both equally long which is not the traditional structure of making a film. The second act is usually 1/3 longer than the first act. Another issue is that the film is comparatively slower paced in the first act. Regardless, it is a great entry in the franchise and my third favorite Star Wars movie. It is however not the best movie in the sequel trilogy because the Force Awakens was better paced and edited

A 9/10"
terrible. just terrible
"I absolutely despise all that Disney has done in all three of the ""Star Wars"" ""movies"". It doesnt fit anything the last 6 movies have done and I am holding out a small bit of hope that the new disney CEO completely cuts these movies out forever and always."
"It definitely subverted my expectations. Good job on that I suppose? I think Disney should let this franchise go to rest. We need new and fun movies anyway, not dusted off, dug-up corpses of what used to be great classics."
"Oof, that was rotten..."
"They're doing too much with this one. The story is not very well thought-out. Leia flying through space is the most absurd thing in all of the Star Wars movies. This one isn't up to the standard of the Star Wars brand but relative to other movies in general, it's fine."
"Bad, ruined my star wars."
Absolutely better than The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker.
My favorite Star Wars movie besides Empire. Loved the performances of all the actors involved in the film. The story was interesting and very well directed. The mystery between the connection of Kylo Ren and Rey kept me very intrigued and I loved the bit with the green milk the Luke drank; it made me laugh! Don't understand all the hate?!
"Rian Johnsons direction with The Last Jedi is something fresh that the Star Wars franchise needed.

really sad that they didnt build on his direction for episode 9."
Painful disaster by Rian Johnson.
Beautiful and perfect Star Wars Film. Great sequel to TFA.
Franchise breaker. I wish i could un-see this
"Certainly more engaging than its predecessor, this one may be less of a crowd-pleaser but is more rewarding."
"It committed the cardinal sin of any bad sci-fi / fantasy movie: it was boring. The long drawn-out chase that lacked tension or surprise made the movie feel longer than it was.

The second act was goofy in a prequels kind of way, and the story beats that the second act followed ended up not mattering. The star protagonist of the decades-old franchise, Luke Skywalker, was lazily written as the tired old ""guru hermit"" trope by a writer who clearly didn't understand the character, who seemed afraid to explore any growth or change the character may have undergone in the intervening decades. The conclusion was awkward and left the story pretty much dead ended, handicapping the filmmakers of the follow up. 

Its only saving graces were a pleasant aesthetic style for many scenes, and some solid acting from several members of the cast."
"nothing really happens, it's probably the most skippable movie of the whole saga (apart from episode ii). how ever ryan johnson manages to give the film great aesthetical value."
One of the worst movies I've ever seen
"The Last Jedi somehow takes what seems like a dead end from the Force Awakens (in my opinion) and creates a very good film. With incredible action, shocking plot twists and unforgettable moments, its biggest problem is that it doesn't feel like a sequel to the Force Awakens."
Star Wars: The Last Jedi gives Rey and Leia some beautiful scenes along with some epic battles. The film is a journey well worth taking. Amazing Visuals as well.
"Awful is all i can say, ruined the franchise."
"For the first time since Empire, Star Wars fans get an original and inventive Skywalker saga chapter."
"Incredibly lazy and low quality writing, forcing political ideas in sf movie couses that poe even thou he did everrhing right is being yeld at all the time by his perfect Co officers, the admirals ship crash manouver is lazy idea  that leaves grand holes in all future and past space bettle tactics, destroying galaxy greatest hero, portreid as bitter weak old man, even Mark H. hated the new Luke, weasting of Snoke character, ect"
"Brings new life to a franchise that, otherwise, might be doomed to become eternally self-referential."
"The only Star Wars movie I hate more than this one is Rogue One
(Yes, Rise of Skywalker is bad but not as insulting as this one)"
"Nonsensical plot-lines, unexplained character actions and reactions and universe-defying ""new science"" make for a sloppy, ""worst-yet"" Star Wars installment. Calling this story a bold move is about as generous a description as could possibly be merited. The film offers absolutely nothing in the way of character arch and ignores every speck of groundwork laid in ""The Force Awakens"". When stripped of its entertaining visuals and underlying nostalgia, this film is nothing short of a complete disaster."
"The sound came back as a proper ""character"", as every Star Wars movie should be. 

Cinematography, and performances are excellent as well. Be prepared to meet someone special one time again... (Patience, you must have) LOL"
"I think The Last Jedi is excellent for me, but I don't know why audience give some low score. Maybe audience saw the film was slow or something lack. However, the film is still have some imagination, moral lesson and emotional feeling upon this film."
"Great movie, introduces new elements and characters, while still remaining true to the veterans on set. Didnt enjoy it back in 2017, but i love it now ... go in with an open mind and expect to find a great movie"
Disney abandoned basic story-telling to make garbage cash-grab.
"While the movie wasn't without fault, including the seemingly unnecessary casino plot and an unfortunate waste of potential for the development of Finn, this is easily one of the most beautiful movies in the Saga, is built around an incredibly strong theme (failure being the greatest teacher), and features the best dynamic between light and dark characters in any of the Star Wars movies."
this film was a complete waste of time
Garbage. A rushed movie that does know nothing about the characters. Awful jokes.
"Skip it - it gets rightly recanted in the saga finale. The worst of all the Star Wars movies by a large margin. Made by someone with no love for Star Wars, and that should not have been. Choose any other Star Wars movie and you will see a 3-5 star movie."
"Una increible pelicula (aunque los fans no lo puedan entender) con grandes momentos, una narrativa increible, y un aire distinto a todo lo antes visto en Star Wars, sin duda alguna una obra incomprendida, dios quiera que el tiempo la trate como se merece"
"Overall, The Last Jedi was amazing! The only big problem I felt was the whole Finn and Rose thing. Otherwise, everything else about the film was a huge win for the sequel trilogy."
"This was the worst star wars movie by far, a position episode II had previously held for me. This movie had the worst plot of any movie, brought in useless characters, ruined cannon star wars concepts (like weaponizing lightspeed), and worst of all, Johnson completely destroyed the character of Luke. So thankful that Abrams sequel undid so much of what this movie tries to ruin."
"Almost at the level of ""Atack of the clones"""
Absolute garbage! Anyone who would give this 5 stars is not a Star Wars fan.
It was a star wars mpvie...not much else to say then that
"It was a good film in general, but it did more bad than good to the star wars franchise and I didn't mind the character of rose. I thought she COULD have added great character development to Finn. But no. What they did with her was bad. Apart from the throwing the lightasber off the cliff thing, I loved what Rian Johnson did with Luke Skywalker. Watch the film once you've watched episodes 1-3 then Solo then Rogue One then 4-7."
crap dont waste time or money or air
it was absolute trash
"This is probably the trickiest star wars movie there is. Most critics love it, while most fans despise it. In my eyes, with no bias or personal feelings, this is not a bad movie, yet it is severely flawed. I think it is a good addition to the saga and a good movie overall. With bias and personal feelings, however, I would say this is my favorite star wars movie."
The chemistry between Ray and Kylo worked for me. The casino scene was dragging.
"Repugnant film. Reylo glorifies abuse. I loathe that. Additionally, I despise the character assassination of Luke in this film. Try to avoid seeing this movie at all costs!"
"You have to take the good with the bad.  Some of the best Star Wars, but also some of the weakest."
Amazing. Best movie in the sequels. It was filled with secrets and logic and amazing cinematic shots.
I don't understand why the actors were bullied but this movie wasn't very good
"I was doing a marathon of all the Star Wars movies, and to not be sad, I stopped at the Return of The Jedi. This is the absolute worst Star Wars movie, and I know I'm not the only one whao thinks that way. Please, save yourself some time and don't watch this. Disney is trying to kill everything that we love."
"It is the best movie of the new trilogy. The storylines, the visuals, the throne room fight scene."
I have nightmares over the fact this piece of trash is canon star wars.
I can only assume anyone who liked this movie has never actually seen the original trilogy.  It's complete shite and Rian Johnson should NEVER be allowed near a franchise film again.  Luke wanted to kill his nephew?  That's an odd character development for the person who risked their life to redeem his father who was literally the worst person in the universe.  And hyperdrive is now a weapon?  Seems like the whole Rebel attack on the Death Star would have gone a lot better with this bit of knowledge.  WTF...
"This is not a poorly made film technically but it is a poorly thought out chapter to the new trilogy.  Rian Johnson believes that simply subverting expectations of the audience is enough to save Star Wars and keep it creatively fresh. I don't believe people come to see a Star Wars film to be told ""nothing matters"".  No this is a disappointment to the franchise and it sticks out like a sore thumb because TLJ does not carry the story laid out in TFA smoothly and consistently.  Instead Johnson decides to throw out everything set up in the previous movie to do nothing with it.  Yes Rian very creative indeed.  It's just a mess, the film just feels like it's going nowhere and the handling of some characters people were looking forward to seeing was just heartbreaking.  I'm a big SW fan but the sequel trilogy is more enjoyable without TLJ."
"I have never seen a movie that destroyed a franchise so much.  The plot is about the resistance/rebels running out of gas, and the first order catching up.  They somehow managed to ruin the Jedi, the rules of Star Wars, And didn't offer anything in return."
This movie was disappointing. It really subverted my expectation that I would enjoy Star Wars wars.
Worst SW movie ever.
A Very good movie. The story told is great
"A tight race between this an Phantom Menace for the worst of the series. 1/3rd great with good concepts and could have been a good way to twist the same tired SW story, another 1/3rd that should have been left on the cutting room floor, and another 1/3rd that is the most boring version of the a submarine movie ever produced."
"This movie is horrible in all senses.
It doesn't have continuity at all and destroys it's universe all together."
"Honestly the worst movie ive ever seen. On release during the first scene of the movie i had to walk out just because of how utterly ridiculous it is and how they throw away all the previously established physics involved in space travel. On second attempt i had to stop once i saw someone flying in space thanks to the force. Finally years later i forced myself to watch it entirely, What a damn mess and waste of time, This is garbage. Please actually pay attention to what your making. Worst direction and choreography ive ever seen. Alot of the inner character decision making also makes little sense. This whole trilogy should honestly be redone properly with a set goal in mind other than to include more woman. As it stands, this should be lost in history and forgotten."
"UGH THIS MOVIE, It was so boring with the Resistance running away from The First Order and that stupid Casino planet with those horses.  However the parts with Rey and Luke Skywalker were good.  So I think this movie was fine.  Everything ended fine with Luke Skywalker teleporting a ghost of himself accross the galaxy and then actually still on his island.  Everything was all going good and THEN HE DIED.  WHAT THE HECK!!!  He appeared on his island and looked like he was going to die but then he was okay and I was satisfied and THEN HE DIED FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THE STUPID DIRECTOR."
It literally ruined everything The Force Awakens did and had a really weird plot and was just so bizzare. i can't see what Rian Johnson tried to do.
"So Good! This movie takes gamble which mostly pay off. I loved the portrayal of Luke as soured and bittered by the history and failure of the Jedi and the choice to make Rey's parents nobodies. Excellent movie, defiantly the best of the new trilogy and will hopefully be remembered as the 'empire strikes back' of the trilogy."
Didn't like it.  Worst since Clones
Derailed the whole franchise...
"It's a not a good movie it's more of a waste of time, but that's living up to its purpose due to the fact that its preparing u for the last chapter of the art like action compacted saga!"
"Absolutely fantastic such an improvement from force awakens this movie completely captivates Luke from the extended universe and truly show the power kylo and Rey posses the only bad part was the casino scene it felt a little useless and took longer than it should the Crait scene where rose doubles Finns speed and hits him from the side is sweet but also kinda made me go ""I'm sorry huh"""
I'll happily take a break from 'Star Wars'.
My favorite Star wars movie. It was made with passion and respect to the Saga.
"One of the best of the whole saga. Visually powerful, it has some of the best scenes of the ST. The character's evolution is awesome and feels organic. We will always be longing for Rey Nobody..."
"Star Wars something: The Black and Red One. 
I am a proud nerd and a Star Wars fan and a movie buff and I've already forgotten which number this is. 

Turns out unfortunately that this entry is not a very rewatchable one. I remember almost every scene and got no more enjoyment watching it again. Rian Johnson has crafted a movie of scenes and his spirit and very little else. This time, that's not enough for me, it's not enough for this franchise. 

The twist of Rey's parentage is equisite and equisitely acted and very beautifully simple. I'm praying they don't retcon it in Episode: The Next One. 

Full of pointless scenes and contrivances this is filler that leaves all characters for the worst. Still it looks great and the battles are nice and it doesn't reek of reshoots like every other blockbusters these days. Shame this wasn't Johnson's spin off instead.

It's a collection of fantastic ideas and rippling potential, eclipsed by muddy execution, lack of meaningful plot and character progression and multiple scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor. An accomplished movie but illicits neither deep introspection or fist pumping elation as the credits draw over the experience. Rian Johnson may be a better director than writer, choraling together something entertaining but not inspiring and ultimately pointless."
"Entertaining. Ties up the riddle of Rey”s lineage Kyle Ren’s outcome, and  the end of the series. I don’t go to a movie to critique the movie i go because I want to be entertained."
"It's fkg great, well written, beautiful cinematogry and it has the best acting of the whole saga. I think it's funny how Ryan Johnson understands the Force better than Lucas when he did the Prequels, he reinvented it and made it interesting. Plus Rose is the most underrated character of Star Wars, she's great and it sucks that she got replaced by some dude and just got 2 minutes of screen time in TROS. It's as good as Empire Strikes Back. Anyway great movie watch it"
Plot holes on plot holes Leia is now Mary Poppins and Luke drinks alien titty milk Rose and Snoke are pointless characters worst Star Wars ever
It took 3 attempt for me to finish this.
"While it can be enjoyable at times (mainly just seeing Luke back) it's undeniable that this film completely misses the mark on what a Star Wars film should be. The first scene of the film sums the rest of it up with Luke chucking the lightsaber over his head which could almost be seen as a metaphor for Rian Johnson scrapping the story that was set up in The Force Awakens. Overall, distasteful to say the least as a Star Wars fan and really fails at capturing anything worthwhile. However, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is always good :)"
"This movie is good for nostalgia alone, but don't expect anything original."
Did not enjoy it. They are ruining the Star Wars franchise.
I can't even tell how much I hate this film and how it ruined everything Star Wars has established so far without writing an entire Bible.
"See it a second time, and it'll become one of your favourite films in the entire saga."
The movie at the start was great then it got really boring and you start to wonder what is the point of this star wars movie in the new saga.
"Trash, threw Luke as a whole away, fucked up hyperspeed, Holdo sucks, Rose Tico sucks, better than Rise of Skywalker."
"What a waist.  Took all ll the history, backstory, and potential and shit on it."
"The movie fails to be true to what the characteres have represented in the past. It is entertaining as an independent movie, but it is not a decent piece of such an important saga."
"I don't know how to feel about this movie. It's beautiful...but kind of pointless in the overall story of the trilogy. Every time something interesting is presented to the audience, it is almost immediately taken away. My expectations were very high going into this movie, so I was disappointed."
"The film was better than the precedent, but the movie is the second SW worst of the saga, another failure ! All the characters was bad but only Rey & Kylo  are the worsts of all (again). It was good to see again the old characters before (Yoda's cameos was the best), but the movie fail in all ways, copy-paste again in epis.5-6 & the fights of lightsabers was bad and dumb! Really shame of the saga:("
Almost impressively boring. It excels at hating its characters and the audience watching it. Rian Johnson is baffling.
"Why are y'all still tryna put this movie down? The Last Jedi gave the trilogy that substance that it needed to survive. Luke's character actually had depth and meaning, while still paying homage to the original series. On top of that, this has the best cinematography of literally any star wars movie... Ever. Almost every shot in this movie could pass as my desktop wallpaper. 

Everyone seems to miss the whole point of the movie. They're mad that Luke is a grump, they don't like that the good guys didn't win, and they don't like that Poe and Finn's plan didn't work. The whole point of the movie was that failure is the best teacher, as said by Yoda himself. Luke is a sad dude in this movie who later redeemed himself through one of THE COOLEST force abilities ever. The resistance badly looses to the First Order, but still manages to survive in incredibly small numbers. 

The biggest problem with this movie, as well as the other sequels and prequels, are the fans. They don't know how to accept change, even when it is necessary. That's the exact reason why George Lucas HIMSELF sold Lucasfilm to Disney (for an extremely undervalued price of $4B). He was burnt out. And the catalysts were the fans who harassed him in the streets and online for ""ruining their childhood"". What's he supposed to do?! Make the same movies over and over again? That's not creative. Might as well waste your money on something more productive, such as... I don't know... Making a new movie with new ideas..."
"A complete and total cinematic catastrophe. Sure, Rian Johnson had to make a follow up movie to JJ Abrams soft reboot of the original Star Wars, A New Hope. This limited him in who is characters were and what their struggles would be. But that's what happens when you sign on to write and direct a film IN A TRILOGY. It's just amazing that Kennedy allowed each movie, in a multi-billion dollar franchise, to not be planned out. They had no plan! This movie sucks so bad."
This is one of the worst movies of the decade
"I must say that I was very disappointed by this film. It has some good moments in it, some funny moments, but I have major issues with some of the plot choices made by the writer, the overall unevenness of the pacing and lack of internal logic in places.

Yes, there are bold choices made in this film, but for me those choices mostly didn't work. Too many of the established characters were completely wasted in this film, as well as some of the new ones, and that probably disappointed me the most. Things also don't add up or make sense if you really think about it. It's as if the writer was going out of their way to subvert expectations for the sake of subverting expectations. I really enjoyed Episode 7, despite the well-trodden ground it walked on, because it was fun and stayed true to the established characters and lore. But in Episode 8 things are suddenly so dire and hope is completely lost. It undoes some of what was set up in Episode 7 seemingly for the sake of being different or played for laughs.

I wanted to really enjoy this film, but the flaws are just too great for me to do that. It will also be the first Star Wars film that I will not be buying on DVD or Blu-ray."
Boring and inconsistent schlock
Worse than the Star Wars Christmas special
"The most well made, well written star wars movie of all time."
"This movie was pretty good, entertaining at times but slogs a bit in some parts.  
Overall it didn't feel like much changed in the state of the galaxy.
Luke's character did seem off to me, I can make some sense of it, but just some odd stuff."
"Filme muito bom, que vem com elementos novos para o universo de Star Wars, saindo da zona de conforto."
"Stupendous! Best Star Wars Film except for maybe The Empire Strikes Back! Rian Johnson is a genius! Great writer-director! TLJ excels at innovation and being bold and fresh taking Star Wars in a new relevant direction with mature writing not the infantile awful Fan Service of Rise Of Skywalker! Great Character Arcs, Witty Dialogue/Banter, a story that flowed but didn't contradict the previous installment or Episodes 1-6 but enhanced them to be sure - a great achievement, just sad Rian didn't finish Trilogy or at least Kennedy/Igor let Trevorrow continue his masterpiece Duel Of The Fates from where Rian left off! Terrio & Abrams are hacks, worst director-writer team for Star Wars ever. PLEASE don't let them do anything else. No more Star Trek, no more Star Wars, God no Indiana Jones! Abrams is a superficial slick action director only who couldn't tell a good story to save his life! Rian Jonson is the Master Storyteller second only to Lawrence Kasdan if that. Love The Last Jedi, the single most complicated, mature, enriched installment of the Saga!"
This film has few redeeming qualities. A moronic joke made by Poe at the start of the movie sets the farcical tone carried throughout this failure of a blockbuster. The only undeniable success of The Last Jedi is its ability to completely wreak havoc upon Star Wars canon. I wish I had my time and money back.
"While I definitely understand what turns people off about this movie, I found more than enough good material to compensate. Things like the lightspeed ram, the throne room fight, and the Yoda cameo (I love Yoda) made this a must-watch. For those who think the bad material is too overwhelming, I point you to Endgame. Endgame has tone of flaws with its lack of action, character development, heart, and story for 90 minutes. However, the fantastic final act compensates for this and makes it a great film. That is how I feel about Last Jedi. It is very flawed, but also contains some of the best material in Star Wars history."
Quite possibly one of the worst written films of all time. Writer/Director Rian Johnson wanted the characters and set pieces all to be in specific places and didn't care about getting them into those places. Humour which destroys the tension of the entire scene and an absolute focus on being unpredictable no matter the damage to the story and world as a whole. Someone at LucasFilm in future desperately needs to make sure there is an overarching plan in place if they do more trilogies and make sure the director does not have absolute control over the script.
"If I could give this movie negative stars, I would gladly do so. What a waste of money. Long live the EU."
"This movie was phenomenal in so many ways, from the director to the story group, the actors to the stunt team. A must see!"
Please never let Rian Johnson touch Star Wars again. What a betrayal to the Skywalker saga.
A MELHOR PARTE DO FILME É QUANDO VOCÊ PODE IR EMBORA. LUKE JA FOI TARDE! VELHO OTÁRIO!
"Personally, I think the deviation from the tired old trope we saw beaten to death in The Force Awakens is a stroke of intelligence, and people hating on this movie are quite frankly doing so out of a limited mindset.  Then again, Disney declaring all non-movie plot lines non-canon is also out of a limited mindset, so they're also at fault here.  But this is a genuinely good movie that doesn't just relive the glory days like The Farce Engorges did.  Good on J.J. Abrams for taking a bit of a step back here.  It definitely made a difference."
"Hated how they dealt with Luke story line. Story was disjointed and wasn't cohesive.
One of the worst Star Wars movies ever."
This movie had no depth and love in it. SW8 was just a shallow experience.
"This movie has a lot of bad stuff, but it has a lot of good stuff as well.Although I like this movie I'm gonna have to admit that it is flawed.Captain Phasma was wasted potential.I don't like that they made General Hux a joke.I hate the casino planet subplot with Finn and Rose.Poe is kind of dumb in this movie.I like Kylo Ren and Rey in this movie.This movie definitely shut down the whole ""Marey Sue""argument.Luke Skywalker is definitely the best part of the movie.I love his character arc about him rejecting his ""status"" as a legend.The cinematography is probably the best in the saga.This movie has equal good and bad which is why this movie is so dividing.For anyone who doesn't like the movie I think you should watch it again with an open mind."
Worst film in the series
"How to ruin Star Wars. I wouldn't say this ruined my childhood like others, but this ruined what could have been a good trilogy."
"When I first watched this movie I hated it. But looking back I can appreciate it for what the movie did and brought into the Star Wars universe.  Even though it is a bit messy, the movie has an important message to tell and exhibits great character growth. Rian Johnson has amazing directing and story-telling skills, and while he may say what you don't want to hear, it is what you need to know. This movie is akin to the Empire Strikes Back, which is why it is my second favorite Star Wars movie of all time."
"I just saw this movie for the first time because I heard it was bad and wow was everyone right, they ruined the franchise and my childhood."
After waiting a lifetime to see my favorite fictional hero of all time return to the theater I was unbelievably disappointed and consider my time as a Star Wars fan at an end.  I will not see the movie that follows this
"Where to start?  When they disrespect the main theme and character of the series, how can you expect the movie to be popular?  No originality, no new ideas, everything about these new movies feels rushed.  Just make more action sequences, forget the story, nothing new here except the special effects."
Terrible movie. The story made no sense and was completely unbelievable. The special effects were excellent but in the end if the story is bad it doesn't matter.
I enjoyed the directors vision for this movie
The only thing this movie was great at was aiding in destroying a franchise many have loved for decades.
"This movie was over-hyped from the beginning, & that doesn't help. I don't have time to rant like I normally would, so I'm going to detail my top gripes in bullet point-form. 

- Luke died without ever showcasing the strength of the most powerful Jedi
- The Finn & Rose side quest & romance to CasinoRoyale was pointless
- Chrom Trooper was again, a weak character
- Benicio Del Toro's character was not interesting enough for a 1/done appearance
- Admiral Holdo was uncharismatic on screen, although allegedly an interesting character if you read StarWars novels.. 
- Leia not only didn't die after being sucked into space, but instead Mary Poppins-ed to the nearest space-door. 
- Snoke seemingly died a pointless death

Awesome things about this movie
- Music
- Alien Puffins
- Rey & Kylo fighting as a team"
"Fell short, but not Phantom Menace short"
So much potential... all turned to scraps and jokes. Disappointing
jesus christ how the fuck can you even go so wrong with star wars
"The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie ever, with a confusing plot, useless characters and scenes, and a complete misinterpretation of the things that the Jedi, the Sith, Luke and the force are"
Ideas for a great Star Wars Movie: 1) Let Leia fly through space. 2) Lets make a chase of space ships in slow motion 3) Let the hero die of exhaustion. What a boring piece of cinema.
"This was a great movie. It did what the forst two in this series failed to do - make it feel like a true star wars film. I feelike the 1st 2 couldve been told in one film, and this could've been told in two. But, all in all it is an excellent film."
"lack cohesion to the other 2 movies in the series. the story is a mess, the writing is horrible. this is a too lack of plot planning and character development. shows a profound lack of understanding in multi movie planning, the star wars universe and pacing of events. shame on you"
"Pretty terrible in terms of narrative structure and the overall execution of the film's attempts to deviate from Star wars themes and original canon, the acting for a lot of the characters often feels forced, cheesy and stale, as well as some scenes that were probably meant to be taken seriously I found hilarious, and I'm not even going  to try and go into detail about the various potholes in the movie, it was just very all over the place and disorganised it's path, and I can't say Any of the messages it was trying to convey ever really made themselves apparent or made a huge impact on me, overall it was just kind of a meh movie, and I wouldn't really reccomend it I'm afraid."
Star Wars really has lost its way since the originals. These new disney ones suck.
Lots of excellent choices were made. Several that are questionable. The movie has stunning visuals and compelling dialogue. Which is not something that can be said of most Star Wars films.
Trash soooooo bad. Don't watch it
"This new trilogy (episodes VII, VIII and IX) is completely dispensable and should be ignored, as it completely distorts everything that was previously done about Star Wars in films, books, games and comics"
"Rian Johnson knows how to make a movie, tell emotional stories, and allows the audience to be a part of the experience. Best SW sequel."
Loved this movie.  The emotions that came about were very real.  The way that Luke had cut himself off from the force and didn't know that Han was killed in TFA was very raw.  My family and I watch this movie all the time.
Episode 8 was terrible. Why anyone at Disney let this pass I'll never know. Episode 7 was good enough and episode 8 had the chance to really pull me into the characters but seriously fell flat. Losing Han in episode 7 and then Luke in 8 was absolutely stupid. We knew we had lost Carrie Fisher at this point so before episode 9 came out we knew we had lost all the original characters. Pretty pointless to watch the movies at that point.
Holy hell. I'm 52 and have seen all 8 star wars movies ( plus the 2 side movies) in the theatre. I consider myself to be a huge star wars fan. Not after this streaming turd. Unwatchable. Princess Leah dies and floats through space? But wait! She's not dead! Um ok. A casino. Why? A prison cell  who is the mysterious guy? Who cares?An hour long chase. Who is chasing whom? why are they chasing them? Who knows? Who cares? It's action and exciting! Why is Luke so angry? Who knows? Why do Rey and the other characters have the personality and charisma of a wet dish rag? Who green lit this? How do I make it stop? Please God make it stop! This is so bad I won't waste my time seeing episode IX. This movie officially killed a franchise.
"Finaly a fresh take on the tired Star Wars formula. Not everything works and the three main characters could have been utilized a little bit better here and there, but overall they all get three very strong arcs. Probably the first Star Wars Movie since the very first one, that's actually true to what it preaches.

This would have been a great jumping off point for the Finale of the new trilogy or even a new one. Sadly, that didn't happen."
"I'm a fan, I really think they did a good job in ending Luke Skywalkers journey. It didn't feel​ rushed. the whole movie was fun to watch with some funny parts and also kept you wanting to watch more."
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
This movie is a perfect sequel to The Force Awakens. It challenges the characters with unique situations and adds a much needed chemistry. Not to mention adds iconic scenes to an iconic universe. I can't say enough good things about this movie.
"The entire plot is predicated on the fact that Holdo doesn't tell Poe the plan. That's ridiculous. If she tells him what the plan is, the entire movie doesn't happen."
"You get the sense almost immediately that there is a disconnect between The Last Jedi and its predecessor.  It might've worked as a standalone movie, or if I had forgotten about The Force Awakens, but it wasn't and I hadn't."
"A destruction of the tenacious character created by George Lucas, Luke Skywalker's falling film was a brutal assassination by Rian Johnson."
"Repeating things that have already been repeated. The rebels-up-against-it plot, with heroes worn down to the nub of their fighting spirit, feels like a rehash of Rogue One, and the attempts to echo the look and mood and darkening design of The Empire Strikes Back makes clear that the new trilogy is an official monument to nostalgia."
"This has to be the best Star Wars film in the 2nd trilogy, it's unique and the movie is overall beautiful to look at."
"The best film in the sequel trilogy and my third favorite Star Wars film. Rain took risks, and they PAID OFF! A film that Star Wars NEEDED ❤️"
"Exciting new series, but alot of stuff didn't make sense because of the classic Disney of making a character so naturally overpowered and convincing kids that you don't have to work for years and decades in order to be a master at your craft. I HATE MODERN DISNEY"
"The subplot with Rose and Finn was a tough to watch but better on a second viewing. Not a perfect film but thena great entry to the franchise. I love how they developed the characters of Kylo, Rey, and Luke in the movie. The best lightsaber battle of the new franchise is in this mov. Some great visuals all around with great ca decent story to back it up. Again Finn and Rose are not my favorite but the rest stood out."
It changes everything you knew about Star Wars. This movie makes every lasting changes to the star wars universe and contradicts the entire saga. It is also filled with so many false endings that you loose touch of the movie by the end. Rian Johnson seams to write in plot twist after plot twist that do nothing but confuse the audience. He subverts expectations so much it becomes meaningless. It also does not build on the seventh film and does nothing to set up the next one.  Disney clearly had no strategic plan for the trilogy as a whole.  It should be written as one story and the movies are split up into three parts.  A very confusing and boring move to watch.
"worst movie of all the starwars franchise. 
Really didnt want to see episode 9 because of this.

They literally threw all of the building up to starwars over luke's shoulder....."
"The Last jedi was, In context of the Star Wars Saga and the surrounding trilogy of moveis, completely inacceptable.
The Writing is painstakingly convinient and full of contrivances that ignore not only the in universe rules but common sense and yimple logic."
I thought it was great and took the right direction for the franchise. People seem to find the dumbest things to complain about but honestly the plot and direction was spot on! People complained about TFA being to similar to ANH but then they complain that this movie didn't stay true to the mythology. I think this movie went the absolute right direction.  Bravo!!
Pointless. Get ready for a wild ride that leads nowhere.
"This was rough..I mean if you have a movie with three primary story arcs and only one of them goes anywhere (just barely) than what is even being accomplished. There is a whole story arc that ends up having no baring on the plot in anyway and certain character choices left you baffled (not in a good way). I still haven't figured out what the story was supposed to be or what was even accomplished. This movie is a pure mess and gets 1.5 stars on the sheer strength on the impressive visuals and good music (albeit recycled music. If you're on the fence about seeing this, don't."

"This film is a great example of innovation in Star Wars, a thing that it need it! I definitely love it😍!"
Dives the series into bold and creative directions. Character arcs have depth and complexity. Subverts expectations because it's specifically *not* shameless fanservice.
"I loved the visuals. Really loved it. But I didn't ejoyed the story at all. It's a shame that jonson didnt get his own trilogy because he is good, but writing only this episode, ruined the whole trilogy as a whole."
"Just an insult to previous writers, directors, and fans. A huge segment with the casino was worthless. Characters doing things that make no sense whatsoever. Breaking the fundamental laws of how things work just for a stab at wow factor. I left the theatre feeling confused and unsatisfied."
Worst film in star wars history and an utter POS.
"When a trilogy is made-one would assume the three movies would be written together so they flow into each other. This movie was confusing, erratic and made no sense from the force awakens.

The subplots added nothing- the casino was ridiculous- adding new characters but getting rid of main ones made no sense. Finn deserved a much better plot and separating the main characters was a terrible idea.

Also- Luke Skywalker not wanting to help, never leaving the island and him not wanting to help- was not what Luke would've done.

 Also, Rey, was never properly trained and there wasn't one lightsaber fight and they didn't even mention the word- called it laser sword instead- so dumb.
The movie was an insult to life long Star Wars fans."
Such a bad movie. Especially the throne room scene. That fight made no sense. Also how did Rey become so powerful so strong with the force. With ZERO training
They tried too hard for shock value and ruined a character in the process. Also the whole Poe vs Holdo thing was useless plot that ran in circles and wasted time.
Maybe it's because I just really love Star Wars.  This movie was great and a really fun watch.  Made me feel like a kid again!
WORST. STAR WARS. EVER.
"Having watched the entire SW saga, this one is my favorite! TLJ has a distinct form of storytelling and cinematography compared to the others that I absolutely love. It brought Mark Hamill's acting abilities to a new level. I absolutely adore this movie's complex and powerful Luke. Both Luke Skywalker and Ben Solo delivered impressive character depth and development that made me love their characters when neither was of interest to me before. However, the true star of this movie was the Force itself, we got to learn a lot of what it was and what it can do. My only issue with this film is the actress who played Rose; she was neither good nor bad, her bland and angry incorporation of Rose was subpar at best. Nevertheless, RJ created a beautiful and memorable movie filled with many other intriguing new characters, without depending on SW fan nostalgia. He did well expanding on the concept of the Gray Side, rather than focus on Light vs Dark Side. Not to mention, all the fight and action scenes are truly phenomenal! It is a shame that RJ wasn't in charge of last episode. I wanted to see his vision for episode IX that reflects and develops what happened in episode VIII."
"Pouco reconhecido, esse filme é um espetáculo visual e emocionalmente deslumbrante que explora e evolui os personagens desta saga, possui significados de crescimento e evolução em todas as suas cenas, explora este universo incrível, e, o mais importante de todos, olha para o futuro!"
"This is a great example of how not to do a second act in a trilogy. It is also a cautionary tale against capriciously attempting to subvert audience expectations. I would rather that the director/writer would have subverted audience expectations by making the plot a rom-com than by having taken the route he took with this comedy of errors: it subverted my expectations by not being in the spirit of Star Wars, and that is not a commendable accomplishment. No movie has ever drawn my ire to the degree that this dumpster fire did."
Star Wars died... and this movie killed.
"By far the most incoherent and unnecessary star wars film every produced, filled with unnecessary political jabs that serve no purpose."
"I utterly LOVED it. I have never seen another film that carries so much meaning, so much emotional depth, foreshadowing, rich character arcs and development and something that challenges and questions your ideals and indeed the very ideals of Star Wars while remaining true to the mythology that drives the universe at the core in every single frame. Gorgeous film."
What a way to ruin star wars.
Awful. Worst movie of the  entire franchise.
"Intelligent, provoking, and above all else refreshing, the Last Jedi expects highly of its mature viewers in challenging what we know, while brilliantly expanding on the arcs of Rey and Kylo"
Easily the best Star Wars movie since the OT. A story that challenges characters while being a visual feast. The ending of the movie is a love letter to old school Star Wars fans looking up to and being inspired by the legends of the heroes of this franchise.
Horrible movie with no plot development. The whole Finn and Rose plot was so unnecessary and so forced all I could do was cringe. I was expecting Snoke to be a bigger character than he was but NOPE. Wasted character in a matter of minutes.
Masterpiece. Presses all the right buttons the series needed after slumbering for too long. People will look back at this in the future as absolute masterpiece.
"I wish I could go lower than .5 stars.. what was the point of this film.. zero storyline, nothing unique or new to the plot.. constantly frustrated throughout the entire film."
"Gonna go down as the last great Star Wars film, marred mostly be scam Youtubers begging for clicks. I know most will say ""It's not flawless..."" but forget that. If people want to give it 1 Star for treating Luke like a human being instead of some EU god who could use the dark and lightside of the force at will, I don't need to bother explaining. For certain the throne room scene is the greatest in the entire Star Wars saga."
Critics obviously didn't watch the same movie I saw.
Really took a dump on the fans. Destroyed Luke's character then killed him off. Finn and rose on some random side quest that really did nothing for the main story line something out of a video game side quest for extra xp.
"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an undervalued and underappreciated gem in the Star Wars saga. It's very clear from audience reviews that many people aren't very good at allowing their beloved franchise to go in the direction that its creators want, instead clinging to their own ideas of what Star Wars is, creating impossible expectations that can never bet met and an outcry which as we saw from The Rise of Skywalker, leads to stagnation and the directors not trying anything new. Giving us lacklustre and hollow movies.

Make no mistake about it. The Last Jedi is a fantastic movie. Both as a Star Wars movie and as an individual piece of science fiction. One just needs to allow the story to unfold and let the events on screen  unfold before their eyes and leave their expectations and predetermined notions of what Star Wars is at the door."
Terrible movie with SOME great moments. Glad they fixed everything in The Rise Of Skywalker.
"The penultimate movie of the long standing Skywalker saga delivers. A visually stunning film that bridges the gap between the epic Force Awakens and the inevitable ending of the Skywalker saga with Episode 9. Showcasing how conflicted each character is by not only their surroundings and the ongoing war but also with inner demons and uncertainty. The return of Luke Skywalker showcases a very different version of the character then we are expecting or even used to. Watching Mark Hamill portray a man who is disillusioned with his teachings and his religion was a little jarring but allowed for the ending and for Rey's emergence to mean more. This was a roller coaster ride of emotion and action, culminating in a fantastic pair of lightsaber battles (the fight in Snoak's chambers & Kylo Ren vs Luke Skywalker ghost). Definite recommend for any Star Wars enthusiast and even for casual fans."
"As a huge Star Wars fan, this movie reminded me of seeing A New Hope for the first time. Adventurous, beautifully shot, intense reflections, inspiring story. Couldn't wait to see the next chapter!"
Possibly one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.
"Wow... ""subverted expectations"" in a really really really bad way.  Thanks for destroying Star Wars Disney."
Unwatchable...really
"Didn't like second act, the Cassino , Finn's arc."
"Meaningless arcs, poor written characters and politics filled."
"This movie makes some unconventional choices, but ultimately brings new ideas and strengthens the characters so much. In The Force Awakens, Rey is lost and tries to find her place. Rian Johnson takes that and makes it the core of the character. She is actually no one. She won't get any help, she needs to define who she is on her own. Couldn't get more emotionally resonant than that. I'm thankful for this movie, especially after watching episode IX."
"This movie was so bad that I haven't gone to see another Disney Star Wars movie since...

...and I went to see The Phantom Menace in 3D years after it came out."
"Maybe it looks good, but the Last Jedi has an extremely incompetent script, with Rian Johnson flexing on us with his ""clever"" subversion of expectations rather than giving us an actual good story that has the greater good of the franchise in mind."
Star Wars: The Last Jeti is easily unlikable because of its half baked jokes and silly unnecessary scenes of Luke Skywalker that even Mark Hamil disliked.
"This is the most complex, best written, visually stunning Star Wars movie."
"Everything wrong in modern film directing. A director being given a product and delivering a result skewed to their own political viewpoints while disregarding the lore, character history, and audience. The movie has become so unbearable to watch that I do not even consider it a Star Wars movie any longer. It is an accident that must be hidden from future generations of fans."
"I really embrace changes, reinterpretations and new ideas, but it's a stupid idea to put them in the middle part of a trilogy. Johnson should have made one of the spin-off-movies and not Episode VIII. Maybe I would even have enjoyed his childish sense of humor or the way he mocks the audience by making everything meaningless or is bringing something totally unrealistic as Star Wars to the point where it's illogical to the max and really forces you to silence even the slowest of your brain cells. Maybe he should write a new Spaceballs-movie. He obviously has the right ideas."
"Meh, Johnson has some fun original ideas, but we want to know what happens with the story that's already been set out. What would fans think if I took the Harry Potter characters and put them in a James Bond style film? It wouldn't really fit."
Se quedó a mitad de camino. Lo mas flojito de la saga. De cualquier manera es imperdible para fans.
"How this movie is so well received by critics is beyond me.  Rian Johnson obviously has no appreciation for what has gone before and wanted to be ""edgy"" and ""different"" and subvert what we had come to know and love from previous Star Wars movies. The characters act in unbelievable ways - including most famously destroying the idol of our childhood, Luke Skywalker. You want to make a point that heroes are fallible? Fine. Make your own movie unrelated to what has gone on before, don't completely derail the narrative arc established by others. Others have pointed out the massive plot holes.  Yes, a certain suspension of disbelief s necessary for a Star Wars movies, but this movie asks us to completely check our common sense at the door and ignore the ""rules"" that have been established in this universe. This is the first Star Wars movie that I watched once and will never watch again. Indeed, I only saw ""The Rise of Skywalker"" because I had heard it rejected much of this movie."
This movie got a bad rap from fanboys who don't want moral ambiguity introduced into their precious canon. It ruled and Rise of Skywalker sucked. Get at me.
Absolutely terrible. Completely ignores major plot points from the previous movie and leaves the next movie with absolutely no direction to go in.
"Não condizente com a saga, comercial, clichê, cenas sem nexo"
A disgrace to all of star wars.
"Ughhh, more politics than episode 1 and not even space politics."
There was no saving grace to this movie. Poor angsty acting.. meandering and boring plot
"This movie is a trash! Ryan Johnson make Star Wars like a stupid clown.
Imagine you give Harry Potter a lightsaber That's what happen with this movie."
"This movie shows the philosophical potential of Hollywood and the Star Wars franchise: The dialogues between the three protaginsts (Kylo Ren, Rey and Luke Skywalker) are thoughtful, displaying different points of view on the same topics. The old quote ""from a certain point of view"" finally makes sense. Rian Johnson's take on the ""Force"" is more than the boring black and white conflict we've seen more than seven times now, as he looks in the gray areas between the extreme positions of the Jedi and the Sith. The characters in this story have small, but believable arcs, which is a nice contrast to the poetic and nearly surreal action scenes. Of course there are space battles and lightsaber duels, but they never felt so magical and powerful before. Compared to the previous Episode VII this movie offers simple, but in second thought meaningful answers to the questions of lineage, power and motivations of the antagonists. 
A downside is the enormous length due to a large subplot and several plot twists. Some new characters might not meet everyone's tastes, but they are designed to be unsympathetic on purpose. Except for Luke Skywalker, the focus of the movie is totally on the new characters, which could disappoint some hardcore fans of the original movies."
Terrible movie!!! Don't watch if you're a fan of star wars. It will ruin starwars as it did for me!
"It had very mature undertones most childish SW fans would not understand, but it was a beautiful plot."
The best studio blockbuster of the 2010s
Didn't answer any of the questions set up by the first film felt like they wanted to tell their own story and not build off the previous film. a lot of political gesturing in the movie too which sucks. overall I didn't like it
"I am a Star Wars Fan and saw it twice in cinema I fell asleep both times during the Luke trains Rey scenes, even tough I loved Luke as a character. To this day I didn't watch my copy of the film I pre-ordered. No matter how it was made as a film. It's not Star Wars. You can only like it, if you don't care or know about Star Wars."
"I think future generations will be much more gracious towards this film than fans were immediately after its release. I've watched the whole sequel trilogy three times now and this is the only one that gets better every time I watch it. I'll admit... after watching ""The Last Jedi"" for the first time, I was conflicted. It didn't feel ""Star Wars-y"" enough for me. But now, after having just watched ""The Rise of Skywalker"" for the third time, I'm convinced that ""The Last Jedi"" is far and away the best film in the sequel trilogy."
"It would have been 4 stars if it was a stand alone film, but the director didn't seem to care that he was directing the second part of a trilogy. Only after seeing The Rise of Skywalker can you realize how Disney's lack of planning damaged this ""trilogy"""
"It reminded me more of a shallow sitcom than of the actual great epic that starwars is.
Completely broken of immersiveness, and a very shallow cast"
"There's a lot to like about this movie, and a lot to dislike. I felt like it pandered pretty hard, and made some promises it couldn't keep. It also failed to set up a great villain, which put episode 9 in a bad spot."
"Constant gotcha moments, and total disrespect for both the franchise and the other movies in the trilogy, nearly killed off the Star Wars franchise for me.

At least the visuals are well done. So it has that going for it I guess."
The terrible attempt at humor and the character assassination of Luke Skywalker make this movie nearly unwatchable!
By far the WORST Star Wars movie I have ever seen. It was so horrible I refused to pay for and watch the 3rd and final movie of the latest trilogy. I'm sorry but Disney has officially destroyed this series for me and it will take a miracle to get me to watch another movie!
boring and lacks internal cohesion. At least there is a script which is more than what can be said for the previous film.
"The only positive I can say about this movie are its visuals, but there lies also a big problem with the writing. A lot of style over substance so to say.
It seems like they've tried to keep the audience in aw, to gloss over a lackluster script, filled with way to many plotholes, unnecessary sciences & plotlines, and unbelievably overstuffed with Bathos. 
The script seems desperate to reverse the audience expectations in every moment, which leaves you with not much but confusion and pretty scenery. 
The handling of the canon is probably the worst I've ever witnessed in a sequel. Established characters are completly rewritten and made fools just for a cheap laugh. It's fine to introduce a new generation, but please leave to story you carry on with a little bit of dignity."
The worst Star Wars movie ever.  Period.  Even worse than the Episode 2.
"There are some cool scenes, but basic logic ruins even the best of them. Major characters are ruined by completely reversing entire character arcs from the previous films. Whole scenes feel forced to provide a social message that isn't organic to the overall story. The ""revolutionary"" message that anyone can be a Jedi is not revolutionary. Decades of Star Wars storytelling have already established that lineage is far from what makes a Jedi. The Prequels already established that Jedi were not found by lineage, but rather their innate talent independent of their heritage. The story beats look great on paper, but are tragically fumbled in execution. It's a fun watch, but far too reminiscent of the Prequel Trilogy's worst moments."
WTF was Disney thinking???
Worst in the whole skywalker saga and yes the phantom menace is a good movie
"Risky, with questionable decisions, a little original plot, poorly made twists and a lazy script makes The Last Jedi divide the fans and be several steps less for this new trilogy ."
"I don't know what they were thinking when doing this movie, even Episode I is better"
"A no plot film.  You can actually got from Force Awakens straight to Rise of Skywalker and not miss any information - at all. Insulting way to handle Luke's moments, absolutely slapping the audience with any love for the original trilogy.  Don't ruin Star Wars for yourself and skip this non-logical, rule breaking waste of time."
Dude this movie is everything
Really didn't make a lot of sense. Jumbled and messy plot lines.
"well, that movie is a almost complete failure :c"
At least the plot is not a rip off of the other movies. Still a mess full of plot holes and unexplained actions and characters.
After all the critics it's one of the best Staelr Wars movie!
Least favorite sw film. Ruins the ST in my opinion.
"Unlike many, I enjoyed the fresh take on a four decade old saga. Often I find fans too bogged down by Star Wars tradition. In my eyes, the best things have always been something original and new. This is my favorite Star Wars movie by far. I was on my edge of my seat from the moment I saw that iconic blue text up on the screen. 9.5/10"
"A stronger standalone film than most, and willing to take risks, which is refreshing, but far too much soapbox at times."
"Absolute rubbish. Director should find a new career, as clearly this was a wrong choice."
Absolutely crap. Totally pointless movie don't bother
"The Last Jedi is a movie that critics loved because they thought it did somethings different than other Star Wars movies. While there are some things that are different, what it really does at the heart of the movie is take most critical locales and events in Empire Strikes Back as well as a few from Return of the Jedi and either mimic or subvert the decision or outcome. Crait is Hoth, but salt not snow. Rebels being chased by an Empire are replaced by Resistance chased by First Order. Benicio Del Toro's hacker character helps then betrays, while Lando betrays then helps. Rey trains as a Jedi with a reluctant master while Luke trained with a patiently waiting one. Rey rushes off from her training to confront Kylo Ren like Luke rushed off to confront Vader. Rey lifts stones and Luke lifted stones. Vader to Luke: ""No, I'm your father."" Kylo to Rey, 'your father is nobody.' Luke is the Jedi's last hope in Empire and Rey is the Jedi's last hope in Last Jedi. Luke enters the abandoned Rebel base on Crait similar to his entrance in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine in Return. Kylo presents Rey to Snoke similar to how Vader presented Luke to Emperor in Return. Rey watches the fleet battle from the throne room as Luke watched the fleet battle from the throne room in Return. You can call it new, or you can say a lot of it was mostly Empire flipped on its head. ""Force FaceTime"" between Rey and Kylo is interesting but eventually annoying. Some Sci-Fi fans believe the plot of the Resistance fleet is borrowed and adapted from the remade Battlestar Galactica series, and they might be right. Battlestar also had a casino planet which was more interesting and engaging than Canto Bight. The Last Jedi doesn't even try to be subtle with its messaging, with words that ring from screen to reality like ""kill the past."" A nod to both letting go of nostalgia and resentment in the fanbase and the old stars as well as the expectations that come with a 40+ year old franchise. But getting hit over the head with the ""spark that lights the fire"" notion so many times leaves audiences to think the writers and director don't entrust them with these critical themes. Also, preaching about the gray areas of war when the series is literally about war while freeing animals but not children dances around the issues and seems a little hypocritical. The ""Holdo Maneuver"" was well shot but begs the question why the series doesn't use projectiles fired at light speeds as a weapon more often (or why a droid couldn't have piloted the ship instead of Holdo). Why does Holdo withhold information from Poe but then commend him when speaking to Leia? A lot of plot doesn't quite make sense, and a lot of character development is thrown out. In fact, Last Jedi ditches most of the setup that Force Awakens laid down in order to go its own direction. For continuity of fans, that's dis-jarring. All in all it's an ok movie with a few cool scenes (throne room battle) but I'll take Empire and Return over this one every time."
Don’t understand the hate. This has everything I want out of Star Wars.
terribly convoluted dribble
The movie dwells more with the spiritual side of the force and strips back the action. It is not bad by anymeans. It is different but I honestly feel it is a much needed star wars movie.
"Pretty standard sci fi film. It was disappointing to see Abrams ideas go unanswered or be completely thrown away. But despite that we are still left with a pretty good film. The cast is great and excels better here than in The Force Awakens if I'm being honest. The bad parts involve the casino scenes, or the parts revolving the animals. They were dragged out and really halted the flow of the film overall. I thought Luke's storyline was good and Rey worked well with him, the ending with him was sorta a waste but it's fine. Kyle Ren is still an inadequate ""villain"" and is void of any real personality. Snoke is wasted, but his battle scene in the red room with Rey and Kylo was phenomenal and showed a section of how amazing film could have been."
Why does this get 91 rotten tomatoes but joker gets 69?
"Solid Star Wars film with the heart of a Star Wars fan, front and center"
This movie was not good what they did with Luke skywalker was horrible and made a bad taste for the beloved character and the rest of the movie was barley ok although Kylo Ren was the best part of the movie
Decent move with some kinda dumb parts
Ghastly. Should be called the Last Mary Sue. Turns every character you loved from the original into a clumsy incompetent fool to be outshown by a zany teen lead.
This movie makes The Phantom Menace looking good in comparsion.
An insult to Star Wars and its legacy.
"I enjoyed the grittier tone and Luke Skywalker's story arc. Not so much the daftness of Mary Poppins in space and the pointless trip to Harry Potter world. Trouble is, the chase in space part feels more like a drawn out TV episode than a film."
Worst of the Star Wars movies. Actors worked with what the director gave them. Absolutely nothing.
This film is amazing. The Last Jedi elevates this franchise to a higher level.
For a sci-fi movie it’s okay but it sucks as a Star Wars movie. It was like Rian Johnson saw all the previous Star Wars movies and decided he just wanted to watch them all burn.
Is a good reboot of the franchise.  Explain the context and give to the new characters some identity to expand the SW universe.
"If this were the first act to the trilogy, it would have been really interesting.  The problem is it isn't, its the second act. And rather than expanding on the plot from The Force Awakens or answer some of the questions we had, a lot of the build-ups are completely abandoned with new ones being created in its place. therefore, as a second act, it fails to act as a smooth transition to the final film. So in the end what we have plotwise is a second act that goes nowhere. This is why The Rise of Skywalker had to do The Last Jedi's job in the opening 3rd of the film.  And that is really unfortunate because The Rise of Skywalker is a good movie and would have been even better if it had a competent second act.

With that said, however, I did enjoy certain aspects of The Last Jedi. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the effects department have done a fabulous job mixing practical and digital effects to create an inhabitable world that is believable to the viewer.  I also enjoyed the performances, yes even the new characters were likable and enjoyable to watch, especially Poe.  But overall what we have is an ineffective second act which really drags down the rating, which is why I can't give it any higher than a 3/5."
"A great film, that only sufffers a bit from the way that humor is pushed on the audience. There is also a particular scene in the film that shows a lack of understanding of an integral concept created by Lucas. This film uses misdirection to toy with the expectations of longtime fans, which will get mixed reviews for sure, but in the era of Game of Thrones, that felt fun and gave an element of surprise to this film. All in all, a much better movie that its predecessor which is a tired rewrite of a New Hope with a female lead."
"An interesting new direction that tries to redefine the Star Wars franchise to meet a modern audience and allow room for growth. It blends fun action with some greater meaning themes. But be warned, this is not your fathers Star Wars."
Rian Johnson's complete departure from the plot lines and character development of the previous seven Star Wars movies served to utterly destroy the Star Wars franchise.
"Just a quick note on this film. I'm not primarily a Star Wars fan although I do enjoy the story of the Star Wars saga. When I first read and heard fan reviews of the film I thought that it must be a piece of crap and avoided it. It took 2 years, but I finally watched it so when I see The Rise of Skywalker I will have the complete story. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. 
Yes, some of the scenes were a bit campy and cheesy, but the action, heart and Star Wars atmosphere were all there, and it felt like a strong middle entry for the final trilogy. Aside from die hard Star Wars fans (which haven't liked any Star Wars film since The Return of the Jedi), I don't see the negativity from audiences. I don't understand it. The movie was action packed, with excellent visuals, typically amazing music score and the typical campy Star Wars comedy that made The Last Jedi a fun experience. I'm actually excited to see how the saga ends. This film was excellent."
Proof that critics have no idea what they are talking about
Incredibly slow first half and questionable narrative direction led to an unsatisfying experience.
"Awful, awful movie. Johnson destroyed character arcs and did nothing to move the plot forward while making the first order ridiculous with cheesy humor. It ruined a lot of fans love for Star Wars and lost the interest of average movie goers. The Force Awakens earned 2 billion, The Last Jedi 1.3 billion and Rise will earn less because of this movie. Rian Johnson lost Disney BILLIONS of dollars and he is praised for it by critics and Disney. Blows my mind...."
"Glossy headache inducing garbage. It was like watching a best friend you looked up to, admired, idolised get burned at the stake."
shame how far this series has fallen
Probably my least favourite Star Wars movie feature with it's 'subverting expectations'.
"Worst crap i have ever seen. Period.

Too bad i couldn't give 0 stars"
"Fun movie; with some controversial but brave decisions.
The movie risked new ideas, and that's definitely a positive thing."
"Ruined everything the previous movies had built. Fight scenes were ridiculously horribly choreographed, answers all of the questions that trailers arose in an unsatisfying manner, gave undeserving characters too much power way to quickly, and like captain marvel, took a shit on everything that built it up for a lousy joke that no one remembered after the film. Honestly disgusting."
The only one of the new trilogy that dared do anything different to the original trilogy. It's a shame that JJ Abrams went and undid it all in Episode 9.
"Rian Johnson delivers on the most ambitious Star Wars film to-date.  Bold, smart, rich with story and character depth, Johnson understands the heart of Star Wars goes beyond its superficial iconography.  While a tad overlong and a bit messy at times (though never sloppy), The Last Jedi hits where it counts, and features some of the best material this franchise has seen since The Empire Strikes Back."
"I wish I could give 0 stars!

This movie is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made, it is an insult to the greatest intellectual property in the world, it gives the characters created by George Lucas and the fans a big fat middle finger while spitting in our face.

First things first, the character of Luke Skywalker was totally mishandled to the point that Mark Hamill voices his concerns to Ryan Johnson while being ignored. The Luke Skywalker of The Last Jedi (if we can even call him that) is totally out of character.

Admiral Holdo withholding information from the rest of the crew was totally unnecessary and was nothing more but lazy writing created to force drama and create a subplot that acted only as a filler in the story. 

The Holdo maneuver creates a giant plot hole for the hole saga, if destroying a major target by having a small ship jumper into hyperspace and then crashing with said target is possible in Star Wars, the why did the rebellion bother to fly the trench run and fire the proton torpedos into a small exhaust port, when they could have simply have an X-Wing piloted by droid jump into hyperspace while slicing the Death Star in half?when you create a fictional story you have the liberty to create your own rules for said story, even your own laws of physics, it is important for you to obey the rules of the story with which you're working.

Canto Bight is well... let's just say that if you need a bathroom break, now is the time to go (although you may enjoy your bathroom break a lot more than the whole movie). Totally irrelevant to the plot.

The list goes on and on. Ryan Johnson succeeded in subverting our expectations. We expected a decent Star Wars movie, but instead we got a plate full of hot steamy excrement. He was so obsessed in being subverting that he forgot that he was trying to make a good story. Thankfully the Rise Of Skywalker retconned so many of the insults done by The Last Jedi, that you don't need to watch the Last Jedi. You can go staring from episode VII to IX."
"No one's ever really gone... Rey's journey continues and the Skywalker saga concludes in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

There's nostalgia bait and references to past movies and other established cannon, just a step away from the ""wink wink, nudge nudge. Did you see what we did there?"" type of references. The visuals are amazing and the spectacle is just as amazing. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver give their best performances of the series. The music is even more amazing courteous of John Williams which greatly enhances the movie and highlights how important a soundtrack is for a movie.

The Rise of Skywalker rarely comes close to touching greatness. The film tries to fit in so much it threatens to tear apart at the seams, but ultimately rises to the impossible occasion to complete the saga. 7.5/10

"Up until The Last Jedi there was always something I liked about a Star Wars movie even if I didn't like the movie as a whole.  I didn't like Phantom Menace but I did like young Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon,  Darth Maul, and so much more.  But The Last Jedi didn't have anything I liked.  Luke was a pathetic hermit, Rose and Finn went on some useless quest, Leia can fly like Mary Poppins, there are horrible jokes and the Holdo maneuver makes one wonder why it wasn't used all the time in space warfare.  I know the director wanted to subvert expectations and that is okay if you have a stand alone movie, but it doesn't work very well in a trilogy."
"Hot trash, seems like the director had his own agenda making this feel out of place for a trilogy movie"
"The worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I don´t care about nnothing on the new characters, they don´t have charisma and the director killed the true purpose of Luke Skywalker, who in the original saga, he was couraged and positive... in this movie he is reduced to be a coward and all the things that he did in the past seems to have no sense. This movie killed my intention to see episode 9 and I cannot care less from the characters of Rey, Finn, and Poe."
"The new lead character of this generation of Star Wars movies is really badly thought out. It has 0 defects, 0 hardships to overcome, perfect at everything. In comparison, the original trilogy was about learning how to lose, to improve, to thrive in the face of adversity. This movie was just Rey smashing through everything with ease, with almost no training, being able to go toe to toe with and even beating characters that devoted their entire life, starting from childhood, to fighting. That is bad writing, and keeps nobody glued to their screen, it's like a Superman movie where there is no kryptonite, no enemy kryptionians or any powerful aliens, just Superman versus regular humans."
"They kill my childhood with this movie, they pretend to make more movies of this universe, taking the last cent from it just to create merchandise"
Plot is terrible and they did the original characters wrong.
The worlds longest space chase. This movie is what happens when you fail to map out the direction you're going to take with a trilogy. If you remove Luke committing force suicide (or w/e the eff that was)  this movie would feel more like a fan film of what could have happened between episode VII and VIII. Instead we get this trash pile that doesn't really serve to advance the trilogy's story line.  Which furthermore paints the direction of the trilogy into a rushed corner for Episode IX.
"The list of problems with this movie is a mile long.  Rian Johnson should stay out of star wars.  His understanding of the star wars universe is poor, and his decision to use it to push his personal views on a variety of subjects outside the scope of this type of movie is infuriating."
Horrible in every aspect
2nd best Star Wars film. Only lower than Empire in my opinion. JJ Abrams and Disney's retconning of this film in Rise of Skywalker is a huge disappointment.
"Pointless, generic sf movie with no Star Wars tone, it could have been easily the second installment after Spaceballs of a parody saga..."
"Loved it. Gutsy filmmaking, compelling performances and exciting visuals. Exactly what you want in a Star Wars film. The chemistry between Ridley and Driver is one of the best parts of the movie. So many people hate this film because it takes risks and diverges from Star Wars tradition, but that is why I love it so much. It pays homage to what has come before whilst forging its own identity."
This movie abused of the deus ex machina. For me the worst starwars movie.
"I am very split about this movie. When I first watched it I really did not like it, and upon rewatching it I could better appreciate what it tried to do, but in my opinion it ultimately failed at what it set out to achieve. I still respect what was attempted, but I probably will not be revisiting this movie again."
"I don't care what anyone else says, this was my favorite one."
"Fresh ideal and new story arcs, although it lacks a little bit the oldschool adventure feeling."
We needed J.J for the director
“Let’s make the answer to every question the worst answer possible and call it subversion.”
A rollicking good yarn!
Super bad and boring. Worst Star Wars movie ever. It ruins a lot of great characters such as Luke Skywalker
"It's objective/moral is failure so the movie is objectively bad. Why? Rey's goal was to be trained she did, Resistance's goal escape the first order they did, and finally Finn and Roses goal get plans or something I never watched that part after seeing the movie in theaters but they won kind of. Now my opinion is 79% hate, 12% bored, 5% liked it, and 4% felt nothing but disappointment. The Canto Bite scene I get bored out of my mind, Luke's death I would like it if 1 I knew how he died he didn't have a obvious cause at least none that was already established in canon, 2 how his character was written if you think this movie is a masterpiece you are probably saying ""But it subverted expectations!"" Okay let me get this clear you think subverting expectations = AMAZING!!... it doesn't also quick side note how come the bombers are so slow there were bombers in previous lore that are better yet obsolete! However those bombers aren't what I think is wrong with the dreadnought scene the fact the bombs didn't just float like things do in a vacuum of space now some people have said well gravity of the ships or magnets first the gravity defense and why it makes no sense 1 if the ships gravity thing worked the bombers would be pulling the bombs away from the dreadnought and back towards the bombers because of the distance 2   the bombs wouldn't even leave the ship due to them being an inch from the sides of the bomber so the gravity strength is stronger due to mass of objects and distance. The second defense magnets this I believe was in a book but even then Rian needed an outside source to fill in the gaps of his own movie as well as supporters to come up with reasons that haven't been officially made unlike the graphic dictionary books that are canon that is bad story telling! P.S someone with a small script was telling Hux something and one of the only lines that character had summed up the whole plot but then Rian thinking subverting expectations = good started making things that made that simple plot unbelievably incoherent!"
"The force bond between Kylo and Rey is so interesting, but Rose is not. Poor Kelly Marie Tran - it's not her fault."
"Terrible, just terrible"
"While I definitely enjoyed The Last Jedi more on my second viewing, a handful of truly awful moments overshadowed the rest of a beautiful, cohesive plot. Hated when Leia (Carrie Fisher) floated through the atmosphere just as much as the first time, the telepathy shtick seemed to come out of nowhere, and the lack of urgency between Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn (John Boyega) DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ENEMY LINES was painful. A head-scratching moment was how Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and Leia spoke affectionately of Poe (Oscar Isaac) who, only moments earlier, committed an ultimately unsuccessful mutiny onboard the ship. Lastly, it would've made way more sense for Kylo to order the 100,000 laser barrage on Luke Skywalker AFTER engaging him in hand-to-hand combat. However, I still raised my ranking a solid 13 points because I appreciated the storyline as whole much more than on my first viewing, the visual beauty throughout — the lightspeed suicide, the showdown on Crait — and the handful of final scenes, which I think helped build anticipation for The Rise of Skywalker."
"The movie that may have ruined Star Wars forever...  This movie plays out like a bad dream. I was a big fan of Rian Johnson's Looper, but keep him as far away from the Star Wars franchise as possible."
Movie in sense of complexity is good and bit better then Force Awakens.It is good  but its not typical Star Wars movie.It destroys completly view on previous way characters were introduced and loved by fans.It has agenda on putting many characters that brings nothing in the movie.Ryan Johnson seem to not listen to fans of movie frenchise at all rather picture story of company and not his own.Its good movie for one time to see.
Absolute trash with no respect toward fans of SW
The worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen.
An absolute TRAVESTY of a movie. The film That destroyed the saga
It disgraced the story of the loved character luke skywalker. it was a horrible script. luke deserved better.
"A bit of a chore to sit through a second time (I thought I reviewed this already? Hmm? Maybe not). Anyways, after Laura Dern, it's a boring snoozefest, but it does actually pick up towards the end."
"The film subverted my expectations for a well thought out film, that made sense in the Star Wars universe. What we got was a confusing film that damaged the story-line of the films that preceded it, and tarnished saga's legacy."
"Like watching a dog take a shit, No one want's to see that."
The worst possible movie that could have ever been made for the Star Wars franchise. Practically unwatchable.
"Disney continue to ruin a saga. SW TLJ ifs a joke, it's a movie full if jokes, with no depth, no real story, no consistency in the  military actions (we reach the ridiculous), people die stupidly and try to save others stupidly. It's a horrible joke."
"Terrible movie, don't waste your time."
"TLJ is one of the worst Star Wars film. All parts of this movie felt forced and created to make the story, IE Luke ""attempting"" to kill Ben Solo when he was younger because he may be evil. Like redeemed Darth Vader, who has killed many people and Jedi, no way Luke Attempts to kill Kylo.

The while side plot with rose and Finn was a waste of time and did nothing for the story. Leia uses the force to save herself from space, when she's never trained (on screen before). 

Snoke was killed very easily, but with no direction, how do you expect Kylo to be supreme leader? He can barely keep up with an untrained Rey.

The positives were the battle in the throne room and the battle between Luke and Kylo on the salt plains. Then we come to realize Luke cowered on his planet and then dies. Waste of an actor and plot. 

Overall, this movie is not very good."
The Critics were on drugs when they reviewed this steaming pile of crap.
This film is a horrendous insult to the Star Wars saga. It's Rian Johnson's attempt to obliterate what fans love about Star Wars so that he can try to impress movie critics.
Laughably bad. Every moment is a travesty to the art of story telling
It was worst than Plan 9 from outer space
"Loved the movie with one exception... the storyline of Finn and Rose had a weird and very long sequence, which it didn't really need. But I loved the bold choices Johnson made for some characters."
This was a good movie. It was super fun and funny and epic. There really isn't much more I look for from a Star Wars movie! My only real critique is I wish they'd had more guts to actually kill characters.
"Terrible movie, an abomination to the legacy and disrespect to the fanbase. The only bad Star Wars movie"
"The movie is the worst ever. No backsroyes ,, no nothing , go watch the prequels, they are better"
"The Last Jedi does exactly what the immediate predecessors do, provide nothing but Star Wars nostalgia than everything else in a movie"
"Absolute disgrace and disappointing. A disgrace to Star Wars with some interesting ideas but no proper cohesion. Rose is awful, the captain is awful, Ackbar deserved better, the casino plot was a stupid waste of time, and the main lead is a Mary Sue."
"I couldn't get into the movie. From the very first scenes, seeing General Hux, who supposedly is the leader of the first order act as a three years old took me out and I couldn't get back in. For me Star Wars is first and foremost a cohesive universe, and this movie just threw it out the window."
"The worst star wars ever made, until the 9th come out. Poor writing and really bad storyline. All the great and nasty mood of the saga are here killed by Disney."
"The worst SW ever. Too long, too boring, way too many cute animals that will become merchandise (even for a SW movie), nothing really happens for two hours, giant plot holes, lasers going down because of gravity, fuel restrictions, Leila comes back from space, admiral Ackbar dies and no one cares... but hey, the light-speed jump that destroys the dreadnought is awesome! Btw, why they did't destroy all death stars in that way? Why is it necessary to build a death star when you can light speed a cargo into a planet?"
"I have always been a fan of Last Jedi, but as I watch it again it continues to amaze me. If you want a Star Wars film that is just battles and fire fights then maybe this isn't for you, but if you really want to dive into Star Wars and ask yourself bigger questions then yes it is. Questions on the makings of a hero, redemption, the cost of war, how the actions of the Jedi and Skywalkers affect the rest of the galaxy. We learn that the Star Wars galaxy is so much larger than we once thought. That even Jedi have moments of lapsed judgement. That those lapses have consequences and that a true hero although the moral journey is bumpy always does the right thing. Last Jedi is the story of failure, we all have experienced it and to think these characters have not is be blind to the worlds truths. Ignore the internet trolls and see this film. Then think of how far Star Wars can expand now that its been made."
"The script, the characters and everything."
"Really bad writing and pretty CGI... That's the movie, folks."
"It ruined Star Wars. Nothing in the movie felt right. Editing, sound design, and cinematography were decent though."
"Good production but an unprofessionally visionless story with poor quality jokes. Writers of this movie had no idea about Star Wars, unless it was their intent to make millions of people quit this franchise."
"I just watched for the second time... This one didn't aged very well... The plot is ambicious but badly executed, lots of plot holes..."
Absolute garbage movie! Keep Rian far away from Star wars! Watch robot head on YouTube he can explain why this movie sucks! TL;DR
Two words Leila Poppins
"This is by far the best Disney Star Wars movie even after seeing the Rise of Skywalker. All the fans complaining that TLJ is hypocritical or surprising for surprisings sake simply cannot handle the truth that their fictional fan theories were proven wrong. TLJ is a wonder of storytelling that happens to be based on Star Wars. Of course, some parts of the movie like the canto byte sequence have no purpose and ruin the pacing, but on whole, the movie is quite recommendable."
"I love this movie, it is the most original since Empire."
"It gets suffocated in its own plot which feels like one giant improvisation after another, resulting in a pointless movie and even more pointless compared to the other sequel movies, without a doubt the Black Sheep from the Star Wars herd"
"Rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten! Spaceballs was much better."
"So many things that just didn’t need to happend, this movie could have so much better bt it’s just choices that direction that they went with"
By far the worst Star Wars content ever released including the holiday special!!
"Awesome film - easily top two in the SW saga after Empire. Really digs into some philosophy around the Jedi that The Clone Wars and prequels dealt with. Who is right in war? Which is the right side, and who is profiting? When is the right time to step aside or step into the fray?

Also, some of the best fight and light saber battles in the saga.

Ignore the breathless ranting of angry boys who drag their identity politics into the fandom, stinking everything up. And I thought tauntauns smelled bad. 🤣"
Rian Johnsons disregard for established lore and character development brings the movie and unfortunately the whole sequel trilogy to a stand still. Apart from impressive visuals and action scenes this movie this movie offers nothing to the Star Wars canon.
"The failure of Rian Johnson's ""The Last Jedi"" was almost as appalling as seeing the audience/critic divide in scores, and makes me wonder if it isn't entirely politically driven."
"People always assume that the original movie/s in any series will be the best, but not in this case. Star Wars the Last Jedi is definitely one of my favourites. The acting is outstanding and the story gives me chills because it's so amazing. Absolutely loved this movie!"
Very sad when the critics go for something so unrefined/choppy and filled with useless extras with horrible sappy lines.  Needs focus and less glam more heart.
This trash doesn't even deserve half a star the worst star wars film yet a d Rose is worse than Jar Jar Binks
"Full of plotholes and contradictions from previous stories, this is starwars written by and for non starwars fans"
Its a total disgrace. Truly bad. Ew.
Literally just killed a bunch of people and had no effect on the storyline besides disrespecting Luke's character.
Nothing but disappointment with no character development while adding more characters to not develop.
"The side plots muddled the momentum, and Leah's superman was ridiculous."
Wrost Star Wars ever made
"This entire trilogy is nothing more than a money grab by Disney. 

Incoherent mess with no flow."
"Luke Skywalker is the definition of a new hope, he shouldn't be a hermit on an island and he should also see the good in Kyle Ren at the end. They try to make Poe seem like a stupid man after trying to save the entire resistance because he didn't know about a secret plan that nobody would tell him. Finn was about to save everybody and Rose stops him unknowing that Luke and Rey would clean up after her. Also Finn got completely ignored. Plot goes nowhere, the movie starts with them running from the first order and it ends with them running from the first order except this time with like 10 people left in the resistance but they still see it as a victory and a happy ending"
"Worst movie I ever watched in my whole life, just one long piece of shit, ot worth it to watch at all!!!!!!!!"
"This film was the most disappointing film of all time. The first film of the new trilogy was a remake the first films and I enjoyed it, it was not to be taken too seriously and set up the rest of the series. This director then proceeds to do what Luke Skywalker does with the Lightsabre he was handed and throws it away. He then seems to stick two fingers up at the core audience of those who were kids when the first trilogy came out or even kids when the second came out and instead of us finally getting to see Luke Skywalker Jedi Master, we get this grumpy old caricature of god knows who. The whole film is just wrong. I won't spoil what happens, but the franchise ended there and then for me. This was a director who did not know his audience and made a film for others, but they aren't the ones who want to see this rubbish, and they won't be back for the next one."
"I like this movie.  Its a good action movie, but its a poor Star Wars movie.  I rank it as 8 out of the 11 movies.  Not horrible but does nothing to advance the world."
An awe full film using cheap jokes to get people to laugh whilst they waste 2 hours of their life.
Bad don't buy it wasn't good
"The most innovative Star Wars movie I've ever seen. This film has things to say, and although it has many flaws it's still fun to watch."
"This is my favorite Star Wars movie by far. I really loved the story, it was very surprising and thrilling!"
"Despite having some flaws within the story, The Last Jedi succeeds to show a new direction for the franchise with director Rian Johnson interrogating the values and virtues that made the original trilogy a classic. This may be the most controversial Star Wars movie out there, but also the most needed for future movies."
"Rewatched 12/29/19.

Kyle Ren is the millennial bad guy ever."
"It’s amazing, I love this movie and no one can tell me otherwise, I can see some of the mistakes made and why people complain! But it still is so awesome and has some of the best scenes in all the saga, don’t listen to the negative reviews!"
"After seeing Rise of Skywalker, it was even more obvious how absolutely terrible The Last Jedi was ....
The Last Jedi was terrible because it didn't draw you into the story, so the horrible plot holes and science mistakes were just sooooo blatant and painful.   Gravity Bombs, phone pranks, etc in just the first few minutes set the bad tone, and it only got worse.
You can just skip this one in the series ... Episode 7 feeds into Episode 9 just fine, and you just ignore Episode 8 completely."
"This movie is a travesty because Rian Johnson was so tickled by his own perception of his self-perceived cleverness and drive to ""subvert expectations"" for no reason other than just to do it, that he forgot that he was creating the 8th movie in a 40 year old saga, rather than doing his own one-off movie.

Johnson begins the movie by unnecessarily breaking a key component of the Star Wars universe (that unless there's a tracking beacon, jumping to lightspeed cannot be tracked) for no other reason than to drive a boring and stupid plot. His grand idea? Let's have a slow motion space chase that lasts for almost the entire movie... That will be fun for people to watch.

The way to turn off this new technology must be procured from a useless side quest with Rose and Finn which ultimately could and should be excised from the movie without impacting the rest of the story line.

Johnson's introduced Rose Tico to give Finn some one to go on this side quest with. While I think Kelly Marie Tran does fine in terms of acting the material she was given - the material is the problem. There's no real reason to add this character.

Likewise, and twice as egregious is Admiral Holdo. Playing a part that should have been carried out by Admiral Ackbar, but wasn't... For reasons?... Holdo's character refuses to share vital information the entire run of the movie just to serve plot points rather than for any discernable motivation for her character. Her final, again Star-Wars-world-breaking-for-no-purpose-other-than-a-""cool""-shot manuveur only serves as a capstone to Rian's laziness and lack of story-telling finesse.

As for Luke Skywalker... Rian Johnson's Luke Skywalker is not Luke Skywalker. When Mark Hamill says to you, ""I disagree with every decision you've made for this character,"" and you're too filled with hubris to take a step back and question whether you're on the right track, nothing good will follow. Without getting in to spoilers, on the outside chance anyone is reading this without having seen the movie, Johnson ignores the entire thread of character development in the original trilogy and disregards the core driving force of Luke's belief system - that ANYONE, even his world-killing, child-slaughtering, wife-murdering father can be brought back to the light - in service of his lame plot.

So, in summary, we have a world-breaking and simultaneously boring main plot, a new character who only exists to keep the plot on the nonsensical tracks Rian set out, a side plot that advances nothing for the story, and a total disregard for arguably the most beloved character in the franchise - all leading up to a lazy repeat of the Hoth battle that makes even less sense.

I have never left a Star Wars movie so angry as I left this one, and rank it as worse than all others, prequels included. You're better off reading the synopsis and skipping over this one to go straight to the course correction that is The Rise of Skywalker."
Missed opportunity with this one. The casino planet plotline alone makes this one a film I do not want to rewatch...
"a complete garbage, ""professional"" critics stink"
Best of the Disney Star Wars movies by far.
One Word: Disappointing >:(
Worst Star Wars anything ever made.  This makes the prequels look fantastic by comparison.  Prior to this movie I saw every single Star Wars movie in the theater at least twice.  After this movie I haven't seen a single Star Wars movie in a theater.  I was going to go see Rise of Skywalker but re-watched all movies (in timeline order) before it came out and re-watching Last Jedi killed my enthuasm again.  Rian Johnson should never have been allowed to make this disaster of a movie and better never be allowed near any Star Wars produciton in the future.
Incredible way to delve into the characters of the saga and see beyond the light and the dark into a gray area. Strong story risks taken but each one pays off. This story combined with the other cinematic components keep you invested throughout. A new theme for an old franchise.
"Not perfect, but Johnson takes the reigns on the second entry of the new Star Wars trilogy and fulfills so much. His story is the most clear and original and every character gets great arcs.

Most importantly this entry into the franchise has some of the best fight scenes ever to grace the screens in the Star Wars Cinematic Universe. It gives fans everything a Star Wars movie should have including new planets, new and interesting characters, and delightful direction. 

Despite what others may say about this film it is simply the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back and that's period."
"actually the worst star wars film unbelievable (in the universe of star wars) things happening left and right, characters changing their entire moral compass shallow use of new characters while shoehorning others just to ruin basic fundamentals of star wars itself (bombers moving slowly to drop bombs in space? unshielded ships, making villains into a joke (hux) having luke drink blue milk and toss is lightsaber and have such unbelievable personality changes. 
To put it simply the reason the new trilogy hasn't done so well , The last jedi."
"""Social Justice Wars, this has become....now, matters are worse.""
~Master Yoda"
"The Last Jedi tries too hard to be a top tier and unique film, and i's painfully obvious. For a middle act of a trilogy, it damn well almost goes nowhere."
The way they treated Luke Skywalker was disgusting
"What Rian Johnson did was essentially take everything that fans of Star Wars loved about the original trilogy and spit on it. The story made no sense at all, and appeared to serve the sole purpose of pushing a social message."
Rian Johnson certainly did this series a favour (along with everyone else in this movie).
"I thought it was awesome. I would watch it again. Great acting, great special affects and great Director. You can't go wrong with JJ Abrams directing. The CGI was great, if it's going to look fake, don't use it. But they did great here."
"Minus all the Canto Bight sequences, this to me would have been 5 stars. People are mainly upset with the arc of Luke Skywalker. That is the divisive tissue of this film. Rian Johnson made a phenomenal Star Wars film in my opinion and took it in a bold new direction. I wish he would have stayed on to write and direct episode 9."
This movie was terrible. Nothing in it feels like it matters and it doesn't make me care about any of the new characters. Finn is the only character that could have been good and they wasted all potential with him. All the characters from the original trilogy don't fit up with how their characters should act whatsoever. Terrible movie.
Doesn't deserve the amount of hate that it gets. I respect the idea of trying to take the franchise in a new direction but it just didn't work for me. Some of the character treatment felt out of place. Overall as a star wars movie it's disappointing but as a film its decent.
Episode 8 is better than Episode 9.
"A very good movie, with good special effects, a good sound and a very interesting story that shows that it tries to continue the new trilogy ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐."
Luke tries to kill Ben? Admiral Akbar killed off screen? Meandering scenes that go on way to long. Rian Johnson destroyed Luke Skywalker's character. The worst Star Wars movie by far.
"Amazing visuals, terrible story"
An insult to SW saga
Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy did their best to kill Star Wars with this installment. From Cranky Murderous Luke to Leia’s Mary Poppins impression in space to hyperspeed as a weapon. Not to mention the travesty of the wasted half hour on the casino planet to start the film. If you are a true Star Wars fan then you will or at least should hate this movie. This is the first time I’ve been heartbroken by a movie but man Rian did his best to ruin a big part of my childhood. If they ever let Rian Johnson near another Star Wars film I will revolt haha. Do yourself a favor and pretend this movie doesn’t exist.
"Messy, stupid plot. Boring characters, cringy moments."
"Good Stuff: Luke is good, including his jokes, Luke's perfect ""Jedi-like"" duel with Kylo, Yoda's cameo, Kylo and Rey vs the guards is great.

Bad Stuff: The casino planet, too many jokes, Snoke's random death, Rey is too powerful, Poe is just an a-hole hot head that learns nothing, Leia's force crap scene, Rose sucks, there's no politics and no first order backstory."
"This movie is horrible if you're a Star Wars fan. Filled with moments that rival the introduction of midichlorians. All space combat rendered pointless due to the ability to weaponize light speed. Luke attempting to kill his nephew because he showed some dark side in him. He believed he could turn his mass murderer father from the dark side but can't help his sisters son who has done nothing wrong? Canto Bight was the lowest point in all of Star Wars. How this story was thought to be a good idea is beyond me. The plot is a car chase in space at the speed of the steamroller moment in Austin Powers. As a Star Wars fan all my life, I couldn't find any moments in this film that were at least interesting to watch. The prequels were terrible but we got incredible moments in them, such as pod racing, light saber fights, space combat, etc etc. There are no moments in this film that were even fan service."
Really? Just not a Star Wars movie.
"Arguably one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made. The acting is mediocre, except for Adam Driver's and the OT cast, the script is atrocious, and the scenes with Rose and Finn are easily the worst."
"A better ""movie"" than any of the other Star Wars movies and this review is being written after seeing Episode IX. The only Star Wars movie that solidly expresses it's theme. As a sequel it succeeds by expanding on the world and intentionally rejecting the same old tropes regurgitated by the previous movies (especially Episode VII). The only reason it isn't getting 5 stars from me is because of the opening bomber scene which doesn't make any sense at all."
"The best word to describe the movie is ""space-trash."""
Amazing I love this film <3
Lot of dumb humor. A lot of changes to the Star Wars universe and what we thought jedis and force is capable of. Dissatisfying sequel to force awakens.
"So many weird choices stopped this from being a great movie. I thought the Luke disillusionment, the grey force and whatnot all could've been interesting, but nothing is developed properly or committed to. As we see after episode 9, the lack of lasting conflict here made the trilogy. It would've been new and interesting had Ray joined Kylo, or if Finn actually did sacrifice himself to save his new friends, but all drama is hinted at then backed away from. Also the humour felt very cringe and marvel and I held expected Finn or Poe to look at the camera with a goofie smile after a zinger."
"Not good.  As a stand alone movie with no established lore or rules, it may be okay....  But that's not the case here.  There are established Star Wars lore and rules.  This movie sought to break and undo all of them, seemingly wanting to toss aside 7 previous films over 40 years to do it's own thing.  Again, perhaps fine as a stand-alone, but not as a numbered sequel.  Sorry.  I saw this opening night at the theater and was so disappointed.  Because of this movie, I will not be seeing the Rise of Skywalker in the theater, the first time in the history of Star Wars I haven't gone to the theater to see one.  (Saw Ep IV in 1977 in the theater, and every one since.)"
By far the worst one. The way they portrayed Luke in this really hurt
Chocking us with idiology. Not becsuse someone took risk it's equals to good.
"Basically ""Space Balls 2"", rightfully making fun of the previous movie, ep 7. The way it destroys everything that the previous ""film"" has established, warms my heart, as there was nothing to be sad about. Technically, it does to Ep 7 exactly what Ep 7 did to SW franchise. But as a movie it's as much a failure as its predecessor, on every level."
"Probably my least favorite Star Wars movie, as the middle part of the trilogy I was disappointed that many of the aspects I was excited to see more of (knights of ren, snoke, Luke) were completely ignored or worse. Driver steals the show completely this episode. Sadly my favorite characters from episode 7 (Poe and Finn) were also butchered. The insane power creep in the Star Wars universe is also on full display."
The plot of this movie really messed up so hard that it cause many people not to like it. The characters of this movie were also ruined. Only good thing about this movie are the visual effects and the musics.
"Having now watched Rise of Skywalker, I like this movie less. Between this movie and that one, you will probably only like one or the other. This movie is a little slower, and is more character-focused, while Rise of Skywalker is faster and action-oriented. This one plays like a Disney movie, or a romance, where there's a moral and a happy ending, while Rise of Skywalker is more action-adventure, and I guess more open to interpretation. Try not to let political drama sway your opinion on either. They're both very good, but it's weird that they're in the same saga while being written for people who have decided that they're so different.
The first one was great, though. Pretty much everybody agrees on that."
2 years later and it still doesn't get better with time. Rian Johnson failed at Star Wars.
"Decent, but not up to the standard of the best Star Wars episodes. Daisy Ridley does an excellent job, and Adam Driver matches, but the rest of the cast is just OK. Plot resolves the saga in a satisfactory manner, but overall the storyline seemed contrived and “Disneyfied”, as was the last episode. Not sure what’s next for Rey."
"The Good: the actors were great as per usual, the score was terrific, and the movie ended, thankfully. 
The Bad: the plot was subpar, too many characters were poorly written, no development for anybody's story. Expectations were definitely subverted and not in a good way."
"I hope I could give zero, this movie is garbage, do yourself a favour and avoid it at all cost"
"O filme mais audacioso da trilogia sequel, trazendo novos elementos para o universo da franquia!"
100/100 The best movie of all time...by a country mile.
"Rey, Luke and Kylo are amazing and drives the plot forward while everything else is completely tasteless. 3/4 of the movie is basically the First Order fleet chasing the Resistence Fleet in space in the slowest pace ever. Nothing on Canto Bight sequence makes sense. Finn and Rose go looking for some guy then ends up freeing animals? Holdo doesn't tell Poe the plan for no reason only to cause further internal conflict. Hyperspace into enemy ships is now a thing. Finn could have sacrificed himself to save his friends yet Rose had to save him. Oh and Luke dies on a rock. Great progressive ideas, great visuals, great character development in terms of our Force sensitive heroes. I even love the Yoda sequence and controversial General Leia part. Other than that, no one does anything cool."
"This movie is not a sci-fi action adventure. It is a series of mediations on lose and male weakness. Very beautifully made and interesting. I don't mind at all the subversion, though it got a little old after the 5th time. Captures the dark feel of TESB. A great achievement."
"One of the best film of the saga.
Masterful writing with suprising twists. Innovative film within the saga. As ESB (5) was. Johnson is a master."
There was so much wrong with the space battles and just the timing of events in the movie.  Just silliness.  Running out of gas and hyperspace attack?  These were never things before.  Just awful.
"Love it so much. Such beautiful visuals, story arcs such an original story that sticks to the timeline and pacing is beautiful"
"In a brush or individualism and/or progressive intention, Rian Johnson either blatanly disregards or proceeds in utter ignorance of the wealth and consistency of star wars film that precede him. An entertaining film if it exists in a vacuum, a tragedy of disrespect and missed opportunity as a piece of the star wars continuum."
This movie is nothing more than a money grab / character assassination of Luke Skywalker. Trying to clear away the old actors so Disney can make new films. Luke Skywalker the man who could see good in Darth Vader would not try to assassinate his student.
So uncomfortable and completely against what the saga is all about
Reys story in this movie was exceptional. Finns story was pointless. But all in all I’d say this movie might be better than the Force Awakens. Not sure they’re about the same in love neither is amazing but the last Jedi Has some Luke so there’s that.
Do I even need to write anything?
This movie did not do anything for me. At first when I left the theater 2 years ago I did not know what to think I thought the graphics was good. Then I watched it again watched youtube videos about how bad this movie was and it all made sense. Why this movie is one of the worst pile of shit I have ever seen in my entire life. I would rather watch the Room on repeat for 3 days before I watch this movie ever again. If I watch the sequel trilogy again (*which probably won't happen cause F this trilogy) I want to know how any one enjoyed this movie and what the critics were thinking giving this movie better then a 90% When this movie started I knew I was in for a long run. When Luke through the lightsaber was so dumb it pains me ever seeing it again. Also how he wanted to kill Kylo Ren even before he did anything bad was some of the worst crap I have ever seen. Do not get me started on the stupid sub plot about Rose and Finn. Rose is one of the worst characters ever created. Also how she saves Finn at the end she should have died it would have redeemed her character a little bit. Also how Leia flew in space was dumb as well. Nothing in this movie is worth watching again. The graphics were the only good thing which they should be as they spent so much money on these films. I don't give half 1 or zero so I give it my lowest score a 1 and it is rotten to the core and you should never see this Star Wars movie once.
"One of the best in the series. Takes it in new directions while still fitting in, which is the right thing to do if you're going to make more of an old beloved series, instead of just trying to copy the originals."
What a mess of a movie. So incoherent that there are more plot holes than actual plot. Should have been called Burial of Star Wars. Disney really need a unified show runner to manage the whole universe.
"An original vision that (almost) tells a perfect story of failure, teachers and redemption"
Even worse than episode VII
"this movie trashed the skywalker saga, and set up the following for failure."
"not only the worst star wars film but one of the worst films I have ever seen.
I am finished with Disney star wars"
"Ignore the haters. Johnson tried to give SW a much needed injection of fresh blood, whilst also drawing in elements of the sadly sidelined ""Legends"" aspect of the Extended Universe. Whilst there are flaws with the film (the Canto Bight subplot could've been cut *wayyyy* down without hurting Del Toro's role), the tepid, course-correcting, ""fan""-fearing Rise Of Skywalker shows just how dull it can be to cling so closely to past episodes. TLJ justly takes its place alongside Empire and Rogue One as series highlights."
Amazing! This is the best film of the whole three.
Very poor story that deviates from the central plotlines of Star Wars. A waste of a movie in series
I thought it was a really good movie
the worst movie of the saga... What the f*** Ryan?
Trash. Horrible writing and characters. Evidently a goal was to ruin the character of Luke Skywalker. Shameful POS.
One of the most original and refreshing plots in recent star wars history and a well executed film by Rian Johnson. It was amazing throughout except for a few places and the plot twist was too good. Definitely deserves a watch.
"Probably the best out of the new trilogy. If only Disney had let Rian Johnson direct episode IX we may have gotten something better than the train wreck that JJ Abrams directed with ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" a film I plan to never watch again and will hopefully forget even exist."
"Unfortunately, despite the strong acting of the lead stars as well as the supporting cast, the poor storytelling and lack of vison makes this the worst entry in the sequel trilogy. Rian Johnson wanted to subvert and throw expectations and fan theories but he also threw a new track in plot with having Snoke killed and having Rey written as a nobody. May we never see Johnson's involvement in the Star Wars franchise ever again."
"If you have seen it , no comment needed"
terrible pile of bad movie why would you do this to people trying to have a good time?
Unless you want to be angered by stupid choices that make half of the problems seem pointless then don't watch it
"I found this movie unwatchable, boring, and bogged down in a lot of stuff no one really cared about. 
I tried watching again at home and couldn't keep watching. Long time Star Wars fan."
I wish I never saw this abomination. Watch it at your own risk. Everything you hold dear from the old trilogy is pissed on. It takes a great deal of effort to ruin an awesome franchise like star wars...... But Rian Johnson did. I hope you realize you created the worst imaginable rendition of a star wars film imaginable. Thanks for ruining childhood memories and Luke Skywalkers characteter. Who? Who wanted to see him milk a space alien instead of using his force and Saber skills? Please find me that person.... Oh wait that's Ryan Johnson. You should be ashamed of yourself.
"Really a slow speed chase!  That is what I paid money to see, I don't think so. Terrible side story with Canto casino, it had no bearing on the plot and didn't grow the characters involved. Destroyed the Luke character, the one who saw good in Darth Vader, by having him turn his back on everything.  Finn, Rey and Poe should have had some character building together, but I guess Rian Johnson just wanted to tear down the characters we loved... Let the past die. Nope, without the past we have no present and definitely no future. The only good scenes are visually; the throne room fight and Holdo's kamikaze plan.  Just don't watch this if you love Star Wars, it is definitely the worst thought out plot and is hostile towards existing fans without attracting new fans."
"This movie ruined Luke Skywalker. Luke was the one who had hope he was the ""new hope."" He didn't give up to turn Darth Vader, his father, to the light side and at the end, he did. But, he totally gives up on Ben and her just goes to the dark side. Bad mistake."
Star Wars Holiday Special > The Last Jedi
"Uma bosta, frustrante e desrespeitoso com os personagens."
Loved it!!! Excellent movie.
Storyline was horrible. Visually nice but terrible writing
"La Película Pues Si No Fuera Star Wars Es Buena, El Problema es que tenía muchas expectativas y cabos sueltos que explicar los cuales deja de lado y crea una trama que daña la personalidad de cada personaje presentado anteriormente en especial Luke Skywalker, Asesina Al Antagonista De La Trilogía Que Del Cuál Lo Arruina Como Personaje Y Deja Inconclusa Su Historia Convirtiéndola En Un Hueco Argumental, La Historia Es Lenta Centrándose En Los Personajes Secundarios Y Dejando De Lado A Los Protagonistas, Y Peleas Ridículas Se Personajes Sin Relevancia Prácticamente Está Película No Aporta Nada Al Canon Prácticamente Se Pudo Escribir En Una Novela Y No Habría Cambios Lo Único Importante Aquí Es Luke Y Leía Los Cuáles Se Les Deja Mucho de Lado Casi Si Relevancia Para Mi Fue Insatisfecha Y Decepcionante Dejándome Más Dudas Que Respuestas"
NOT a Star Wars Movie. Completely RUINED the trilogy. Could be completely cut out of the trilogy and it would be better for it. Being contrarian does not a good star wars movie make. Rose was the clingiest most annoying and useless character of all time. They killed Admiral Ackbar off screen...that's a sin. i'll never forgive rian for this complete disrespect and desecration of my most beloved series since childhood. stick to comedic mystery thrillers my guy.
"It never ceases to amaze me how critics will praise terrible movies if they exist within franchises they are fond of. The biggest problem here is that Last Jedi is just plain boring. It isn't just a bad Star Wars movie, it's an incomprehensible piece of junk. We jump from one boring story thread to another and are expected to believe its all unfolding in a fraction of the time that it would reasonably take to do this stuff. Do yourself a favour and go to Wikkipedia to read the plot details. At least you'll save yourself 2 hours"
"Come on dudes. Luke Skywalker is a hero. He is the HOPE of the galaxy. Not a grumpy old man. The whole casino stuff was dumb. Princess / General Leia is awesome, but not a floating statue. Weird. And a trilogy doesn't mean three unrelated stories with the same characters. No build. Poe is cool. Rose is corny."
"This was the first Star Wars movie that I was extremely frustrated with since the prequels. The prequels had Jar Jar and little Ani, The Last Jedi has equally irritating characters with Admiral Holdo and Rose Tico and Benicio Del Toro's character (his constant lip smacking is like nails scraping a chalkboard). Jar Jar and Ani were just annoying, but the cumulative function of these three in the narrative is to make Finn and Poe look like idiots. Why take characters that we have just come to know and like from the Force Awakens and then turn them into fools? Many of the characters make very frustrating choices for reasons that don't add up. Gen. Leia is supposed to be a revolutionary who never lost her fiery passion to fight the Empire. But in this she's depicted as very cautious and more determined to maintain order than fighting the New Order aggressively. TLJ changes Luke's character, but in a way that made more sense given all that is supposed to have gone wrong for him after the fall of the Empire. Even so, for this to work we need to see a lot more of Luke's failure to train Ben Solo, in flashback. That should have been the first third of the movie. Both plots of the mutiny and the scheme to get a hacker from the casino world should have been cut out entirely. This movie was an opportunity wasted and it left nowhere to go for the final film in the trilogy. The conclusion of TLJ is a narrative dead end and that is a fatal blow for a trilogy. Rian Johnson should have been put in charge of a stand-alone Star Wars story like Solo (he couldn't have done any worse!)."
"Not a bad movie, but not a good Star Wars move and a terrible EP8 considering it was supposed to lead to a solid conclusion but bought more questions than answers."
"I don't get the „critics"" opinion of how great the film is. It is pretty bad. The biggest flaw in my opinion is that they broke the concept of hyperspace by doing this kamikaze thing. Visually the film was okay."
"This is easily the best of the new trilogy, and only entry I'd label an actual film, where the others feel like extended commercial-free tv. This is an intriguing chapter that wasn't given much to build upon, but shows a much more professional grasp of dialogue, character arcs and editing than the two films which bookend it."
"Visually stunning. RJ should stay a DP or 1st AD. Leave the writing to others. Aside from the bad character choices, and being completely tone deaf, at it's core it's just bad story-telling. There were a few cool moments, but I wish JJ did this one too, at least it would have been his complete story. This is the worst of the Skywalker Saga movies. I pray Lucasfilm never lets Rian Johnson touch anything else in the universe."
The worst piece of Star Wars media to ever exist. I guess it did subvert my expectations because I expected something good.
"No, fans will not love it. Looks at the score here."
It was pretty terrible.
In hindsight this was a great movie.
"I got an idea. Lets write a story about one big ass ship slowly out running another big ass ship, and call it Star Wars. Nice job! 👍🏻 

Worst Star Wars movie ever!"
Unwatchable. Cringe-worthy. Utterly useless.
The movie was just a really bad Star Wars movie with really boring storylines and undeveloped characters that I didn't feel invested in at all
"A fresh, original take on Star Wars that's filled with heart and takes the characters of The Force Awakens to new places, challenging the actors and the audience to react to what they think they know - not being true."
"Those who gave poor ratings on this site for The Last Jedi should give this one another chance.  I didn't see this movie until after i saw the hot mess dumpster fire that is Rise of Skywalker.  However, this movie far surpassed my expectations that were based on the reviews on this site!  The Last Jedi is by far the best movie in the new Star Wars trilogy.  Yes, it had some ridiculous scenes like Leia flying through space, and Ren killing off Snoke (yet again saving Rey who is always trying to kill him).  But there was also a plot to follow, and story the viewer could believe in.  It was very easy to get on the ""good"" side and root for Luke to cast away his grumpiness and use his powers to help the rebellion.  It had feeling, and some nostalgia.  There was a darkness to it that really captures the hopelessness of the fight, and when you feel all is lost, there is Luke using his powers to give our new ""hero's"" a chance to escape and regroup.  It also has Rey playing a minor role in the movie, which definitely helps.  It's always great when the absolute worst Star Wars character in the franchise isn't around too much to ruin a solid story.  Unlike to episode VII and IX, this one feels like a Star Wars movie.  And despite it's flaws, it's good and worth multiple future viewings."
"Contrary to what many critics said, The Last Jedi is not only a bad Star Wars, it's a bad movie. For the ""bad Star Wars"" part, Rian Jonhson abandoned almost all the avenues proposed by J.J. Abrams in The Force Awakens and spit on Star Wars fandom without any purpose. Also, he didn't seem to know what to do with both new and original characters and forced in new characters for whom he created no attachment at all. Although some critics praised the boldness of the film, I was astonished to see that he literally copied scenes from Empire and Return of the Jedi, which made me laugh at the theater. For de ""bad movie"" part, the film feels more like  a mini-series in which the plot is either implausible or useless. Perhaps Johnson could have made a decent Star Wars standalone movie, but it seems to me that he was clueless for taking part in a trilogy that, again, J. J. Abrams had to rise from ashes as best as he could. The star and a half goes for some good action sequences, a few surprises, great special effects (as usual) and music (as usual)."
I have nothing to say besides good luck to the next director to fix this screw up of a movie
I will never watch a Rian Johnson movie ever again. This movie is pure disrespect to the Star Wars franchise.
"The Last Jedi doesn't deserve to be part of the Star Wars Franchise. It shouldn't even be a movie. The entire movie is full of unnecessary action that doesn't make sense, plot holes that need illogical outside help, and stupid characters that have literally NO positive, constructive development at all. I'm pretty sure if you just figured out that the Resistance gets annihilated and that there's a stupid new character named Rose who seems to care more about Finn than what her sister gave her life fighting for (get to that later), you'd be all set to watch the third movie. The tone, despite the destruction of all of the resources that the Resistance had and the deaths of nearly everyone, is exactly the same. Sure, they blew up the Dreadnought, and Snoke is dead, but Snoke wasn't going to live long anyway, and we never even heard of a Dreadnought before The Last Jedi. This is just an awful attempt to milk out millions of dollars out of an amazing saga. And when I say milking, I mean it. Luke literally milks a space cow in this movie, adding to the long list of crazy things I saw in this movie.  And then Rian Johnson decides that anyone who doesn't like this garbage movie is sexist? What! Okay, before people start attacking me by saying there's a ton of people who liked it, I have to point out that only 46% actually did. And then people point to the money this film made. I don't think you can point to that. The 54% who didn't like the film still had to pay, right? Or is there some new thing where I get refunds if I don't like it? Even Mark Hamill didn't like it!
The beginning of the movie begins with the Resistance trying to escape the evil First Order, who has somehow found the location of their secret base. I don't understand the whole First Order vs. Resistance thing. The entire thing makes zero sense whatsoever.  If the quote on quote ""good guys"" are in charge for a change, how does this rehash of the Empire come back? If this happens every single time the ""good guys"" are in control, why are they even in control? Why not let the bad guys be in charge for once? All of a sudden, there's these bad guys, and there's also child abuse, slavery, child labor, and cruelty of animals, under the ""good guys"" control? So why don't we try letting the First Order be in charge? But anyway, then there's some your mom jokes. Which, by the way, makes zero sense to me, because in the expanded universe, Hux doesn't have a mother. I don't want to spoil some Star Wars Rebels EU, but that joke was a sad attempt to be Marvel. The entire movie is full of attempts to be Marvel, even in scenes that should be serious, like the time Luke chucks the lightsaber off a cliff. J.J. Abrams built up this amazing cliffhanger that I thought was sure to make a good second movie. Rian Johnson decided to just make the entire movie full of bad jokes that ruin the movie and make longtime fans (like me, by the way. I've been a fan since I saw the first film. Force Awakens was the first film I'd ever fully seen in a theater. And I loved it!) cringe. But I went a little too off topic. Then, after a ton of explosions, they send in some bombers to destroy the Dreadnought. These bombers are literally B-Wings that look like they can't fly. But then that pilot of that (I think) Resistance A-Wing made a bad decision and said, ""Bombers, keep that tight formation!"" Next thing you know, half of a non-functioning Tie-Fighter takes out 3 of them because of that stupid decision to keep them tight together. But okay. That's not the stupidest character choice we see in this movie (I'll get to this one later), in fact, it's far from it! Because right after the destruction of the Dreadnought scene, Luke tosses what should be one of his most sacred items off a cliff!
Okay, more in depth about that scene, Disney flat out does NOT understand Luke. This is portrayed in the first two minutes of the film where they show him as a crabby old man who thinks the Jedi should die. I know, Mark Hamill, you tried to warn us, but none of us listened. The Luke Skywalker that we know and love had hope, and even though his father was the most evil person in the galaxy, he tried to save him. Now he lost one person, and he's some crabby, hopeless old man. That's not what Luke should be like. Luke should be trying to save Kylo Ren, rather than just wasting away on an island. The idea that Luke would do something like this is completely crazy! Luke's character is just plain misunderstood by Rian Johnson (same guy who called everyone ""manbabies""). Luke should be working for the Resistance, or struggling through his failures: NOT sitting on an island, sobbing about his life story. BTW, does anyone else realize how weird it is that Rey is able to fluently speak Wookie with no lessons? That adds to the long list of things she can do without any training, challenge, or struggle in the film. And before you call me sexist, I'm not against the idea she's female. I'm against the idea she's a perfect Mary Sue. Disney has consistently advertised this movie as having a strong female character, not even mentioning the 50 million others that came before it. But technically, Rey isn't a strong female character. Nothing she ever tries is ever hard, and so she never struggles through anything. So, technically, she isn't strong, because everything is just handed to her.
The scene then switches back to Finn, who wakes up wearing a bacta suit and runs around the ship. It is possibly one of the weirdest things I've ever seen in a movie ever! And then he runs over to Poe and they do another imitation of Marvel. Okay, so really quickly, they need to stop trying to be Marvel. In Marvel, we already know that the idea of two guys in costumes is already really unrealistic. So either they can try a semi-serious film or they can just be make a ton of bad jokes. But in Star Wars, we want to feel like it's real, not like it's stupid. So their attempts to be Marvel are not needed nor necessary. Anyway, he asks where Rey is, and Poe tells him... I forget. This movie is too forgetable anyway. Anyway, after that, we see that all of a sudden, you can be tracked through hyperspace, and pretty much all of the First Order arrives. The First Order launches some Tie-Fighters but not all of them, which makes no sense at all, and then they blow up the bridge. Leia was on it, which means she dies, right? But no, now with no training whatsoever she can fly. That made me scratch my head in wonder at how badly Rian Johnson was going to trash this movie. But don't worry! It gets worse.
So, skipping ahead, Rose, Finn, and BB-8 go to find the Master Codebreaker. Nobody else could (supposedly) break the Empire's secret code! Except some wierdo is capable of doing the exact same thing. That made little sense to me at all. They infiltrate the ship but somehow, the First Order knew they were coming! Maybe shouldn't have trusted the weirdo, Finn! Next, Rey heads to Snoke's throne room. Some stuff happens, and then we arrive on Holdo. One of the worst characters ever, in my opinion. She is current commander, since Leia's in a coma, and makes a bafflingly idiotic decision to have a secret plan she didn't tell anyone about. Even when Poe threatens mutiny, her reaction is ""Not much I can do about that, guess your in charge now."" NO! All she had to do was say, ""Let's sit down and talk about my secret plan!"" I mean, how hard was that? What is the moral? Blindly follow orders! Of course! Then we get to the praetorian guard fight scene, which is one of the worst fight scenes ever. Just look it up and watch it again in slow motion. 
Then, Holdo makes that jump to lightspeed. Sure, it was a cool scene and all, but Rian Johnson shouldn't have done this. Now, if there is ever an epic space battle, all the Resistance has to do to win is to launch a one-manned-fighter at the opponent. And then we will just start launching missiles with hyperspace at one another. It ruins space battles, it ruins the movies, it ruins Star Wars.
Finally, we get to rehash-just-with-salt-Hoth-also-known-as-Crait. The action all leads up to this. But it just happens to be one of the worst scenes in the movie. First, to start this scene up, the Resistance literally copies the Rebels with the binoculars, the AT-ATs, the snowspeeders, the people filling the trenches: all straight out of Empire. Real creative, RIAN! Then, Kylo Ren and the First Order have this battering ram thingy that will blow up the blast-door, and in my seat I was thinking to myself, ""Okay, aside from the fact that they are literally copying Empire Strikes Back, this has some potential to be a great action sequence."" No. To make a long story short, it did, but Rian Johnson goofed up and didn't include any of it. First off, you have the completely awful decision by Leia to put all those soldiers out in front of the blast doors to shoot down the Tie-Fighters. What are they going to do out there? Nothing! It would make sense to put them all behind the possible-to-be-breached blast door and snipe of the snowtroopers when they walk through the door. Then Kylo Ren goes ahead and says ""The entire Resistance is behind that door!"" No! They're all out in those trenches! Oh, he means Leia! Give yourself up, woman! Next, you have the Falcon scene with Rey. AARRGH!!!! That scene makes me so angry. First off, they try to get Rey to do an impersonation of Han and Luke when they shoot down those Tie Fighters in A New Hope (not even going to mention how unusual it is that Rey can shoot down three at once without any training), but in New Hope they have just escaped with their lives. In Last Jedi, Rey's killing people and watching other people she knows and loves die. And the impersonation is her saying WAHOO! I like this! Yeah, she most likely would! She's not just a Mary Sue now, she's a psychopath! But this isn't the worst part of the battle. Next, Hux calls for all of the Tie Fighters to follow the Millenium Falcon! I get some of the fighters, but all of them? Not a good battle decision, Hux! Leia made a bad decision and you wasted your chance to take advantage of it! And then, Poe says ""They hate that ship!"" I just find it weird that they knew which one it was. After that, Finn is going to sacrifice himself for the Resistance. At that moment in the theater, I thought, man! Rian Johnson has some guts! This would fit Finn's character, because he has been debating fighting the First Order since Force Awakens! But in the back of my head, I knew what had happened before and I thought, ""It's just a trick. Rian Johnson doesn't have these guts. And then WHAM! Rose comes out of nowhere and head on nails him. Regardless of the fact how far back she was, and how she perfectly hit him, WHY? She makes some quote: ""It's not about destroying what we hate, it's about saving what we love."" WHAT THE HECK! Okay, remember that Rose's sister gave her life for the Resistance. But then she's like, ""Love's better!"" And so she dooms the Resistance by letting the battering ram destroy the blast door for what? Love? That doesn't fit her character! I have to be honest, I wasn't a big fan of Rose to begin with, but this finalized it! Rian Johnson ruined a character! Next, when we look at the trenches again, all the soldiers are gone. We never see them again. Somehow, they disappeared without us knowing. Unusual, right? Finally, there's the stupid end of movie scene. All the Resistance died, right? But they're all smiling, patting each other on the back and celebrating! I just wanted to scream ""STOP SMILING, STOP CELEBRATING, YOU'RE ALL DEAD!
So what do we learn from the Last Jedi? Rian Johnson cannot be trusted to write a good, not-stolen Star Wars film! If you want a good film, I do NOT recommend it at all."
The good parts are really good but are ultimately overshadowed by flawed characterisations and out-of-place humour.
"While general fans may not like it, because it doesn't respect the originals and it treads its own path. It has the best cinematography, direction, and character arcs in any star wars film."
"The problem I have with The Last Jedi is with the many different plots happening, especially with the Canto Bight scenes. All the characters were poorly written and I didn't care any of them. The stuff that was built up from The Force Awakens was discarded and questions from it were ignored. While the visual effects and music were good, the plot, characters, and dialogue were awful."
"This movie does not deserve the hate it receives. While the cantobite scene was a little out of place, the rest of the movie was fresh and unpredictable. This movie offers a fresh alternative to the toxic and overwhelming family romance themes of living up to your parents legacy and finding your 'inner power'. Instead it offers valuable ideas, such as the idea that greatness can come from anywhere, an idea that is important in our society as we see an increase in divorce rates and broken homes. Unfortunately, the rise of skywalker  undoes everything this film did well and offers a dismal end to the skywalker saga."
"Worst of the 9 core. Better than Solo. I'd watch the Christmas special 100 times before watching this again. That said, Knives Out is great, so just keep Rian Johnson away from Star Wars and good things happen."
Really really bad.  Disney...what have you done to my beloved Star Wars?
Not good it was not Star Wars
This doesn't deserve to be in the Star Wars franchise. It makes no sense and the sub plots bring nothing but political bias to the unimaginative story. I tried to watch it again but made me cringe even more. RIP Star Wars
"Daring and inventive, if not always succeeding at it. The ideas here make me wish that Disney had laid out more of a plan from the start. Still enjoyable on its own anyway."
"Of ""The Skywalker Saga"", The Last Jedi is my favorite. It really did breath fresh air into Star Wars (for me). It was different. It was character driven. It set up the potential for something so much more than what The Rise of Skywalker was. I was excited to see a movie wherein the legend of Luke Skywalker was the spark to lit the fire that would be the Resistance: a heartfelt story of how the Force united a galaxy to come together in its darkest hour. That's the story The Last Jedi set up, and it set it up very well. I enjoyed Luke's character in TLJ. He's human, like the rest of us. I was discouraged to hear Mark Hamill's thoughts on Luke in TLJ. Here I am, having thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and all I can read about is the actors distancing themselves from their own movie. Apparently I think more highly of TLJ than its own actors. I am disappointed we didn't get to see a payoff to Rian Johnson's tee up. Maybe if we're patient, in 30 years, Disney will make another sequel trilogy and we'll get a proper sequel to TLJ. Although I fear the Emperor will somehow still be alive...again...for no apparent reason... Anyway, long story short: The Last Jedi was a great movie!"
"the last jedi is just a parody guys its not cannon, thats atleast what im telling my self"
I'm sad that you can't rate a movie 0 stars. Terrible movie that throws away every plot thread created by TFA. Only good thing is the graphics and parts of the Crait battle.
Almost destroyed Star Wars
"You can see that the Last Jedi was an attempt to say, ""greatness can come from anywhere."" It is, unfortunately, a message that is undone when you watch the utter pooh show that was Episode 9 that proclaims, no, the greatest heroes only come from royalty and aristocracy ... the rest of us are just spectators."
"tldr; The most cinematically beautiful Star Wars train wreck ever made with repercussions so critical that it derailed the entire trilogy and perhaps the end of the 9 movie saga.  

Rian Johnson and the Lucasfilm execs screwed up the entire trilogy with this one. The core problem here is that the trilogy has no structural plan. Even the prequels had a structural plan across the 3 movies. Each movie was handed off like a relay race where the runner could go wherever they wanted and it's never been more apparent than in The Last Jedi. Did this movie have beautiful artistic shots and some twists (interesting or upsetting)? Yes. Did it make sense as the 2nd to last movie in a trilogy trying to wrap up the Skywalker Saga? Absolutely not. I have a LONG list of issues with this movie but I think it comes down to these things:
- Trying to be ""different"" by butchering the Luke Skywalker character as though he had learned nothing from the originals.
- Canto Bight was so boring and contributed nothing to the story or series except some weird out-of-left-field anti-capitalist message. Even if you think its character development for Finn this was the most round and uninteresting way to do it. With so many legendary characters to explore more of (Leia, Rey, Poe, ect) why did they need Rose? I would have much rather them spent more time with Leia/others and what's she's been up to.
- Too many loose threads. Knights of Ren? Absent. Setting up meaningful story progression to wrap up all of the Star Wars movies? The Rebels end up pretty much where they started minus some of the favorite characters who died. I could go on.
- The core plot of a slow space chase was the most boring central plot for a Star Wars movie I could think of. I mean really? Of all the cool things they could have done in the Star Wars universe."
"Nostalgia, but none of the romance or the original trilogy.  This is nothing more than a blockbuster."
This movie disrespects the old saga characters completely.
"An innovative, thoughtful, original take on Star Wars.  Took the setup from Episode 7 and took it is a new, unexpected direction. Bravo to Rian Johnson for taking some risks. In my opinion, the 2nd best of all the Star Wars movies, only behind Empire."
Complete trash destroyed established lorr and characters for nothing.  This is not star wars
"The Last Jedi brings a real humanity to the Star Wars saga. With great twists and fresh new ideas, Star Wars reaches new heights."
"I walked out of the theater mad and got even more mad over time. TFA was not good, but this movie seems to have been made by someone when never watched the original trilogy or the Prequels, and just wanted to go their own way with no regard for canon."
Anti Twists for the sake of it. Luke's character motivations are paradoxical and Canto Bite was a waste of time. Terrible film and concept shrouded by good acting.
"The themes are amazing. Redemption, learning from past failures and the evils of capitalism. It's the best Star Wars movie. Probably some of the best sci-fi ever made."
Worst of any Star Wars movie
Filme incrível! Fora o que fizeram com o luke Skywalker isso foi o único erro.
Ruined Star Wars for millions of long time and young fans.
RJ destroyed everything JJ tried to do. First time I left a star wars film depressed cause the movie sucked so bad.
"If you have ever been curious about what the full potential of the Force could be, this satisfies that curiosity ten-fold! I'm not sure how much better you could have made this movie. It buttons-up a lot of plot points from even Return of the Jedi and then comes full force with some of the most epic sequences I've ever seen in movie history (and I'm comparing to Deathly Hallows Part II). 

I left the theatre fulfilled and excited, which is what I want from a sci-fi action saga like the one I grew up watching. It was epic!"
"Lol. That sums it up, just writing for the minimum words"
People are going to HATE me. But I thought this was a master piece. Kinda brought that sad destruction feel that we get from so many other movies that the Star Wars saga lacks a lot. Had so much action and beautiful scenes. Rey seems to battle who she is. Great movie.
"My favorite Star Wars film outside of Empire Strikes Back.  Some of the best dialogue, character development and by far the best shot movie in all of Star Wars.  Kudos to Rian Johnson."
"Star Wars is high fantasy. In high fantasy you create a world with its own rules, but once those rules are set, the same story telling 101 rules apply. For instance, a mcguffin or deus ex powers for the convenience of the plot are not good story telling unless established in the canon. Johnson is a good story teller, so i really don't know what happened here. 

A black stain on one of the greatest myths of our time."
"Absolutely horrible plot decisions. Rian Johnson and company sacrifices the integrity of Star Wars to make an admittedly very entertaining movie, but at too high a cost."
"I have been and always shall be a Star Wars fan, but I truly hated The Last Jedi. The production had a social agenda instead of simply trying to make a coherent and exciting Star Wars film: This agenda tried to muddle and ruin the entire new trilogy. Rise of Skywalker had to undo the rubbish that was The Last Jedi simply to close out the new trilogy on a positive note and save the spirit that was in The Force Awakens and the original Trilogy. I watched trash The Last Jedi twice, and that is all I will ever watch it. I immediately saw Rise of Skywalker three times opening week and will watch it many, many times forward. The Last Jedi is in the bottom three of Star Wars films; it is miserable."
"This particular film in the Star Wars saga is a disappointing one just like Episode 2 (Attack Of The Clones) I can agree with some fans that the action is amazing, however it's not one I'd personally reccomend when someone asks."
Garbage.  Nearly nothing to do with Star Wars.  Abandoned Luke Skywalker story.  Snokes is confusing. Bunch of dumpster fire garbage.  Rian Johnson should never be allowed to write and direct anything ever again.  This movie needs a do-over.
"There is little good to say about this film. As others have said, the Ray-Kylo arc is interesting and the only thing that forwards the story within the trilogy. We have Fin's side story that spans almost the whole movie and finishes with exactly 0 effect to the plot (something you learn very early as a storywriter not to do), also there is the forced love story between him and Rose, a mechanic, we have no sympathy with. Poes narrative of an apparent plot against the rebellion from within the higher ranks that ultimately ends in ""Yeah, we had a plan all along but decided not to tell anyone"" is beyond unbelievable. Then there is the cartoonish overarching plot of two very slow space ships that chase each other. It's like a Pixar's movie scene with a snail race that is played out ironically slow - but this is Star Wars... a movie about War in Space... Then there is a flying Leia Superwoman and a totally obvious rip off of the battle of Hoth from ""Empire Strikes Back"". So obvious in fact, that one character needed to clarify that it is - in fact - salt, not snow what we see there. And last but not least the slapstick humor... if you are looking for ""Laurel and Hardy in Space"" this is for you! From the first scene, I knew, I would not enjoy this film, and I was right. Every single scene, every shot, needed a joke, the only thing missing was a couch and a laugh track and we would have ourselves a sitcom.

This is all very hard critique but don't just take it from me. Go watch ""The Rise of Skywalker"" and see how J. J. Abrams himself tries his best to right the wrongs of Rian Johnson. How he tries to erase every mistake that has been put in ""The last Jedi"" and gives fans a dignified end of this Star Wars Saga.

Johnson made me lose hope for this franchise which has been restored today, two years later.

PS: I created this account only to write my critique for this film"
"Okay in parts, though I felt insulted walking out of the cinema. The plot, script and acting just didn't mesh over the entire movie."
Worst STAR wars EVER. This happens when somebody who do not carre about sci-fi or even star wars is an wheel of the production.
"Don't waste your time with this terrible movie, which was in my opinion the worst by far in the saga. It disrespects the original trilogy and the prequels, which created the fantastic franchise which is Star Wars."
"The moments I enjoyed the most were with Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. There were some things I didn't care for in the movie, but don't think it deserves the hate it gets..."
"How are the critics so in love with this abomination of a film?
Over powered characters - don't you miss the good old days when you have to actually be trained and proven jedi to wield the light saber, but just about anyone can do it.
 Young Ray beat the bad guy once so why even bother with the pointless ""Training"". 
Amazing graphics and all but just doesn't keep the integrity of a star wars movie."
"Awful awful star wars movie and ruined the new trilogy, this movie reaches from beyond the grave and ruins rise of sky walker"
"Rey and Kylo Ren's arcs were the only good part of the movie. It's rotten, but it's at least better than both of JJ's dumb focus group rehashes."
"This movie was terrible,full of plot holes and has usless side quests. It had few fantasticly choreographed fights."
"Pure junk, is impressive as director believes he is revolutionizing the franchise through his ridiculous plot twists, a movie that looks more like a filler episode."
"I actually enjoyed this movie, apart from some dumb stuff that sticks out on repeat viewings. The plot has some major issues but is still an enjoyable time. The theme of failure and learning from it is treated well, although it does over-permeate the movie in my opinion. I was ok with the plot twists and daring story choices, even if they weren't my favorite and I may have preferred something different. Overall, I didn't love it but I can't bring myself to hate it like half of the internet."
I had diarrhea after watching this.
worst starwars movie ever made ever. it is horrible. it might only be worth it if you have never seen any other movie at all.
Amazing scenes and environments. I love how the main characters evolve psychologically. There is a lot of things that can bother people but for me it was really good and as a bonus it made me appreciate a lot more the episode 7 so it's a big plus.
"The tone was too jokey for its own good, and half the movie -the ""fuel"" storyline- got more absurd by each scene. I liked the characters -even some like rose that got some hate; I thought she was great-, I just wish they were placed in a better movie."
"I loved this movie. Probably a lot more than a lot of people. And that's ok. I thought it was masterfully done. Everything was beautiful, and you got a lot more twists and turns than you normally would."
"While it has a few moments I liked, the poor use of characters and really disappointing plot made this movie probably my least favorite of all the Star Wars movies. The connection between Rey and Kylo up to and including the scenes in the throne room make this movie bearable to re-watch, but that's about it. Bad choices for and surrounding Poe, Finn, and Luke's characters killed this movie for me."
"It's  infuriating and a shame for the franchise that this crap is called "" star wars"""
It’s Star Wars - just enjoy this fantastic tale
"I love this movie. Definitely not perfect, but great characters and they do wonderful things with The Force and the legacy of the Jedi."
This is the worst film of the series.
"Production quality of course is high on this film but the directing and writing was awful. I wouldn’t pay to see the movie when you have so many good prospects on Disney+,Netflix, Hulu and Amazon prime video."
Worst Star Wars movie ever.
"A complete slap in the face to anyone that genuinely loves or cares about these characters. How dare you Brian, never work again please."
"Long, drawn out, incoherent to the plot of the movie before it and filled with meaningless plot devices in a vague attempt to create analogies between the SW universe and ours - all of which flopped. The story, while containing some gems, was simply poorly written and executed. Additionally, the writers & directors sacrificed their integrity through the addition of many characters with no other purpose in the story other than romance/drama. These 1-Dimensional characters usually were either dynamic characters from the previous movie or poorly generated new personalities."
"Some okay moments, but the main plot is an insult to everything that made Star Wars a beloved franchise."
This movie is so bad I accidentally watched it twice because I thought I had yet to see it.
An odd Star Wars movie that is entertaining but falls flat with its contradictory plot and miss placed humor.
"Ruined completely a whole saga filling the movie with politically correctness instead of developing the plot from Ep. 7.

Good job!"
it ruined the whole saga
"It's not as bad as people say, but it's not good. It deserves credit for trying a new story instead of rehashing the same plot like The Force Awakens did. But, sometimes trying something new doesn't work and this one really doesn't. It's better than the worst of the prequels though, so there's that."
This movie sucks. The ending sucks. The new characters suck. Everything in this movie sucks
"#TheLastJedi  is a great movie because Rian Johnson didn't listen to either of Fans ! Second best ever Star wars after #TheEmpireStrikesBack ! TLJ Artistically is gorgeous, and i love Luke why is human !"
"This movie was not perfect but it was the one film that carried the spirit of Star Wars most in the new trilogy. These movies have always been about hope and TLJ reinforces that feeling many times over. It's refreshing to see such complex and relatable characters in a setting that we love, but forging their own paths. Rey is a beautifully crafted character, made even more so by her constant struggle between the light and the dark, her struggle to define who is right and who is wrong, and her struggle against/with Kylo/Ben, even as she tries to find her place in the Skywalker story. What's more, her lack of a familial legacy in this universe made her that much more of a hero that we wanted to support. Additionally, the evolution of Kylo/Ben from start to finish of this film was so well crafted and evoked such emotion through the performance alone. Rian Johnson really gave us something to hope and look forward to with these characters."
"It's like RJ did his best to destroy the Skywalker saga. What a terrible movie, at least The Phantom Menace doesn't have the worst Star Wars movie ever title anymore"
"The mythos of the Force, ancestors and their decedents and finally all of the relationships that bound us to this story are treated as irrelevant in this film."
"The critics where not very good at what they do...they rarely ever are.

This movie subverted my expectations to the point where I stopped caring about any character's actions....what does it matter if there's some potential ""ex machina"" right around any corner?

Movie's messages are morally ambiguous and their execution makes me want to go enslave animals, punch women in power, and never have someone fall in love with me,

The tone of the movie is...ridiculous. Action suspense scenes are comedic. Dramatic exposition is also undercut by comedy. Was this a live animated cartoon? *dusts shoulder off*."
"A nonsensical plot which didn't follow the previous roadmap from TFA, with tons of holes. Jokes that snap you back to reality and make you remember that you're not in a galaxy far, far away. Rian Johnson set out to destroy Star Wars and he about did it."
"Despite what quote unquote fans say about this movie, this film dares to defy tradition and do something new and it works. Finally there’s a Writer and Director who’s willing to go out of the comfort zone of a traditional Star Wars movie. This film has been subject to almost universal disgust by “fans” but the “fans” are the ones who are disgusting. The constant threats, and bullying towards the director are sickening. The bullying of cast members off Twitter is vile. I’m glad there was someone who finally did something different and spit in the face of Tradition. This movie isn’t perfect or a masterpiece but damn it, it goes its own way I commend the hell out of it for doing it."
"Awful in every way. The philosophy of killing the past is strong here, and it stinks."
Superb! One of the best Star Wars ♥️♥️♥️
Just terrible. Critics are useless. Look at the difference between the fans and critics and you can see what BS the critics review are. This movie is garbage.  Luke is a miserable old wretch on an island and the evaporates at the end ??? What a waste of 40 years of waiting for Luke to bring back the Jedi!!  So many things about this movie are Terrible. The FANS will never watch this movie again.
"With no doubt in my mind the absolute WORST STAR WARS (any movie) EVER.
not even worth the time to explain why.  To me this movie does not even exists.  
Geezus, made me cry, like legit questions my life choices in being a star wars fan."
"The director clearly did not understand Star Wars. The jokes absolutely ruined the film, and the way Luke was treated was a crime"
"Go watch it again. I feel like people hate on this movie for no reason. It felt incomplete without Rise of Skywalker, but now that the trilogy is done, this movie fits into the other two quite well. Rian Johnson did well with this one. I notice a trend, people either hate this or love it. There's no ""like"". I love it. It reminds me of Empire Strikes Back, as Luke no longer wants to train Jedi like Yoda didn't, and a force ghost has to appear and convince them to help. Hell, Luke is a better helper in this than Yoda was in the OT. His death was honorable, and wise, too."
This movie is absurd
A goofy mess with uninteresting characters and storylines.
"If there is something that critics simply will never understand about Star Wars is that it is a fantasy series that never had the ambition to receive critical acclaim. Rian Johnson's lack of continuity and complete diversion of the central themes left the majority of us lifelong fans somewhat crestfallen. Luke was written to be something closer to a stranger than the beloved hero we all anticipated to see. This attempt at breaking the ""mold"" (even though it is a saga based on a myth-like theme of self fulfilling prophecy and fighting identity you are born with versus who you chose to be) was confusing, not justifiable in retrospect considering SW fans return for familiarity. Rian only stands out to me because he destroyed an opportunity to enchant us. The word hubris is said so much in the film I can only associate it to everyone who allowed this story to take such a pitfall after such a strong start with episode 7. I didn't appreciate that Finn became an insignificant side character, nor that Poe was all of a sudden an explosion crazed, hot-headed pilot as opposed to the person he was in episode 7. There was an amazing cast of female leads yet they single handedly destroyed their own rebellion star fleet, that seems a bit patronizing, doesn't it? And not to mention every side quest involving new character served no purpose, not even character building. I may be a fan, but I can be critical, and this movie doesn't live up to it's score on the critic's end of things. It is by far the worst of all the Star Wars films. The 2.5 stars are for Adam Driver and every other superb actor casted in this film who managed to hold their own even with terrible direction reminiscent of George Lucas's in the prequels."
"This was a terrible movie for the simple fact that Ruin Johnson the director completely changed the tone and feel of Star Wars.   People will think that people hated TLJ because of the details of the script,but that's a small part, larger issue was the complete change in ""tone""."
Horrible addition to the Star Wars saga
Imaginative and fun - what a fantasy movie set in space should be.
"The original Star Wars trilogy had a coherent cosmic message:  The Force was a revered and binary entity.  To hate evil doers, ironically, was to turn to the dark side and become evil.  The force could be employed to move inanimate objects, to enlighten or to anticipate present and future events.   Now, it seems, the force has dissolved into a metaphysical mystery wrapped in a cosmic enigma.   With the loss of an coherence, the Force is attributed to, well, just about anything.  Dead people infuse living people from millions of miles away.  Live people make dead people alive and then die for some unknown reason.   Anyway, ForceConfuson  makes for a lot of confusing and unexplained scenes that leave one nodding their head in a ‘knowing' sort of way, not because they know what is actually happening (am not sure the director even knows) but bc claiming to understand that which is not understandable is so very chic."
Amazing! Innovative film that finally moves the franchise forward rather than remake past films in the new trilogy.
"É uma sequência interessante, pois deu mais clareza em como a trama vai seguir. ainda assim, ficou uma ideia de mais do mesmo. para os fãs clássicos, agrada pela nostalgia, mas em contrapartida pelo fato de ser muito longo cansa em alguns momentos. trilha sonora e os efeitos especiais estavam ótimos e foram os pontos altos. já as doses de humor saíram bem fora do tempo."
"It’s very sad that there’s no way of taking everything that this movie ruined back. Pretentious, incoherent, self-indulgent and with zero understanding of the established universe and characters. This movie had all the potential to be the finest of them all but somehow RJ decided that it should wrap up all previous story efforts in favor of a TBD narrative"
"I really loved it! The casino sequence was unnecessary and there were some questionable choice, but the scenes with Rey and Kylo Ren were truly amazing! Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley have a lot of chemistry!"
To much cgi not enough character
The storytelling in this movie doesn't make sense for Star Wars. Rian Johnson ruined the franchise.
"So, The Last Jedi. I don't think I'd be wrong in saying that this is probably the most divisive installment in the Star Wars franchise. However for me, as someone who likes Star Wars but doesn't have a special affinity for it, I really LIKE this film. Let me explain:

Let's start with the elephant in the room: Luke Skywalker's arc.
I've seen a lot of people complaining about this and honestly, I don't get it. This is actually my favorite character arc in the film. Instead of making Luke an overpowered badass (which I would've been OK with), he is made into a complex character by having real struggles and complexities. His POV is really well explored through the excellent use of flashbacks and and his teachings to Rey. For me, this was a really interesting place to take the character and really kept me intrigued.

Second: the filmmaking.
This is by far the best looking Star Wars movie to date (closely followed by Rogue One). A lot of attention has been given to the shot structure and framing as well as the lighting and use of color. I thought that the force-bridge sequences in particular, were a real highlight.

Third: the themes.
I have been let down by a lot of recent Star Wars films because of a lack of meaningful themes, which disconnected me from them. So I was pleasantly surprised to discover some very well explored and relatable themes in this film. Especially the themes about failure and moving on from the past, struck a cord with me.

There's a lot more things I liked, but I don't feel like discussing them all so let me sum them up instead:

- The reveal of Rey's parents being nobody's

- Poe Dameron's character arc

- Production design

- Kylo Ren (Adam Driver steals the freaking show!)

- Yoda and Luke's student-teacher conversation

- The Force is mystical again

- Luke and Leia's reunion scene

- Luke vs. Kylo Ren

- Luke's ''death''

The only real criticism I have is that the Canto Bight sub-plot isn't always as engaging as it could be, but besides that I think it's a really great and well-made film. Not without its flaws but a very rewarding viewing experience for those looking for one."
"Ruined Star Wars.
Ruined Luke Skywalker."
Terrible movie. It is not cohesive at all with the plot lines laid out in the Force Awakens. Rian Johnson's vision was clearly different from that of JJ Abrams and it was a mistake to switch directors mid trilogy.
20 minutes scene against capitalism that doesn't even fit the story. A bunch of crap on all fronts.
"I love what Rian Johnson did with the characters.

The emotional connection is strong with this film.

The first hour-and-a-half is oddly paced (the film is long overall), but the last hour?

Almost perfect. Contains some of my favorite movie moments in movie history.

There's a change I won't watch this trilogy again; I will still watch TLJ on its own. I love it that much."
"This was an attempt to bring GOT style ""subverting expectations"" into the star wars franchise, while trying to embed world views on socio-economic issues. None of these things add value to the movie, and it automatically will ruin the next one."
"Coming back to this after watching the next movie in the franchise, and I still don't understand why people hate it so much. It's incredibly daring for a Star Wars movie, focuses hard on the character's development instead of fetishizing lightsabers, droids and other things that can be made into merchandise, has striking visuals and wonderfully choreographed fight scenes. It also asks questions about gray morality and responsibility in a way that no other movie from the franchise had before. It's a shame that it was retconned later on, and Rian Johnson forever has my respect."
"Too much time with new characters... ignoring the fun we had with Finn Rey and Poe in The Force Awakens... a couple of great scenes, but too little too late."
"Even if some mistakes have been made in this movie, The last Jedi show us beautiful scenes and was much better than the force awakens."
"Great story, acting, effects and ending!  Who is a ""critic"" anyway!??  #thankyoujjabrams"
Absolutely awful. Ruins several characters.  Breaks the star wars universe. It is obvious the people directing and producing do not care about star wars.  The side plot is useless. I feel bad for the actors. They did not sign up to be part of such an awful trilogy.
Hate it! Gutted to say I hated it slightly less than rise of Skywalker. Force awakens rendered pointless.
"What a beautiful movie!! Character growth and depth, deep emotion, absolutely hopeful message, has that very Star Wars feel...just really like it and could watch it over and over. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were amazing in this!"
Good effects and combat. Completely incoherent story that made no sense or seemed irrelevant at best.
one of the best star wars movies
"The Rise of Skywalker made me realize how much this movie screwed up in the Sequel Trilogy. From making Luke look weak to a not so great plot, the only thing interesting about this movie was Rey and Kylo's connection."
"saw, this film last night finally and i really enjoyed the last Jedi little bit more then force awaken and better then Rise of skywalker. . need to catch up on the other films from the beginning but the Disney trilogy was pretty great loved it so exciting to watch. and ready to see the other films."
A fresh take on a decades old tale. One that doesn't rely on patriarchal blood lines to tell a good story. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley have amazing chemistry and the fight scene with Rey/Kylo taking on the guards is one of my favorite cinematic moments.
I really love Rian's vision on the sw universe
Terrible movie. It broke several laws of the star wars universe and the characters were uninteresting and their stories could have been much better.
Just awful. Worst movie of the entire saga.
"Very little plot development punctuated by several big moments. This movie turned all of the men into flawed, weak characters while making all of the women into the embodiment of perfection. What is wrong with having both strong women and brave and courageous men? The purple haired lady was the single most pointless character in all of Star Wars. This movie was a huge disappointment."
Ok i cant stand the critics reviews of movies that they have not seen the movie or may i say had to be paid to say it was good because this was a train wreck from start to finish.  With the bombers that somehow can drop bombs in space to the ridiculous side plot about going to a casino planet made this movie not only bad but cringey to even watch. Critic's gave this movie a 94 % when the fans who payed to see this trash gave it a 40% so you tell me who is honest. Stay away from this pile of space poop.
This movie was absolutely terrible.
Fantastic cinema. Powerful scenes. Moving work. All around a great film to watch.
"The Last Jedi is easily the worst movie in the entire franchise. Yes, it's worse than The Attack of the Clones. At least the prequels don't destroy established characters like this movie."
"It ruins Luke character and makes Rey an even more powerful Mary Sue for no reason. Finn , the most interesting character of this trilogy is put with Rose just to justify her, and all they do in this movie is useless (they ocupy more than half of the movie) ...Why Rey have to find Luke to train her if Leia is awesome with the force without explanation? . It may work as a non-starwars movie. But ignoring Star wars Legacy make this film really bad"
"I loved it. Beautiful symbolism and imagery, interesting storylines and theme. I like that they explore elements and dive deeper into the world of star wars, building upon the force awakens and developing the characters. Lots of good messages from the story too about hope and self-worth. Like everyone else after TFA I was trying to figure out who Rey was related to but after initially being surprised by the direction chosen for Rey's backstory I actually prefer it. What a great message that you don't have to be related to someone famous or important for you to be powerful yourself, to have worth, to matter. A bold innovative take on the star wars universe that remains true to its core themes of hope and redemption."
Good Movie. Bad Star Wars Movie.
Again - Star Wars is crushing my childhood dreams - this movie was worse than all the others together - there literally is no story any more - none! Maaaaan so sad :(((
"Recycled, and not very original at all. And the only ideas they had were damaging to this once great franchise. As an avid fan Since the 80s, I was really disappointed."
Star Wars Masterpiece
"An ok sci-fi movie, not a Star Wars"
Movie was terrible and critics dont know good movies from bad movies... Directors direction in the movie was terrible... You brought Luke back to just do little to nothing and die that's worthless...
"He tried to push the Marvel Formula.

Sins are:
    B-Wings could've been used instead of the Slow-ass star fortress. Having B-Wings overwhelmed instead of Star Fortress picked out one by one would've been better. It would also show just how outnumbered and out gunned the rebellion was better.

    Things anyone knows is a bad idea that proves to be a bad idea (the First Order guy that sold them out)

    Yo Mama Jokes

    Giving characters that should've been side notes like Wedge and Porkins more screen time (Poe and Rose)

    The whole subplot of Holdo vs Poe

    Yo momma jokes by Poe

    Hux

    Canto Bight

    They celebrate instead of mourn after Crait. (Mourning would've fit the tone)"
"It will be unsuitable to say that its bad or rotten because its a good movie. From a critical point of view the movie had all features so that it could be called a Good movie, but it is understandable from a fan's point of view that it had some problems especially with Luke's Character. But I would say whatever they did it was justifiable. The acting was pretty good throughout. The story was good but felt extended and had missed a good enough ending, it gives you the feeling that it will end now but it keeps on going with some good moments but a comparatively bad ending. The sense of humour sometimes or much everytime feels unnecessary. The character development like most of the Star Wars movies was good with all the things happening. The score was brilliant. Screenplay was great as well, the movie however you felt about it kept you invested. There were a lot of plotholes. The villain especially the supreme leader tries to be intimidating or scary like its predecessors but couldn't do so. Sometimes major points of the movie were predictable which kills the essence of the movie. But somehow I felt satisfied watching the movie the first time. All in all I rate the movie a healthy 4.5/5 (90%)"
"The Last Jedi delivers an emotional response, perhaps at the expense of bringing more scope to proceedings, even so the emotional connection is welcome, and the visual palette is outstanding, the richest of any Star Wars film."
This movie broke Star Wars lore.
Subverted my expectations. I expected a decent movie. This was unsatisfying from the start 'till the end.
"It's well made unlike the final chapter but boring characters, unexplained levels of power, the worst fall of a hero ever, weak enemies all make this movie sad and pointless. Rey strolls to victory and never feels under pressure. A continuation from.the last 15 mins of the previous movie. The film that almost destroyed Star Wars, not because it was badly put together or edited, but because it feels like it is trying to annoy fans of the originals, rather than keep them on board while bringing younger people on too.
Should be re edited with extra shots of Rey training with Luke not a total loser."
"The film misses a great opportunity to drive the Story forward in a meaningful direction. Instead it relies on unnecessarily subverting expectations as a gimmick. The emotional moments don't land because they are immediately nullified by cheap jokes and the jokes themselves aren't funny because they throw you out of the movie, not fitting at all into the context.

Besides, the film also changes character motivation just for the sake of plot, betraying what could have been interesting character arcs. The different plot meanwhile seem like quests out of a video game, making the star wars universe feel generic and for the first time actually really small and boring."
It just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie. So out of touch with the rest of the universe that was established before it.
The movie contradicted its moral and emotional themes and did a disservice to the skywalker saga
After watching the Rise of Skywalker it became crystal clear to me that even J.J. Abrams  saw the Last Jedi as an abomination to the Star Wars franchise.  Half of the Last Jedi was pointless.  The story line was weak with major flaws in basic logic.  Most of the characters were reduced to one-dimensional caricatures with no soul.  It basically said whatever you think about Star Wars and the force throw it out and start all over.  It was easily the most disappointing movie I have ever seen.
Rian beautifully inspires us on a journey of self reflection that challenges us to learn from our failures and to look inside ourselves for our belonging.  The message of hope in realizing that anybody can make a significant impact no matter where you come from and that the living Force does not care about a patriarchal bloodline.  That we must not win by fighting what we hate but rather by saving what we love.  That no one is ever really gone and that there always hope for redemption and belonging.  It's what Star Wars was always supposed to really represent.  He uses beautiful imagery to convey the character's growth and journey unlike any other director.  My favourite Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.
ROSE TICO IS THE WORST CHARACTER EVER. RIAN JOHNSON SHOULD NOT HAVE DIRECTED
Was this even a Star Wars movie?!
All the other questionable scenes aside this movie broke star wars by having that hyperspace crash scene.
"New worlds...or reboots of worlds. Interesting cinematography. Story was slow, uses characters not communicating to create suspense and tension. New physics are introduced into the star wars universe. Being dead as a force user doesn't mean you cannot interact with the alive world. Some elements built up in previous film are abandoned."
Da hell was this sh*t
"This movie is so bad... Since the first scene. It is just bad... And when you finally see Luke Skywalker after 30+ years, you get dissapointed. I didn't see a single good moment in this movie. Just watch Ivan Ortega's re-edit, it is the only watchable version."
"Worst movie I have seen in a long time, so many errors, bad acting, terrible story.  Soooo much hipe"
"Wish i could give a zero, my friends made me watch it 
Nothing makes sence wtf"
Compete rehash of empire strikes back.
"The worst of the last three.  The story line made no sense - seriously, what a shite-show."
Thanks for completely disregarding the first movie RIan. you ruined star wars with this piece of trash movie. JJ Abrahams didn't even get a chance to make a good movie for the third one because of how bad the last jedi was.
Rian Johnson should stay away from Star Wars he has ruined Star Wars brand dislike the film.
It may be a good movie but I was very dissapointed with this boring and depressed Luke.
Please be more original.
Most disappointing movie in the saga
Terrible Star Wars the ONLY thing that was ok in this movie was Kylo Ren
Really messy directing and choreographing.
"Needed some work. But it’s Star Wars! As someone who saw the original, first, Star Wars when it first came out, I will always have a soft spot for this series!"
Is it possible to give a film this horrendous less stars?
We were picking a Star Wars for movie night and my 10 and 8 year old told me the Last Jedi is their least favorite and they don't want to watch it again.  I think its just bad storytelling.
"Critics are idiots for liking last Jedi. i imagine they do because of social commentary. But as a narrative that makes any sense, it sucked. When a director and writer want to leave their mark more than they want to be true to a narrative, look out."
"Bad, just really bad"
"Deep and complex, going way beyond the good vs. evil old plot and joyously overturning cliches. Fresh and new and at the same time... Star Wars!"
This movie was great interesting and amazing visuals with the planets and you can feel a connection with the characters and the fight scenes and you can connect with Kyle ren who is played amazingly this movie gets to much hate and it was a good sequel to number 7
I thought it was great!
"The story is told in the worst possible way. Disjointed, nonlinear, and confusing with too much filler. The choices weren't necessarily bad but their execution was terrible."
"I agree with others that while there was some good moments, the movie as a whole was a mess"
"Trash characters, trash plot, trash everything."
Rian Johnson had the guts to write a good piece of work that would entertain peope by showing them something new and heartfelt instead of letting himself get owned by old school fans and failing as a creative director.
Some of the character development choices were terrible and finn and Rose's mission was a useless story arc but the story overall was well thought out and I mostly enjoyed it.
"This movie is garbage. This isn't Star Wars anymore, it's a blatant cash grab that mirrors the weaknesses that plague the marvel franchise."
"The absolute worst star wars movie I've ever seen. Little to no character growth, insane plot holes, complete disregard and disrespect for everything that came before it. Rian Johnson should never touch star wars again"
Took things in different direction from force awakens just like empire strikes back did from new hope. Classic everything goes wrong middle chapter but with some clever Rian Johnson twists
A long movie but I enjoyed.
Complete trash. Wish I could rate it lower. Turns out the old characters were useless rubbish and we didn't know it. But Rey is the bestest evarrrr! The Force Awakens was really bad and this was much worse.
"It gets better with time. The Finn & Rose stuff is shockingly bad, but if you ignore that 30 minutes the rest is pretty good."
It has problems... but I don't think it deserves all the hate.
I disliked this movie so much. It felt like a terrible hodgepodge of ideas that didn't work at all. I'm not sure was the so called critics were smoking when they said this was the greatest Star Wars movie ever.
"Worst Star Wars film out of all 9 movies. I'll try to give it some points. Decent battle scenes, funny anecdotes. But it lacks all the quality things a Star Wars movie posses. Epic storytelling, good plot twists, and rich character development.
Honesty you could skip this movie entirely and watch the 9th and be happy."
Picks right up with the disrespect the last movie shows all of our classic characters. Leave it to Disney to ruin a classic series
This move is easily the worst in the entire series. It ignores and destroys every single plot point set up before it. I would have rather watched jar-jar binks for 3 hours than this.
"The most well-written episode out of the sequel trilogy. Beautiful storytelling, complex and emotional character archs, stunning simbolic and visual narrative, powerful message and a breath of fresh air for the timeless cosmic story with deep understanding of the mythology that's in the core of it. Thank you Rian Johnson."
"Just plain awful in regards of every metric except visuals.
Story from 7 is not really continued and everything that happens just seems dumbed down and meaningless. I mean a Star Wars fan will watch out of curiosity but I figure you can't make too many of this kind of movies without ruining everything we now about Star wars"
"Really bland and boring, missing the spark that the first sequel movie had, is like a parody of the ot and prequels. Nothing to really interesting to see with the same 1 dimensional characters."
"Original, emotionant and underrated. TLJ offer new roads to Star Wars saga and expanded the universe in the awesome way!"
"The original and prequel trilogy had their flaws, but were each original in both concepts and technology. Experimenting and exploring the strangeness of new worlds was of importance for George Lucas and something he wanted a fresh look at for each trilogy.
The sequels meanwhile bring nothing new to the table. They're shallow action movies set in a rehash of the original setting with nonsensical and character breaking arcs and plots."
You all ready know if the critics love it then it will be a horrible movie.
"The worst movie I have ever seen in my life!!! It's upsetting. I was angry after watching this. Rian Johnson, the director, literally spit on all our faces making this movie. It's filled with awful surprises that make no sense whatsoever. Worst movie ever. I would give it -5 stars if allowed."
"My opinion of The Last Jedi has improved a bit now that I've seen The Rise of Skywalker. It's still not the best Star Wars movie ever as it has some scenes that really turned me off, but it is better than The Force Awakens. Luke is awesome in this movie both on the island and later on. It really caps off his experience in the Star Wars saga and caps off the saga as a whole, even the prequels, in a satisfying way. The way that this movie ties up loose ends and puts the prequels and original trilogy into context make it worth watching even with its many flaws."
"Not the Star Wars I grew up with. A very well made film, but a terribly made Star Wars film. Takes very little consideration of established lore and in my opinion nearly ruins the character of Luke Skywalker. I write this after watching The Rise of Skywalker however, and I am happy to say it fixes a lot of what I disliked in this film."
The best of the saga.
"Movie critics need to rethink their impression of this movie in that it deviates from the original formula of the George Lucas saga.  Credit should be given to the fans who voted it in the 40s%.  The critics may rate it high, but in the end the fans bring in the profit and ultimate support."
So disappointed... force awakens was pretty good but this movie.....
I'm alsolutelly sure now it was the best SW movie ever done.
Really liked this movie.  It took risks and gave Luke a arc.
"Awesome movie. Not perfect, Roses character is bad but the rest is great"
It was literally the worst movie I have ever seen
Has the writer ever seen Star Wars?
"One of the best Star Wars movie, tries to get out of the same old Star Wars tropes, best Star Wars of the new trilogy"
This movie was horrible.
"I love this film. I loved the action, I loved the editing, I loved the effects and the story and the acting. And that lightsaber battle....it's the best lightsaber battle in the entire Star Wars saga(and that includes episode IX) We didn't deserve Rian Johnson."
"People expect too much from a series that has always been based on pulp tropes. It's *supposed* to be kind of goofy and imperfect. The Japanese call that ""wabi-sabi."" The Italians call it ""sprezzatura."" The best parts of this entry must be included with the very best parts of the series. No exaggeration. I loved it."
"This movie was terrible.

The Last Jedi is an excellent case study on why subverting expectations at every possible turn, without stopping to consider what the impact of that might be, makes for an awful movie.

The Force Awakens had its problems (and an unkind interpretation of the film would simply brand it as ""A New Hope 2""), but what it did manage to do was lay interesting groundwork for a new trilogy of Star Wars films.  Rian Johnson, instead of exploring any of the interesting story threads that were introduced in Episode 7, chose to completely ignore everything that had happened in the previous film (to such an extent that it felt deliberately malicious). 

This movie just feels like the type of Star Wars film that someone who actively dislikes Star Wars would make.  Old characters seem like complete strangers in their behavior and views.  The villain is killed off unceremoniously in the middle of the film.  Both new and old characters are given deus ex machina force abilities whenever the plot calls for it (which would have probably been fine if we were given some sort of indication that any meaningful training or development was happening for them).  

Almost every decision made for this movie lowers the stakes and leaves the audience less invested.  It is bad enough for this film on its own, but when you consider that this is supposed to be the second film in a trilogy, you start to wonder who allowed any of these choices to be made.  

The big, bad, evil guy?  Killed off in the middle of the film.  There's no one to replace him, by the way - Kylo isn't strong enough of an antagonist at the end of this film to stand in as the Big Evil.  There are no other candidates.  JJ had to bring back an old character to fill the void (which I have no qualms with).  

The epic climax that was foreshadowed earlier in the film?  Ruined with out-of-place attempts at humor (most of the humor in this film felt somewhat out of place).  Even if we forgive that, all of the tension and excitement that was built up for this part of the film is INSTANTLY dissipated when we find out that Luke ISN'T ACTUALLY THERE.  It felt like Johnson thought this would be a cool reveal, but instead it retroactively made everything that just happened feel completely hollow.  And then, for seemingly no reason at all (""extreme exertion,"" I suppose), Luke dies.  Just like that.  He didn't even do anything.  He never left his self-imposed exile.

The entire casino planet events were uninteresting, and ultimately pointless.  Had no one gone to the casino planet, nothing would have changed.  

Hyperspace rules were rewritten (another deus ex machina) in the middle of the film.  Honestly, the visuals of this scene were stunning.  It also introduced major plot holes for every other Star Wars film.  

Honestly, even if we pretend this wasn't a Star Wars film, the movie was awful.  Characters make arbitrarily stupid decisions (that aren't particularly in character), the humor mostly misses, the plot is arbitrary and uninteresting, and the new characters are boring and unchanged throughout the film.  There is hardly anything redeeming about this, besides the visuals.  

I genuinely left the theater upset after having seen this film.  It is hard to imagine it being worse than what it ended up being.  It is INSANE to me that the so-called critics have given this film a favorable score."
"It was a somewhat refreshing take on Star Wars, but the movie goes nowhere exciting and leaves the audience wondering what the point was. That being said, it was a better film than The Rise of Skywalker."
"Almost perfect. Johnson really put his stamp on Star Wars with a tightly woven narrative and unexpected turns. It feels good to be surprised by Star Wars again. There are only three flaws with this story: Canto Bight drags, the scene with Leia flying through space like Marry Poppins is truly awkward, and Rose destroying Finn's sacrifice. One more run at the script to fix these moments and this film would be on par with Empire."
"A canonical abomination in the (then) longest film in the saga where little is accomplished for the new cast, and the memory of the old is firmly stomped on with world-breaking logic, dull performances, low energy and an overall narrative that is neither justified or engaging at all. By far the slowest two and a half hours in Star Wars."
This is an over-powered movie done wrong. Rey has no weaknesses and has no risk of ever being beaten. The movie focuses too much on nostalgia from the more successful original trilogy.
The movie which killed Star Wars. I would rate zero if I could. Horrible.
Rain Johnson manages to honour everything Star Wars is whilst adding even more depth to the characters and their relationships. A welcome change from the usual formula!!
Just ruined everyting we know about the traditional lore
This movie has some great ideas but fails to execute them.
"This film was not only bad, it completely ruined the sequel trilogy."
This is a breath of fresh air in the star wars franchise in the 21st century even though it can do without a certain storyline that wasn't completely necessary or as interesting as the main one.
"the worst Star wars ever . subvert ""expectation"" !!! 
I didn't expect that it was so bad"
"Wow, are the critics out of touch.  The humour is lackluster. the chase scenes far too cgi based, the characters out of character."
"The smartest, most deeply felt Star Wars film ever made. Challenging audience's emotions and basic thoughts and feelings. Respects the symbolism and myth of the genre. Innovative, fresh, caring and clever. Each character and plot point carefully thought out and clearly planned. Re-invigorated my love of Star Wars and made me so proud to be among the fandom."
"I like star wars a lot and don't mind this trilogy, in fact, I really like episode 7. This movie was very cheesy at times. However, for the most part, I did not mind that, because to me a Star Wars movie is a bit cheesy. It also did not seem like it fit well with how the first movie in this trilogy set up the series to go. There were weird decisions that were made that did not benefit the plot, as well as questions that fans were asking from the first one (episode 7) that were not answered. Hopefully this will be fixed when episode 9 comes out"
"The theme of learning from ones failures, and rising above them, persists throughout the whole film. It's a mythic tale about being true to yourself and a cautionary tale about living in the past. Our hero's come out of this movie knowing that there is hope, and that selflessness is stronger than anything. It's also one of the strongest entry's in the Star Wars cannon on a visual level. The fandoms dialogue around this movie truly cloud its merits, which is a shame, but understandable considering everyone personal expectations built up for their favorite characters beforehand."
This movie ruined Star Wars for me.
"I actually enjoyed this movie. Sure there are some stupid scenes were they went for laughs such as when Luke threw the lightsaber and the casino scene. But other then that I enjoyed it, the movie had many cool scenes such as the throne room and the part were Finn fights Phasma. Overall I had a fun time watching this movie."
As a Star Wars fan from the beginning I thought the plot was lacking direction and especially didn't like the characterization- the depiction of Luke Skywalker was not accurate to the franchise- the ultimate hero who was going to sacrifice himself to save his father now has a momentary contemplation of killing his nephew??
"Rian Johnson's brilliance revives this franchise for me. This movie truly made me love Star Wars with every fiber of my being. Visually stunning and intimate, this movie made me feel like a true Star Wars movie should; hopeful and like I was a part of something bigger than myself. Packed full with symbolism and parallels, in-depth character development, and a moral to this story that resonates with people of all walks of life. Anyone can be a hero. 
I can't say enough about this film. Every time I watch it, I find something new that I didn't notice before that enhances the story. It's tragic that some fans don't appreciate this movie for the creative genius it is."
"Not just a bad star wars movie, it's a bad movie period. The plot was terrible and all over the place. Most of the movie felt like a pointless money grab by Disney. This whole film is a major plot hole."
Hated everything about this movie. Almost single handedly killed my love of Star Wars.
Rian possui uma assinatura original e ousada.
As a stand alone movie it's boring with some exciting scenes. When looked at as a part of the star wars saga it's complete garbage. It's clear that rian Johnson is not a star wars fan and his only goal was subverting expectations.
Worst Star Wars movie
This movie had horrible writing and ruined the potential of the overall story of the sequel trilogy.
"Brilliant follow up to force awakens, although Key characters like Finn and Chewbacca feel somewhat sidelined"
"The best movie of the trilogy. Ryan Johnson showed us Kylo crumbling soul, Ray's devotion, beautiful Carrie Fisher. The relationship between Rey and Kylo becomes deeper, more complex, more attractive. He showed us Raylo, and the chance that Ray could save Kylo's soul would bring him back to the light. 9th KILLED ALL."
"This is a alright movie at best, but a horrible Star Wars movie at its worse. It lacks respect for rules and characters essential to telling a star wars story. It may be time for a change in this predictable format but it should not have been done like this."
"The Last Jedi is a fantastic film. I loved him with all my heart, thanks, Rian Johnson"
best star wars movie ever
"It was as if the director didn't know anything about the characters. Luke Skywalker never would have thrown the lightsaber over his shoulder, and he sure as hell would not have given up on Ben Solo that easily. The horrible character development, it was as if the director didn't even read anything about what was built up until this point. You can skip this movie and the Skywalker saga increases ten fold. Its not about ""catering to fans"" its about the director not knowing anything about this universe."
"This was beautiful. 
Bold and fresh ideas that might've repelled the conservative part of SW auditory but I'm sure about 10 years later it'll be recognized as an iconic Star Wars film, on the same level as Empire Strikes Back."
"Total mess, do not watch it."
"Awful interpretation of the universe with pointless plots, unreal characters, and a message that was meant to tell the viewer that everything you love about Star Wars means nothing. Absolute trash as a story."
The only bad thing about this movie is that it made me think the rest of the trilogy would be good.
I remember leaving the theater absolutely disgusted by this abomination. I have never been more insulted than that day. It's a giant f*** you to Star Wars fans that grew up with Luke Skywalker. Only it's wrapped in the prettiest paper ever so it doesn't seem that way. I'm sure Rian Johnson could make a great and original movie. But this is a sequel trilogy. The story has already been laid out for you...I get his idea of not giving audiences what they want. And critics loved it. Than you completely miss the point of Star Wars....
"Still the worst Star Wars movie. This is some weird bizarro version of that every 30 min battlestar episode which is infinitely better. There are some great ideas here but they don't land with the Errol Flynn/Kurosawa/Man with No name/ Heroes Journey / Space fantasy loving original Star Wars fan base and for good reason. Having said that the direction is good, the visuals are stunning - the score is amazing, and the cast and acting are phenomenal. It's the story. The story is weak. The pacing is bizarre. The message is overly heavy handed and final, which makes no sense because this is supposed to be a middle chapter, not an ending. This movie set up every problem in the next one, but at least the next one managed to be fun to watch while the nonsense unfolds. Nonsense that is the inevitable direct  result of the choices made in writing this poorly thought out link in a chain. I have no problem with the people who love it for its own sake, it has some things in it that are fun and decent ideas, it just doesn't do it for me as a Star Wars. You can make a great electric minivan, but don't sell it to me as the next mustang."
World breaking and full of plot holes
my expectations that this would be a good movie were subverted
Worst movie in the franchise by far
TLJ is definitely ambitious.....just in the wrong ways. This movie failed to make any of the villains a serious threat if not ignored or killed off. The casino planet was a complete waste of time and Del Toro's character completely useless. I like some of the stuff with Luke. Luke fighting the false perception the galaxy has of him. Hate the saber throw and hate the fact he was killed off in the second film.
"Only rivaled in its poor execution by Spider-Man 3. Both of which I have only watched once, because to me they are both such selfish diversions by their creators that there is just no room for a fan.
To me, it's as if the creators sought to remove the formula and to drive away from the direction of the overarching story to create their own with their own rules.  Which is why Rian should never touch another property, make your own next time."
"pretty great, i look forward to more Rian Johnson SW, F the RJ haters"
"While there are scenes and characters in this movie that made little to no sense (The code breaker definitely. Rose and Holdo to an extent) there are still many great moments in this film that are visually stunning and add more depth to the star wars cannon. The performances are great all around and the Rey Luke and Kylo scenes are well done. This film takes risks that backfire, but some of them stick a perfect landing!"
Did the director ever watch a Star Wars movie before making this mess?
"I have mixed feelings about this movie. My first reaction was ""Oh, wow. What a movie!"" But then i saw many reviews from some reviewers, and i changed my opinion. But i think it is a GOOD movie. Not the best one of the saga (Of course). But, yeah, go watch it if you want to"
"A divisive film for me. At parts I feel it laughs at the unoriginality of Episode VII and attempts to distance itself from it with curve balls such as Snoke’s fate. Other times it seems to be intent on copying Episode V, like how VII copied IV, such as again having similar locations and themes to V. The film has some intense action scenes and great humour which gives it great moments, but this is offset by by a slow space chase, weird force-sensitive Leia and a pointless coup d’etait, that really goes nowhere. The film is an infusion of brilliance and sheer incredulity, but it is undoubtedly the best in the awful Sequel Trilogy."
"A+ character development, a beautiful story, and walked out of the theater feeling hopeful- like anyone could be special."
it is my least favorite of all Star Wars movies.
"A complete mess.  Movies are supposed to be consistent with their established universes, and this movie is not.  Key plot points and the style of this movie do not work within the Star Wars universe.  Illogically changing an established character (Luke) did not work.  Dropping the loose ends from the first part of the trilogy and leaving nothing for the third part were bold decisions that, again, did not work.

This movie has no redeeming value as part of the Skywalker saga and minimal value as a standalone film."
Brave to expand the universe. Misunderstood for having a complex script with a lot of symbology
TRASH FROM START TO FINISH!
Trash. Unpredictable does not make it a good movie. It was a slap to the face of every true Star Wars fans.
It's just not Star Wars and made it hard for its sequel to succeed. It also has a negative affect on Solo. If you thought the prequels were bad this is just a whole new level of bad. The comedy makes Jar Jar look good. If only JJ Abrams did the whole trilogy imagine what it could have become.
Ruins much of the story the previous movie set out to tell.
I absolutely lived it. I feel like people are review bombing this film and review bombing is BS. This film amazing and a great conclusion to the saga.
"well put together, challenging. I loved the most surprising reveal in the film. I loved how it set-up the characters to go beyond what Star Wars has been before."
an almost perfect star wars film that is only second best to Empire and ROTJ due to its deep understanding of the lessons of not only those films but the prequels as well.
No coherent plot at all. Random characters. Made no sense in the universe it was set it. Jumbled story line. Might have been worse than the happening.
"Now that rise of Skywalker is out, it's even worse than before"
"It ranks dead last on my list of Star Wars movies. It's visually impressive, and has some fun parts. But the story and characters didn't fit the Star Wars universe."
"In real time there were scenes and storylines that were very cringe worthy but I tried to ignore. The more I saw the film The more obvious those scenes stood out as huge mistakes and really too away from the film. The movie looked great, but sorry was lacking"
"Now that the newest and final story is out, I have a newfound respect and love for this film. It is the only film in the newest trilogy with new stories and ideas which could have ushered in a great and meaningful story end with actual growth. The political slight against The Last Jedi by The Rise of Skywalker is one of the most blatant cases of apologetic fan service by a major corporation to the nerd opiate, instead of letting the franchise (like many before) finish with the honor of making hard choices, good or bad."
"This is a Star Wars film with something to say. At times, it's perhaps a bit too much to say (like the lessons on war profiteers that feel out of place in the film), but generally the message it has about the nature of the force and balance is a nice addition to the mythos of the Star Wars franchise."
"Hindsight is 20/20. Having now seen the epic conclusion to the Skywalker saga I can safety say that this film is.... alright.
It's beautifully shot and well acted. But ROS wouldn't have its problems if it didn't have to fix all the wrong doings of this film. Serviceable narrative, nothing more."
"Defies everything you know about Star Wars, and disrespects its legacy. Worst Star Wars movie. Such a travesty this movie even got made."
I don't know what happened with this one.
"The worst film I've ever seen ever, don't listen to the shitty critics who call this their job. Avoid it and pretend it never happened and isn't part of of the SW universe."
Best of the new trilogy and one of the best Star Wars movies all time!!
A disgrace to all of Star Wars
"The Force Awakens creates potential with interesting characters, lore, and mystery. But Rian Johnson took over with The Last Jedi and it falls flat. There is no substance to this movie. It’s boring and dumb."
Absolutely terrible!!
"This fucking awful mess broke canon, had a plot that made no sense, angered fans, yet has a 91% from critics?  Seems like payola."
"Honestly the worst film created it insults the fans and the creators. It's a bad take on what should of been a great film, does it have its okay moments yes but as a whole the movie flops."
"It had everything to be great, but they dropped it."
"This movie is a masterpiece, period."
"I can say a lot of it was well made. I loved the set up of the connection between Rey and Kylo and the fight in Snoke’s chamber was awesome. The planet at the end was cool. Luke was ruined, Finn went from a character I really liked to an annoying character to me because he was so tied to rose who is the absolute worst character in Star Wars (everything she does literally leads to failure and she is treated as a moral superior character who is always right), the entire plot line of rose’s arc is dumb. They are able to fly off the ship undetected, wait why don’t they just fly people off one at a time in that exact same way? They happen to go to a planet and their plot is foiled by “a parking ticket”? They happen to run into a DIFFERENT guy who just also happens to be skilled enough to accomplish this task in prison? And that guy happens to be able to escape prison at any time he just coincidentally waited for them to be there? She has that god awful line where Finn says at least it’s all been worth it cause they freed the horse things and she goes “no,” reaches up and undoes the saddle of the last animal and says “now it was worth it”. The hacker they get betrays them and gets a ton of resistance member killed (failure in a movie is awesome but not placing any blame on rose was awful). Then she is suddenly one of the top members of the resistance and a pilot and crashes into Finn nearly killing them both in order to say her line about winning by protecting what we love not destroying what we hate and then surprise kissing Finn. Absolutely terrible character. Poe has a really cool arc of being a hot head and needing to learn that there is a time to wait and be patient and it’s executed awesomely by having him send off a mission that leads to deaths and failure.... but the reason he fails is cause the people in charge won’t tell him there plan for absolutely no reason is awful and then in the situation where the resistance is about to be wiped out he decides THAT is the moment not to put it all on the line? TERRIBLE! Killing off Snoke with no explanation of who he was and also saying Rey was a nobody was kinda cool and good to not follow the same sorts of reveals that are in empire BUT what JJ does in 9 is much better. Then there is the issue of this being the middle of a trilogy that is supposed to set up an episode 9 finale... it discards all of 7s ideas, but sure I could go with that, but it also leaves the most bare of set ups you can imagine so episode 9 has to spend half the movie setting up the finale in order to execute the finale. If not for Solo, and maybe episode 2 this would be the absolute worst movie in the Star Wars universe even though it is better made than all the prequels because it’s storyline is a mess. I love Rian Johnson, and looper was absolutely awesome.... this was bad."
perfection.. i loved it
"Horrible continuity, bad characterisation, highly wouldn't recommend."
"Does not hold true to the Star Wars story and world. That mixed in with all the poor character arcs, pathetic story line, made TLJ one of the biggest missed opportunities of all time."
"So, I recently went back to watch it (Today actually) as we are doing a family marathon to get ready for Rise of Skywalker.  This film is so much worse than I had remembered, and that's saying something.  Worst in the franchise.  Worse than the 1978 Holiday special."
"This is the most dumpster fire of a Star Wars film as we have ever gotten. This film's abysmal performance as the middle child of the new trilogy goes out of its way to ruin Star Wars as a whole. 
From start to finish - a complete failure."
"Too many subplots and needless characters.  Lacks the allure of the original 3 movies.  Whatever happened to ""less is more""?"
"At least twice as worse as the force awakens.
It deviates too much from from the original trilogy."
Great Action Movie Terrible Star Wars Movie
"literally nothing good in or around this movie, total waste of time and money"
Every other Star Wars movie (and show) has added lore and story line. Last Jedi failed at doing that. Instead Johnson sought to tear down what Star Wars has always been about and disregard lore and canon in many cases. And most importantly this film barely advanced the story of the sequel trilogy.
Really fun! It's controls the pace well. It's funny and action packed. I liked it a lot!
I am here to correct the injustice of the 43% score. It's ridiculous. There are so many great things about this movie. Just see it.
"It was a terribly done movie. The plot of the movie was disjointed, it had too many characters with not enough time to make us care about them. It had meaningless scenes for what I can only imagine was to increase the length of the movie, because it did little to nothing to add to the story. It made massive and controversial decisions to an established universe with rules and laws for what I can only assume was the sake of ""Something fresh and new"".

Overall, it had poor pacing, a boring storyline, scrapped the story of the intro movie, added too many characters and explained nothing about them. It was like the writing/direction of this movie was focused on hating Star Wars and then blaming the fans when it sucked."
I generally enjoy ALL Star Wars. I took this with a grain of salt and found it to be a decent movie.
If I could give this film 0 stars I would. I didn't truly realize how terrible of a movie this is until I saw The Rise of Skywalker having to correct all of its mistakes. 91% is nonsense.
"So much of this movie goes against what Star Wars is. Admiral Holdo should've been Admiral Ackbar and her whole ""I won't tell you the plan because uhhhhh..."" deal simply did not make sense. I was a stagnant and frankly boring set of scenes that had so many holes in the plot. You have a ship half the size of the Death Star and you only send 3 Tie Fighters at these frigates who have no fuel...c'mon. The writing for Luke absolutely goes against all that he stood for and honestly it renders the Original Trilogy pointless. Don't even get me started on Rose...she's a fun character but the Canto Bight lines are about as good as Anakin Skywalker talking about how much he hates sand. All in all, not a good watch and not a good movie. Rian Johnson does not understand the lore of Star Wars and is simply helping Disney push a commercial driven agenda."
"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. Unfortunately, this is probably the worse of the series. This has been such a waste of my time and money. Please, save yourself and wait until it comes out on Netflox or just dont watch it."
This is the kind of movie you get when the person in charge doesn't understand the brand of Star Wars.  This movie will be ignored by the fan base as a random spin off.
"This movie was amazing! I know there's a small, vocal group of fans that don't like this because of the choices that were made in the movie, but I personally really enjoyed all the decisions that were made, especially when it comes to fan favorite Luke Skywalker. The writing for this movie is absolutely superb, the amount of depth and symbolism in almost all of the scenes is absolutely revolutionary (in terms of a star wars flick). There's one scene that seems a little superflous, but I still enjoyed it. I think Rian Johnson has set up a film that I inspires hope, and kind of ""cleans the slate"" allowing room for more than just legacy characters to be strong force users and main players in the galaxy."
This movie was brutal and I'm still trying to erase this from my head. So many things broken/wrong with it. I think a solo movie of Jar Jar Binks would rate as low as this one.
"This movie is not an star wars movie. The director wanted to make something new and revolutionary, but the lack  talent to get there will make this movie just something i want to forget."
"Easily the best Star Wars movie. The story is rich with many rememberable characters. There are a million twists in the movie which make you wonder how it still stays on the same topic, but magically it does. The twists are all also so surprising that it's crazy, eventful, and edge of your seat cheering."
This is the biggest middle finger to the legendary stories and heroes of SW. It feels purposely made to destroy everything that made us care about SW. Can't say enough bad things about this movie (as there's so much said already) but it should be even lower on the rotten score.
Just a total swing and a miss. Didn't like the direction this film took the series and I didn't care for the new characters.
"A mixed bag. Rey, Kylo, and Luke are great but everything with Rose is terrible. Although I think in the end it works pretty well."
This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.
It was terrible. It completely ruined Star Wars. Worst movie I've ever seen.
This has tremendous potential and just ignored the plot lines of the previous movies. Its like the director has his own agenda and failed miserably.
"The Last Jedi opts to drop everything Star Wars to ""Let the past die."" It is entertaining and visually stunning, but fails to connect with the feel of Star Wars.
Everything from the slap-happy humor to Luke's treatment felt unnatural. The Last Jedi also toys with new powers and maneuvers in a way that seem great, but these ultimately set-up future Star Wars installments for failure. The most important being the Holdo maneuver. This act was visually stunning and left me in awe, but it breaks precedent set down before.
Rey and Kylo's connection is ultimately my favorite part of The Last Jedi. The two are like the opposite sides of a coin. Different in many ways, but still one, still connected.
The Last Jedi is fun, but I left feeling unfulfilled and questioning many of the ""goofy"" moments. Maybe this is due to my lacking of that blue milk Luke enjoy's so much."
Slow and then the light speed killer move that just ruins all of Star Wars.
"Absolutely terrible movie. By far the worst Star Wars movie, including Solo. The director took all the character development, and Star Wars canon, and simply flushed it all down the drain. Such a sad outcome for a highly cherished and well developed franchise."
"Say what you want about Star Wars Episode 8 but this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever since the original. I know there are some scenes like the Canto Casino side mission that should have been removed. Not to mention the new characters like Amilyn Holdo were a pain to watch. As for Rose Tico, she was ok, but she could have been written better for her. The good parts of this movie was the musical score, the visual effects, Yoda's reappearance, and the emotional ""death"" of Luke Skywalker. Overall, The Last Jedi upholds the sequel trilogy into new heights."
"The way Last Jedi treated Luke was very disappointing .  Plus, the whole casino planet, Rey's parents not mattering, hyperspace suicide bomber, not sharing escape plan, etc, made for a very weak plot."
Terrible Luke Skywalker story arc.  Half the movie seemed liked filler and was unecessary and all the build up from episode 7 was for not.
"I don't really recomend it. Kylo ren was amazing though (he gets 5 stars) I get critics confliction. I saw it out of desire to finish the saga in cinemas. For two hours I was bored, but the last 10-20 minutes were ok (whoever did that part - good job but it doesn't redeem wanting to walk out from boredom earlier.. (I loved the prequels, tv shows , games etc, not a huge fan of the new series but I remember people not liking the prequels and how that annoyed me so of you enjoyed the new stuff, ie last Jedi..go see it. If not spend your life/ time more wisely. . Maybe I'm the wrong era now to be interested in star wars.   if you liked the last jedi.you will enjoy it"
"Incoherent, bad script, bad jokes"
Never explained why the general doesn't explain the plan and only gets this man stars because of an ok ending.
"If I had rated this movie two years ago, I would've given it 3 stars. After TROS, this movie has no place to stand in the sequel trilogy."
This movie takes a huge dump on Luke skywalker and years of established lore
"There were many things wrong with the movie, but it mainly comes down to a bad story. This installment may have killed the trilogy. The main issue is that the bad guys/force are not scary at all. They are either having emotional swings or the butt end of jokes. This is not the Empire of old."
Good movie because the relationship between Rey and Ben is amazing
"The main space Saga of cinema has always been a work of rather conservative - all episodes are more or less sustained in the same manner. So it was before the release of Ryan Johnson's picture. The eighth episode is a look at the Canon through the prism of postmodern, so to speak ""Star Wars for Millennials"" - with a ton of inappropriate humor, undisguised fanservice, brazen play on nostalgia, disgustingly prescribed characters and dull narrative - and all this because of the unsuccessful plot, because the production here is beautiful, the visual is juicy, and the actors work at the limit of their capabilities. A few of the pros and break into pieces about the horrible script of the backbone, forcing us to count down the minutes until the end, most would have ended this mess."
"The worst Star Wars movie ever made.  Plot was terrible and boring.  So many twists that just come out of nowhere and for really no reason. There isn't enough time for me to explain everything I hated about this movie.  I heard Rian Johnson will do another trilogy and, I will pass on seeing that.  I hope Disney comes to its senses and gets rid of RJ.  This movie is just so bad.  Everything!"
3 rly bad stroy lines
"It has extremely good moments, but it cannot get through bad plot choices, annoying characters and the general feeling that this movie had all the ingredients for being extremely good and failed spectacularly in the cooking."
So boring and disappointing.
"It is awful ending of jedi saga.
Loss of time"
"Boring, long subplot that ends up being completely pointless. Too damn many stupid jokes, even during serious moments. New, unnecessary characters in place of old beloved ones. Artificial drama to extend the running time. Utter destruction of what was supposed to be one of the strongest characters in the SW universe. Killing off of the main villain without ever explaining what he was all about. And Leia flying through space... Perfect example of why no one should listen to movie critics."
Worst Star Wars movie.
A disappointing setback in the star wars sequels.
Most probably the worst film of Star Wars
"Horrible movie.  Plot didn't make any sense, dialog was lacking, no explanation of anything.  How and why did Disney release this as is?  And now the director is getting 3 more movies?  No thank you.  This movie is the reason we will not pay to see these movies in the theater anymore."
"It's a solid artsy movie, that kinda gets Star Wars like no other for me. It makes fun of funny concepts, it modernizes our heroes, and it talks about failure. First Star Wars to make me cry also"
"THIS WAS A LIT ASS MOVIE
WHAT ALL STAR WARS MOVIES WISH TO BE."
"I hate this movie, it doesn't feel like starwars movie"
"A hideous steaming pile of you-know-what. Rian Johnson nearly destroyed the legacy of star wars. It was so sloppy and poorly conceived, I am beside myself with disappointment and bewilderment at the critical acclaim this terrible movie received. I wil likely boycott Johnson from now on for his reckless destruction of a rich set of stories spanning 4 decades. His attempts to ""subvert expectations"" are neither clever nor well crafted."
"I couldn't go below half a star. By far the worst movie in the the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson should never have been given the opportunity to touch a Star Wars movie. JJ Abrams gave him so much to work with from The Force Awakens, and Rian hardly used any of it. And what he did use he screwed it up in the worst possible way. Sad that Disney allowed such a poorly written story."
This movie was garbage.  It was a complete betrayal to the characters and fans.  The pacing was messed up.  All of the scenes fell short in excitement and exposition.  Shame on Disney for allowing this movie to be released.
"The worst movie I had ever seen. No plot, completely disregards all the movies before it, and all Star Wars lore. If you want to see this movie, wait for it to come out on VCR."
Can I leave zero stars? This movie is a disgrace. Such a shame. Johnson made knives out which I really enjoyed. This was a train wreck
