"The film is horrible, a boring political plot, in addition to working on the relationship between Anakin and Padmé in a tedious and tiring way."
10x better then the ST
It's too long with a loveless  bland love story and some bad dialogue but the action scenes and the movies score makes those seen more bearable.
the romance is very bad but the rest is actually really good
"As a life-long Star Wars fan, ugh."
"Although the film could have benefitted from one more touch-up of the screenplay before shooting — tightening up  the dialogue, a little more context at times to some of the more complex plot points — this is a fun, exciting film which tells a pretty compelling story of political intrigue. Definitely, the most detective noir of the Star Wars films — which is a unique detour for the film saga. Ewan McGregor brings Obi-Wan Kenobi to life and carries the film on his back among the cast. At times, some of the details of the plot become a little convoluted and the banter between Anakin and Padme needs a re-write, but overall a fun fantasy adventure that lays the groundwork for a very compelling conclusion."
"I just watched this movie for the first time in a while and can say sincerely that it stands the test of time as a top notch sci fi.   With the luxury of knowing how the most recent trilogy finishes, it's a wonder that Lucas was so vilified.  A complex story and a clunky romance don't detract from the ultimate goal of expanding the Star Wars mythology and entertaining with light saber laden action.  Jango Fett's decapitation was the clincher.  Critics be damned!!"
"Like The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones gets way too much hate. It has great CGI, and some really exciting sequences. It also shows Anakin slowly turning to the Dark Side in some scenes, making the transition more complete for when he fully turns. Although the lightsaber fight at the end is a bit underwhelming compared to other duels, it still holds up well. And of course, who can forget the orgasmic sounds of the seismic charges!"
This movie is somehow even worse than the Phantom Menace.
I watched about 20 minutes of the worthless video game. It makes no sense and if you can sit through it good luck!
"Despite the awkward love story unfolding throughout the movie and the somewhat pointless interactions in some parts, it does a great job setting up greatly important events both for the next movie and in the Clone Wars series. Anakin's fall, the Clone Army, and Palpatine's rise to power."
This movie should never have been made. It's Lucas's Plan 9 from Outer Space.
it's not that bad to be honest. palpatine setting up anikan with padme. this is the story of how one man created the empire right under the jedi's nose
the worst of all the prequals. YES it is. Only good part is Obi-Wan fighting against Jango Fett. I can't even stand Anakin and Padme in this film. They are terrible at making me believe that they are in love. The end fight scenes are even lame. All them jedi couldn't storm Count Dooku. Come on. Feel free to sleep during this one.
"Me gustó mucho más que el episodio 1, el arco de Obi-Wan y Jango Fett es buenisimo.
Lo que falla en esta pelicula son algunos dialogos y algunas escenas romanticas en Naboo. Anakin es odioso 3/4 de pelicula, el personaje de Padme muy bueno. La pelicula termina cerrando muy muy bien con la batalla en Geonosis y el duelo entre Obi-Wan y Anakin vs Conde Dooku."
Better than the last one
"It was a much needed improvement from the previous installment (Episode I). Although slow at the beginning, it excites you with many tidbits of action through-out the film. Dialogue and romance was lack-luster but not as horrible as some would suggest. Overall, not a bad film whatsover."
"Better than Phantom Menace, But is that really the bar? Bland special effects carry a film with laughable dialogue."
This is my favorite one out of the whole franchise and I don't care what anybody tells me. I loved this movie from beginning to end. From the fight scenes to the casual dialogue this movie gets it done.
"You have to hand it to George Lucas, he listened to fans' criticisms of episode 1, and really toned down the amount of screen time Jar Jar Binks received in its follow-up, playing only a minor supporting role (albeit one with a great deal of relevance to the narrative). Now that's out of the way, I can start by saying that Attack of the Clones is a definite step up in quality from its immediate predecessor, in spite of the comparatively exorbitant CGI budget clearly set aside, this is probably the Star Wars film with the least amount of practical effects in favour of more computer generated ones. That said though, it really expanded the whole universe even further, introducing more new races, new planets & systems, and a menacing new villain in Count Dooku, expertly portrayed by the late, great Christopher Lee. The pacing of this film is far better than Phantom Menace in many ways as well, and additionally we are treated to further tie-ins to the original trilogy. And truly the pièce de résistance is the action set pieces we are treated to, not only do we have more Jedi knights than ever, altogether as well as in one place, but probably the fight that, more than any other, made 12 year old me grin from ear to ear like an idiot for the duration, in getting to see Yoda finally show off his sabre skills. That fight between Yoda and Dooku is one of those moments in cinema that I will always remember, because it was so out of left field to see the usually stoic and slow-moving Jedi master show everyone else up! Now the big, glaring downside to this film, which is the writing, proving that Jonathan Hales should never write another script for the rest of his career, because my GOD some of the dialogue in this film is dreadful! Not only that, but the on-screen romance between Anakin and Padme is one of the worst in film history, the poor dialogue aside, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman (improved as she may have been) just aren't convincing as a couple, the former in particular coming across as whiny, as well as a bit creepy in his pursuit of Padme. So this film has a lot of the positives of Phantom Menace, as well as a lot of the same problems, poor writing and not particularly thrilling acting performances by the primary cast."
A hilariously bad and stupid but entertaining movie. My least favorite Star Wars film.
"Much better than the first movie! The acting has gone up a notch as well as the quality in general. The writing is a bit rocky though. The way Anakin and Padme ""flirt"" is really them just saying they're in agony being near each other, which isn't what I would want to hear from the man I like."
Its one of the worst in the series but still good
"I think I've come to the realization that this film is the low point in the Star Wars series for me. Anakin is creepy, the dialogue is cheesy and it's just WAY longer than it needs to be. Again, it's entertaining enough, but there's just too much fodder for criticism and jokes."
A great middle to the prequels that could be better without the clingy love dialogue.
"It is often hated for it‘s poor dialogue. But where others see bad, I try to see good. The love story between Anakin and Padmé has a very Shakespearean feel to it, which is a nice back-to-the-roots attempt at Star Wars. Not the best of the saga, but a good film for sure."
"A potentially fun but unfortunately boring, un engaging, and easily missable installment in the Star Wars story."
"Una película odiada profundamente por los fans de Star Wars, aunque por el transcurso de los años ha tenido un poco más de cariño hacia los espectadores. Algo que resalta esta película, y las precuelas son sus ideas en general bien ejecutados, pero otros no, el romance es algo tedioso en partes, sus efectos visuales envejecieron un poco mal en algunas escenas, los diálogos tienen sus pros y contras, el guión mejora con el transcurso de la historia, los personajes en su mayoria estan bien desarrollados sabiendo su importancia en la trama, la misión de obi wan para encontrar el planeta ""perdido"", Kamino, está muy bien logrado y es algo esencial en la historia. Las escenas bélicas son magnificas, como la pelea en el coliseo, el personaje de Conde Dooku interpretado por Christopher Lee, es uno de los puntos más altos de la película, su actuación es digna de recordar, la banda sonora se supera cada vez más, el final cumple con creces, dando así el casamiento secreto de Anakin y Padme, y el inicio de la guerra de los clones.
Calificación: 6,8/10"
"Horrible, but can manage watching it at least, compared to episode I."
"Although I always think the acting of Anakin is a little overdone, the movie was amazingly done. The fight scene between Anakin and Obi-wan is the best in the entire series."
"This was so much better than Phantom Menace. We see how Anaking grows up in the path of becoming a Jedi. Ewan Mc Gregor is great as Obi Wan Kenobi. Some people did not like the love part, but it was OK to me!"
"A low point in the Star Wars saga, but the final act is still quite entertaining"
Movie is wack but without it clone wars the show wouldn’t have happened
the main reason for this movie is for its visuals and a story that could have been a lot better
Quase tão ruim quanto seu antecessor
Is the dialogue cringeworthy? Sure. Is the acting a little off sometimes? Possibly. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it better than The Last Jedi? Without question.
7.7/10 No secret. The weakest of the bunch.
My least favorite of the prequels. Even the effects were bad.
"Oh, Attack.  What to do with you.  I despised the prequels utterly when they came out.  I've watched the Plinkett reviews repeatedly. But between time, having children, and rewatching everything in order, the way Lucas envisioned: I am a convert.  I love the prequels and the world building they added to the OT (perhaps having so much of it torn down thanks to the Disney fanon caused me and so many to appreciate Lucas' vision)

That said, Attack of the Clones is still the least of the three. Poignant emotional moments (Shmi's death/Anakin's wrath, Padme's admission of love, WAR!) are regularly undercut by janky CGI, WAY too much cornball even for SW (a 50s diner? Waddyaknow?) and a sense of events cascading rather than being driven by actions. I love it, but it's handily my least favorite of the 6 Lucas entries."
"The weakest movie in the Star Wars franchise. The subplot of Anakin and Padme is one of the most forced relationships in any movie, period. They fell in love because George Lucas said so. Also, why was Anakin so whiny? Why did Padme become a Senator? So many questions and not enough interest to have them answered. On to 'Revenge of the Sith.'"
It was not bad. I kind of liked it. Definitely recommend watching to know the full story about Star Wars.
"not bad, dialogue is very wooden though"
"It was entertaining and was the perfect action film. However, the dialogue and cinematography was very wonky. Nevertheless it's not as bad as everyone says."
"Ok ... so if you watch this movie as an overall story ... its good. But scene to scene this has to be the worst star wars movie. Terrible dialogue, bad acting, poorly aged cgi effects, that diner scene is so weird as well.  Its still fun to watch but its suffers as a movie"
"Didn't even make up for the first episode of the prequel trilogy, it just made it even worse to watch. Can George Lucas write Dialogue, like, at all?"
"This movie is so good because the quality of the film and the space and the ships are very realistic. There is a part in the movie that they fight and this fight is amazing!!!!  
    I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"
"it's a meh movie with OMFG bad acting and horrifically bad romance with eh action and meh plot. Overall, It's pretty darn meh. 6/10 a fat C-.  3 year-olds will love it."
Who doesn't like Attack of the clones. Very great movie for a single mom like me with 12 devilish children. My evil kids said there should have been more clones but I say more sand.
The sequels made it look better.
This movie isn't perfect but it's a fine addition to the Star Wars story. The prequels get too much hate.
"Dull, cheesy, and unsure of what it's trying to be. It's like a daytime soap opera based in space for the first 2 hours and even then some of the dialogue wouldn't have survived the cutting room floor. Redeemed slightly by the final battle scenes which are pretty good, but until The Last Jedi destroyed the franchise this film was comfortably the worst."
"Old-school fans weren't going to be pleased regardless of what followed up The Phantom Menace, but Attack of the Clones stands worlds apart from its predecessor with action and effects as good as any produced at the time."
yeah we get it Anakin you don't like sand
Bored and disturbed by the awful script portrait of love
"Pretty good, just dosen't live up to the other movies."
"Worst writing of the bunch, but not the worst or the best."
WOWWWW!!!!!!!!! CAME OUT OF THE THEATRE CLAPPING amazing lovely i love anikan and padme's romance about the sand too AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Attack of The Clones has some very good parts, I felt that the entire third act of the film was amazing and action packed. But everything else in this film is hard to watch, especially the excessive CGI and weak romance scenes."
"If it wasn't for Phantom Menace, this would easily be the worst Star Wars movie out of the original 6. Don't get me started on the new ones.

The story drags on too slow. Too much time is dedicated to discussing politics and setting up a scene for a final CGI eyesore-fest. Anakin comes off as a cringey creeper who lusts for a woman more than twice his age. Mommy issues, anyone?

1/5. 1 full star for action, clean ""feel,"" and is better than Phantom Menace. That doesn't mean that this movie is good by any means. Don't be surprised if you fall asleep during a showing of this."
"With it's hit or miss visuals, bafling dialogue, wierd choreogrophy, and atrocious acting. Episode 2 is the undesputable worst star wars movie"
"FUCK THIS SHITTY ASS MOVIE, I'M OUT!"
This was a good movie while you feel like you have to get to know Anakin again and you do quickly see how is easily subdued by love and Padme.  We get to see where Anakin powers are at and how the Clone army is created and which brings some fun fight scenes with Obi-wan and Jango Fett.  The fight scenes at the end finally bring in that Jedi chaos that we have been waiting for with a host of Jedi fighting side by side.  And in the end we get to see our favorite Master Jedi Yoda show of some skills of his own.  This definitely better than Episode One but still not reaching the level of the Original trilogy.
"It has flaws,but it's better than 8 or 9"
"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones follows up The Phantom Menace by giving us a film that although suffers from some poor CGI, has a masterclass of a cast with Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christiansen and Christopher Lee who all play their characters brilliantly and have great chemistry with each other. The satisfactory-constructed plot has some awesome battle scenes and introduces some intriguing new characters. Although at times the film can feel a bit slow and suffers from poor and unnecessary CGI, George Lucas yet again delivers another fun film to add to the Skywalker Saga."
"In many ways this movie is more entertaining than its predecessor, but the romantic dialogue between Anakin and Padme is unbearable."
"This movie is just as cheesy as the previous one, but it can't even manage to be be fun for half the run-time.  The whole middle act drags on for too long with nothing to propel the plot forward.  But hey, it's Star Wars."
"CGI and dialogue are terrible, poorly written characters, almost all of the scenes in this movie are forgettable."
"My least favourite Star Wars movie excluding the holiday special, the clone wars and the ewok movies.Bad writing, cringeworthy romance, boring politics, Anakin is so whiny, bad acting, Count Dooku is a useless villain and not even the action scenes are good."
This movie fails at everything it set out to do. The effects didn't age well and now look like a cheap knock-off. The pacing is inconsistent. The writing is clunky. The action scenes are clumsily staged. The acting doesn't deserve to be called acting. Even the hair and makeup made me cringe. I try to challenge myself to have one good thing to say about a bad film but there's nothing here. There is no redeemable quality to be found.
"I think it is pretty obvious (cough ""I hate sand"" cough)."
"The worst Star Wars movie, not only it is not interesting, it's really awkward and cheesy."
Full of action and a great sequel!
Story was good enough for me to enjoy. Acting was sub par. Outshined by original trilogy
"Very underrated film, I am one of the few that enjoy the prequels for what they really are, good films. Yes parts are slow and boring, but the same can be said for the originals. Is the love story really that bad guys, it gives us death vader, I am glad they added the romance."
Attack of the Clone is an OK film with a pretty good popcorn value.
"Still not a good movie, but the Yoda scene alone is worth the price of admission"
"Suggested Audience: Everyone |
Critical Rating: B |
Nostalgia Factor: Insane |
Viewings: 4+ |
Detail: The romance scenes are rougher than the much maligned sand. Still, the film has much to offer, such as the engaging atmosphere of Coruscant, Obi Wan's detective pursuit of Jango Fett, and most of the third act. It deserves a chance from every moviegoer, simply because of its scale, though many will likely find it lacking."
"The fourth best SW saga! Fans are very wrongs about this film, is a great movie of the prequel. The battles of Geonosis, the story, the love story, the man hunt, the special effect & the lightsabers fights are very nice. This Star wars film is great in some ways and very less of the imperfections. A good SW movie."
"I personally like this film more than Phantom Menace, even if it is bad. The film had a few really good fight scenes and the ideas involving Boba and Jango Fett were pretty cool. While there still are many narrative issues and poorly done characters, there is enough action to make the film a slight improvement over Phantom Menace."
"The second film in the trilogy shows continuity with its predecessor but for all the wrong reasons. Again you can only get an enjoyment out of watching if you're a true die-hard Star Wars fan and even then it's hard to get enjoyment out of this film. CGI and special effects are once again look poor or at least outdated. Poor writing has once again lead to poor dialogue between characters, very noticeable with Anakin and Padme relationship. Many of the lines between one another are corny and cheesy, not in a good way which ends up making there seem like little chemistry with one another which is disappointing as the romance with them is a main part of the film. The brightest part of the movie in my eyes is the fight on Geonosis, seeing all the Jedi fighting with one another made for a very cool sequence. Ewan McGregor also had an improved performance as Obi-Wan, showing drastic change from his character in the first film."
The acting is trash! The script is trash! Everything is trash! This is trying to make money at its worst!
God awful acting. Poor script. Cheesy CGI. This is as bad as Phantom Menace. Ick!
"With this episode George Lucas punches above his weight class by attempting to elevate Star Wars to a far more complex, character and dialogue focused story than before. Simultaneously trying to pay homage to darker mature scifi films like his earliest work THX 1138 and respected neo noir masterpiece Blade Runner while still trying to maintain the charm and fun that people have come to expect from a romp through ""A Galaxy Far Far Away"". There's a complex political conflict, an assassination plot, a forbidden love affair, a dark brooding lead with complex motivations, entire scenes dedicated to character building dialogue and emotional monologues to highlight the acting. The only problem with this dialogue heavy film is that while George Lucas is a genius when it comes to creating interesting worlds and lore and pioneering new film tech he, to his own admission, can't write natural sounding dialogue to save his life; as Sir Alec Guinness put it, ""...[George Lucas'] dialog was appalling"" and many of the other actors Lucas worked with agreed. Fortunately for the original trilogy Lucas brought in talented writers, directors and actors to fine tune his scripts but unfortunately for this film and the prequel trilogy as a whole he wrote and edited the the prequel scripts almost entirely on his own. Not to say this movie doesn't have redeeming qualities. The action is very entertaining and the set pieces, sound design and cinematography are dazzling and the story actually is quite interesting. I'd recommend this movie if only for the reason that it laid the ground work for the vastly superior multiple Emmy Award winning  tv shows Star War Clone Wars (2003-2004) created by Genndy Tarkovsky and Star Wars The Clone Wars (2008-2013, 2020) created by Lucasfilm Animation which in turn spawned other critically acclaimed series like Star Wars Rebels and The Mandalorian not to mention the countless hilarious memes this movie has spawned."
"Attack of the Clones is underrated. If you accept the melodramatic dialogue and the unlikable main character, you can appreciate the suspense, the groundbreaking visual effects, and poignant story and the epic fight scenes. An assassination plot on a senator's life sets in motion a detective story cross-cut with a forbidden love story in the wake of an imminent civil war. The story is full of shocking revelations, abduction, mass murder, and political intrigue."
"""Attack of the Clones"", the second installment in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy is marginally better than its immediate predecessor but is again cut short by overuse of CGI and underdeveloped characters. The romance arc is cheesy, the battles are only decent, and the acting leaves something to be desired. But putting all aside, it isn't a terrible movie, and several moments give you the classic nostalgic feeling. Well, one step at a time.

55/100"
Episode II explores on the lore that episode I brought to the table. A good launching point into the clone wars Tv show as well.
"Still terrible acting and dialogue. Only slightly better than phantom menace. Anakin and Padme's love is totally not believable. Anakin as a character is whiny and unstable, and seems totally unVadar like."
"It could have been worse, hahaha ^^'"
The worst of the prequel trilogy but still better than anything Disney has put out.
"Terrible writing, shoddy acting, and an over reliance on blue/green screen, none which is redeemed by the scarce moments of decent filmmaking."
"The worst of all the Star Wars movies, Attack of the Clones is an exercise in tedium.  All of the problems of its predecessor are back ten-fold.  Even worse, we are subjected to the most creepy and awkward love story ever seen in a major studio release.  George Lucas' blatant attempt at cashing in on Titanic's success sinks.  This one isn't even for the fans."
Least favorite of the prequel trilogy.
"It got old quite quickly, especially the cgi"
Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones is a little off track when it comes to the acting. But in the end the satisfaction wins.
"Pros: They made Jar Jar's role smaller and less annoying. Ewan McGregor is still Good as Obi-Wan and I do like Yoda and his fight with Count Dooku. I think Christopher Reeve as Count Dooku is pretty good and Ian Mccdumind still does a pretty good job as Sheev Palpatine. I think that CGI Yoda is the only good CGI in this movie. I do like the battle of Geonosis because we get to see all of the Jedi work together. I do like how they had the plans for the death star this early in the saga. I do think Shmi's death is very sad and Anakin killing the sand people was the first sign of Vader and I liked that.  I also do like the Clone troopers and that literally all I like in this movie because I just don't like this movie.

Cons: The prequel problems are apparent in this movie because the dialogue has got to be some of the cringiest stuff put in a blockbuster film especially between Anakin and Padme and the Romance was so bad and it was very forced.  The way the Romance played out was disappointing because it was something I did want from the originals but it was executed very poorly.  If you thought Anakin was bad in the Phantom Menace he is worse in this film because of the cringy dialogue and he is acting so creepy around Padme and it is so cringy and makes this film dreadful.  The graphics are really bad in this film and it makes it look like a bunch of people are walking through cartoons. This movie has the worst lightsaber fight in all of StarWars' history because they are just spinning lightsabers around and it could have been so much better and the obvious Count Dooku stunt double. This is hands down the worst lightsaber fight in Starwars I know people enjoy the Jango Fett versus Obi-Wan fight but it is laughably bad because all these explosions knock over Obi-Wan and no scars, scars or damage is really done. We don't see Obi-Wan and Anakin bonding. Even though this movie does have it's moments they should have lasted longer and Anakin killing those sand people could have been the most memorable moment of the entire saga. There are only 3 moments in this movie that I like and they aren't even great there just good. Nothing in this movie really works and on rewatch I usually skip the romance 

I'm gonna give this movie a (D+"
"Bom, mas desnecessário. Fora dois ou três acontecimentos ele é totalmente dispensável para a saga. Cenas de batalha empolgam, bons CGis para a época. História não empolga entretanto."
"It used to be the worst Star Wars before the dark hours of the sequel. The love story is boring and poorly written. It is important though as it explains the existence of Leia and Luke. I just find it to be really boring.

EwanMcGregor's haircut is awful but he's still the best character."
"Just straight up NO! This pile of trash should have never reached past the notion in some writing room. Money be damned. You don't need another billion dollars, Lucas. This should never have been made. As far as I am concerned, it hasn't."
A politician falls in love with a teenager. There's also meaningless fighting at the end. 142 minutes of runtime 10 of which are story. Rise of Skywalker gets bad ratings while this flaming piece of garbage has been branded as a Star Wars for almost 18 years.
"With an unbelievable romance and some cheesy dialogues, it makes Attack Of The Clones a bit bland but saves it the plot and performance of Ewan Mcgregor followed by a great final sequence that the movie is an improvement to Episode I."
"Amazing, little bad dialog and acting but it's not a distraction. Anakin ""foreshadowing"" 
turn to the dark side may be annoying to fans who watched the original trilogy first but here is a reminder this is apart of the prequel trilogy so everyone knows that Anakin is turning to the dark side at some point we need to know how Anakin was turning from good to evil."
what sickens me the most about this movie is the fact that it looks so bad. the cgi is so frikin bad even for 2002. it looks like a cartoon. even the cgi of the original trilogy and i mean the original cut the space battles there looked way more convincing then this atrocity. in audition to that the action scenes which looks terrible go for too long. the movie bearly has any story. its just cartoony action scene after cartoony action scene. and its boring as hell. phantom menace had this problem as hell. both this one and phantom menace are atrocities. phantom menace i think is a little better then this one. attack of the clones is just the lowest of the low. i dont understand how george lucas thought this cartoony cgi is any good.
Jango Fett's fight scenes with Obi-wan and seeing how storm troopers came to be is cool but the movie is plagued with bad acting and a love story between two characters that have zero onscreen chemistry together. Oh and lets not forget CGI Yoda #aweful
As unneccesary as episode I.
"Second prequel movie is better than people think, great story, visuals, action and music. Began the Clone War has."
"Star Wars's 6 Lucas films are all good, in my eyes this one is just a good example of bad dialogue, and getting carried away. Ewan McGregor and this little mystery plot about this character who you never even see or hear after the first 20 minutes are all that interest me for a bit, the final 2 big action sequences save this movie from absolutely sucking, but it's not really worth sitting for 2h and 26M, not even memes can save this film"
"The worst part of this movie is that it proved that episode 1 was not a mistake. In my opinion this is the worst movie of the franchise, and a terrible movie by any merits."
"I think i fell asleep the first 5 minutes!
In my opinion the worst SW film of all time!
It's just unintressting and weird!
1/10"
Mediocre middle movie of the sequel trilogy which could have had a better second act. The third act does somewhat save the movie.
Much better than episode 1 but nowhere near as good as the original trilogy.
Very good Star Wars films and introducing Hayden Christensen in this movie and did not watched this film when I was little I think I saw a tiny clip of it on TV.
Better than the Phantom Menace
"I thought this movie was one thrilling joy ride, don‘t care what others say. Surpassed only by its successor and Empire"
"The worst of the Star Wars prequels seems to get worse with age.  The best that can be said about this film is that it introduces a lot of interesting alien ideas and cultures that are often fun to explore; if not in the films, in video games like Knights of the Old Republic."
"Good Stuff: Jango Fett, the final battle, casting.

Bad Stuff: The Plot, Doesn't feel like a star wars movie, the battle droid building anion and paddle  scene, The Anakin jumping out of ship scene is the worst scene in all of star wars, Yoda isn't used well enough, Count dooku, no real character development except for anakin, obi-wan, and kind of padme, Way to boring, too much packed into the movie, horrible plot."
Amazing I love this film <3
"Definitely the weakest of the 6 Lucas movies. Its confusing, it lags for extended time then moves at a breakneck speed, but it still has its moments."
This is when Star Wars was epic
"Next to The Last Jedi, Attack of the Clones is probably the worst entry in the Star Wars franchise. Hayden Christensen's acting and dialogue were really awful and let me wandering what would have happened if George Lucas had at least surrounded himself better to carry out the prequels. Still, the plot mystery was really interesting, so was the lightsaber fight at the end and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi. That unfortunately wasn't enough to save this movie."
GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
By far my least favorite of the Star Wars movies. It has its moments but they are very few and far between
"I love all my Star Wars movies. But this is the worst of them. Still pretty good, (Jango, Dooku) just seems to be very slow toward the middle."
"I'm not a diehard Star Wars fan. I've seen all the movies, seen them all more than once even, and I have my opinions, but when I see the way people talk about Star Wars online, I can't really find myself behaving the way that ""true fans"" or whathaveyou do. That being said, I think that the majority of the Star Wars films have been pretty good. The notable exception to this, for me at least, is the prequels. And yes you can include the animated Clone Wars movie that they made in that era too. These four movies, again, for me, are all bad. But even amongst them, there is still a ranking in my mind, and in that list, at the very bottom sits Attack of the Clones. Yes it is this movie which holds the title, of the very worst Star Wars theatrical release of all time."
"Exciting movie, bad dialogue but good cast and plot."
"I'm re-watching the old prequels - I haven't seen in Attack of the Clones in years. Honestly, I thought it was pretty good. Despite everyone's criticism, I thought Hayden Christensen was a great Anakin Skywalker: I think he does justice to Anakin's character - an emotional teenager with incredible abilities. In comparison to how Disney treated Star Wars, I still feel the prequels do justice to Star Wars world - like the culture of the jedi and treatment of the force. I think the prequels' story is absolutely incredible - the way that the Sith took over the galaxy by creating a false war which killed off the Jedi and increased the power of the head of state, who happened to be a Sith Lord in disguise. Emperor Palpatine is by far one of the best villains I've ever seen. The entire story is so good and so sound - all of it makes complete sense within the logic of the Star Wars universe. I actually really liked the books, like Revenge of the Sith book, and I think the great Star Wars story really helps that. Overall, I think Attack of the Clones is a pretty solid movie."
"If you can get past the first act of Anakin and Padme falling in love, Attack of the Clones is a fun action-packed adventure even without the most well put together story."
"Love it!  My favorite, on the same level as( For Me) Empire Strikes Back!  Both are my favorite movies :)."
"Severely underrated. People found it boring and overly complicated, plus people like to criticize George Lucas for everything. Yes, some of the lines were not what you'd expect, ""I hate sand"" but remember, A New Hope didn't have the best lines always either. Luke spoke how any American kid spoke in the 70s, when Lucas wrote that film. Anakin spoke like the 2000s."
Paying attention to the plot of the movie it actually isn't that bad and COULD have been one of the best installments to the franchise but how it was portrayed  on screen completely  ruined it the acting was bad and the opening scenes almost looks like it is going to be a cartoon.
if I was forced in a theater to watch this again I would bring math workbooks to do because they are so much more entertaining than this garbage. No good story. NO GOOD ACTION PERIOD. Horribly written cheesy romance. BORING.
"In retrospect, a pretty good star wars film. Just check when your phone when Anakin is wooing Padme."
"6.75/10. Though an improvement over it's predecessor, writer/director George Lucas has a long way to go in restoring glory to this franchise. Some great action sequences, superb effects, and great art direction are to be expected from a 'Star Wars' picture, and this one delivered. The improvements over the first episode comes from the acting and plot line featuring Ewan McGregor, who develops Obi-Wan into the wiser, more recognizable Jedi master we know from the original trilogy while playing psuedo-detective for the bulk of the film. Christopher Lee as the primary villain is a treasure also a treasure in his role. The film sputters when it focuses on the ghastly love story between Jedi padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). The forbidden love angle is so worn out and rife with cliche that it's difficult not to laugh at. Christensen portraying his young, dumb, and in love character more like a psychotic abuser is baffling. Portman's acting might have made sense had Anakin been portrayed correctly, but Christensen boxed her character into seeming foolish, unable to see the mad man before her eyes, and certainly not discerning enough to be a galactic senator. None of this is helped by the script, which gives the actors nothing to work with and is awful throughout. A mild improvement isn't strong enough evidence that Lucas should continue as the primary creative architect of this franchise."
I thought this was easily the worst starwars film until I saw the last Jedi.
"There are very few redeemable moments in this film. The problem is the story. It's just not that interesting from the very start. Even the ending, which is exciting, is poorly executed. Anikan and Padme's story in particular becomes boring, and their relationship feels forced and uncomfortable. To be honest, without one or two scenes that are really great Star War moments (Anikan and the Tusken Raiders, Anikan, Obi-Wan, Yoda vs. Dooku) this movie is difficult to watch."
"After watching Disney rubbish movie. This is really a damm good movie. At least the lightsaber fight was damn good. At least the story make sense. At least Obiwan was really convincing. At least the space fight is really good. At least the storm trooper die. At least Jedi(s) are powerful but they still die. And all Jedi(s) has their strength and weakness, they each have different roles and is very clearly shown in the movie. Disney's Star Wars is... plotless, illogical, breaks all physics, no continuity from previous 6 movies (plus Rogue One). No idea why Rey Space Jesus was ever needed to go through 3 movies when she could single handedly just destroy the entire Universe in the first 5 mins of the film. She can literally do anything. Teleport, heal people, bring dead people back to life, do Jedi mind trick, lift entire mountain range basically just do everything and anything she wants. Disney Star Wars is... just wasting people's time, it's rubbish. Its not inspiring and its almost just illogical (poor) action. Even the action sequence is BAD... REALLY BAD. I give George Lucas  STAR WARS 10 out of 5 stars. For being logical, consistent and good fight sequence."
Yoda`s lightsaber duel. Awesome
It was good. Not great. But I ♥️ Star Wars.
"It certainly has it's flaws, but all things considered this is a fun movie"
A movie too based on a romance with bad acting and overly long counsel scenes but still has the action Star Wars always delivers.
I like this even if it has flaws
"Fast paced, but the acting a little forced at times."
Boring on the first half. Only redeeming quality was the actual Battle in Geonosis.
"Quietly meanders through, with interest."
"Getting rid of jar jar binks is probably the reason why this score is higher than that of episode 1. But aside from that, the story is a bit of the same quality (not inherently bad) as of the previous entry, and also suffers from the prequel curse once again. But the action is stepped up a notch with noticable improvements in the acting department as well. The only main problem is that of anakin and padme's relationship which is downright cringey and hard to watch. However in the end still a good watch and a dramatic improvement from episode 1"
It has some problems but it is really good movie.
It was better than first but not that good
A great 2nd movie in the trilogy!
Dialogue is poor and probably the worst romance in history. Some great fights though stop it from falling into the terrible category
This movie didn't have to be made the thing that really saves it is the action scenes and the final act otherwise  I think this movie is the worst of the prequels ( yes I like The Phantom Menace better)
Lackluster dialogue but cool action scenes and an overall ok movie.
Really really good.
"A love story that cringes on unnatural dialogues that make every love scene painstakingly to watch. A new villain played by Christopher Lee that doesn't really do it for me. This movie does possess one of the greatest scenes in Star Wars history, though. Some excellent action sequence and great action."
Good for a movie but mediocre for Star Wars
"It is very cheesy and the love interest felt forced. The plot is good but just seems to be lacking development. However, it is still good because the fight scenes and other stuff are awesome"
"This one split me down the middle, it has very few good moments, however, when they're good- they're REALLY good.

The battle of Geonosis is one of the best moments in the Star Wars franchise"
"its very good, the clone war is epic!!!"
This movie made me hate life.
"In my opinion, this is the worst Star Wars movie. The plot is muddled with pointless points, yet some of them are interesting choices that you do appreciate. It's overall an okay movie, but it suffers from nonmemerable characters who you will forget right away."
"A sequel worthy of the original - the second episode increasingly convinces that the prequel trilogy is ""Star Wars for kids."" Almost no frame is complete without a terrible chromakey, every second creature is a miserable CGI, it just hurts to look at it. Ridiculous love line takes almost half the timing, while the branded action is given only 20 final minutes. Irritatingly wooden Hayden Christensen with his close-ups finishes off the already weak tape, the only salvation of which is in the development of the overall history of the Saga and tolerable battle scenes."
"I can stand a genuinely bad in every way movie, where you can tell going into it that the movie was going to fail straight from the premise. But what really gets me above almost all things is when you have a premise for a movie that is so great, so exactly what you would want, and so perfectly decided that you think ""There's no way this could fail."" Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is one of those movies that infuriates me so much for all those reasons. On paper this sounds like such a good film. It has speeder chases through Coruscant, fighting with kid Boba Fett and his bad-ass dad, the foundations of what would later be the Stormtroopers (Kinda), seeing Anakin Skywalker as a jedi before he falls to the darkside, More Ewan McGregor screentime, a whole stadium full of jedi fighting, the epic romance that would lead to the birth of the Legacy twins, SIR CHRISTOPHER LEE as a charismatic Villain! This sounds like it would be literally the best Star Wars movie ever. But despite every reason above this movie is usually, and rightfully so, considered to be the worst in the series. It looks pretty, it sounds pretty, it even had some good ideas on paper. But, and I really can't stress this enough, this movie is so goddamned boring. I love Star Wars Y'all. So much, but AOTC is a massive low point in this series. For every good decision made here there are 5 more bad ones to cover it up. None of these things redeem it, not one. It's is trash, and it sometimes makes me regret being a fan of Star Wars.      -Rhenn"
Just as bad as the phantom menace
Really good film (except a couple of love scenes)
"Though the movie is dull at parts with plot points that are uninteresting and bad dialogue at parts, this second installment to the prequel trilogy benefits more from an increased emphasis on thrilling action and a great performance by the late Christopher Lee. Though not the best in the prequel trilogy, it's still a appealing film to some~"
"It shows you the repressed feelings and the disturbance that is slowly growing in Anakin. We see the origin of the Storm Trooper and the majestic start of the Clone Wars. A romance movie, with powerful music, great acting, plot, scenery, choreography, character development; Despite the absurd criticism without foundation, it is one of the best episodes in all Star Wars."
not the best movie ever but still entertaining and watchable
"I absolutely recommend this to any SW fan!  Many people will say they dislike the dialog or acting or whatever, however the characters are perfectly captured as they are supposed to be.

Take Anakin, people complain about his skills with complementing someone to whom he is attracted.  Well how on Earth is a guy who was around Jedi (who are against such (as an order) and before that was on a backwater world as a slave without much outside interaction?  People never think about this.

As a side note the novelisation is a must read if you are into reading.

All in all 15 stars out of 5 for me :)"
"Good Action, but Anakin was whiny and annoying throughout this film. Not worth watching."
Awesome movie! Everything a Star Wars movie should include is being dealt with!
I know there's a lot of hate for this movie and I don't really know why. It does have a lot of drama that some might find boring but other than that I can't see any real reason for the hate. I do feel that people are too hard on Hayden Christiansen. He does a great job as an angsty teenager filled with anger and whose world is turning upside down.
Weak storytelling.  No star wars atmosphere. Stumbles from the begining.
that Battle in geonosis though!
good. if you love star wars you will enjoy this.
Hayden Christianson and awful dialogue. Nuff said
Boy where do I get started. I could talk all day on the flaws of this movie but its hard with how forgettable it is. If someone asked me what the plot is I would not be able to tell you. The dialogue doesn't sound human and is robotic. Poor direction for the actors leaving them with no chemistry or sense of the scenes. The worst part of it all is the dreadful and forced romance. I would skip this movie in my Star Wars viewing/binge and would be embarrassed to associate it with my love for the series.
"Attack of the most boring movie ever. Like Phantom Menace,  this deserves a 🦃 rating."
This movie grew on me since day 1 and I love the movie
Not the best but not the worse either
"Messy writing that detracts from the original trilogy and characters, far too much CGI, clunky dialogue, and an excellent score."
"I actually liked this movie, I thought it was well done."
Words cannot express the disappointment and utter depression this movie makes me feel due to the terribleness that is 19 year old Anakin Skywalker. It houses one of the worst lightsaber battles in the entire saga (Anakin v. Dooku).
No longer the worst Star Wars movie thanks to The Last Jedi
Anakin could have been better but Obi-wan was good
"some of the best visuals in the series, but lacking in some areas. still have a blast watching it"
The dialogue was so bland and cringe throughout the whole movie and didn't head anywhere and I don't even know what happened throughout the movie until the third act which actually was quite good.
"Dialogue is not its strong point. While taking a step in the right direction from the Phantom Menace, the stilted and awkward conversations and exchanges hinder the enjoyment and thrilling portions of the movie. While not bad, it is far from perfect and does not get me re-watching it often."
"Growing up with the original trilogy, and watching this trilogy was a resounding disappointment. This was the beginning of the downfall of Lucas. The special effects looked bubbly and cartoonish. It completely lacked the feel of the original movies. The vehicles looked more advanced/elegant that the original movies, and that doesn't make any sense because they were prequels. The acting was some of the worst I'd ever seen in a major motion picture. Surely technology advanced. The one saving grace for this trilogy was the incredible acting for the famous character Obi-Wan. Sam Neeson was incredible throughout.

The second film barely edges out this historically awful first in the prequel trilogy."
"Foreplay, cuddling – a Jedi craves not these things"
Ehhh it was okay romance terrible
It’s actually not bad
Jango Fett is so cool. Love the dogfight with Kenobi.
"I have to say it. Star War Episode II made the prequels worse than I had ever imagined. The only aspects that I really enjoyed were the action sequences, the battle between Yoda and Count Dooku, and Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan. I didn't like the relationship between Padme and Anakin, the screenplay is terrifying and boring, and the visuals are overused. Overall, Attack of the Clones is one of the worst Star Wars films so far."
now my eyes do not hurt from what is happening on the screen.
"Still not that good, giving us some things we all wanted and showing us some new things and characters."
Love this movie. Mostly because my wedding was the inspiration behind this film.
A movie ahead of its time!
"Could it be better? Yes
How much better? Not much"
Ewan MacGregor is fantastic
I would call this movie an improvement over it's predecessor only because it had a crummy universe to build off of and still didn't completely flop as well as being more visually interesting
"It was the worst film of the trilogy but I feel like it was because they tried to fit this into a trilogy, if they maybe spent more time and expanded this to either a longer movie or another movie then it would be better, Anakin's romance feels rushed and some of the dialogue seems explanatory less natural"
"It's the worst of all 9 films. The storytelling ist horrible and the dialogs: "" I hate sand"" nuff said...."
"I love this movie. There are so many great aspects to it, like the speeder chase, Anakin slowly turning more and more towards the darkside, and the introduction of the Clone Army. Jango Fett is great to see in his prime, and the end of the film just absolutely knocks it out of the park and makes up for any clunky dialogue. I like seeing Anakin and Padme fall in love. It is a vital part of the story. As vital as Han and Leia, or dare I say it; Rey and Kylo? ;)"
My least favourit Star Wars movie. Still enjoyable though
"I really want to give this film a better score, but I just can't. Here's the rub: This film indulges the silliest and most child-like parts of Star Wars. We get some great things here- Count Dooku, teenage Anakin, an adult Obi-Wan. But between these iconic moments are genuine nonsense. I don't mean child-like wonder nonsense either, but ""What the hell is even happening and why?"" kind of nonsense.

Ewan McGregor's performance is phenomenal, but for the most part, wasted on poor direction and cinematography. Ian McDiarmid is given more room to act here, and to surprising effect. Chistopher Lee is cheesy, but in all the best ways. 

Unfortunately, the center-piece to the film is a genuinely creepy romance that seems to fulfill the fantasies of thirteen year old boys... or maybe that was just me.

If you like Star Wars, you'll be able to sit through this film. Otherwise... just watch The Clone Wars tv show."
"Good action, nothing else is good in this movie"
The best prequel. The CGI holds up and is used in an amazing way. Christopher Lee is excellent as the villain.
Stale acting with really little action until the back end of the movie. Such a poor excuse of a Star Wars film
"""I don't like sand!"".... 
Dialogue is abominable"
"Well, that could have been better. Did I watch a video game?"
"Attack of the Clones is without a doubt the weakest entry in the prequel trilogy, as it is convoluted and the character interactions are very weak. The love story feels forced and cringe-worthy, the detective B-story, which ends up being more important for the A-story also suffers from a lack of cop-buddy for Obi-Wan to talk to. Anakin is in his whiney teenage phase, which makes for an uninteresting character and there is little to no interaction between him and Obi-Wan, which is what one would have hoped to get from this trilogy. The overabundance of CGI generated locations and effects is nauseating and stands in stark contrast to the original trilogy. Even at the time of release, everything felt out of place, because the CGI looked too crisp, too clean and as a result unrealistic.
If this was not a Star Wars movie, I would not recommend it. As it is a Star Wars film, it is still a must-see for the whole saga, as many of the most important plot points of the saga are being set up in this film. Natalie Portman also gets to do more in this film, than in both of the others and shines in her role. It is too bad that the bad writing leaves a bitter aftertaste to the otherwise wonderfully crafted story."
Not as good as the other prequels but we get some good works building.
So much better in retrospect compared to the shit we have gotten lately.
"Absolutely the worst movie in the entire saga, but is still watchable, and I can see myself watching the movie another time!"
"Tiene sus fallos pero presenta muchos grandes aportes en la historia, y tiene muchos momentos emocionantes"
"I loved this film, just fantastic!"
While not nearly as bad as The Phantom Menace there is enough action in this movie to keep you entertained.
"Attack of the clones has it good scenes from kenobi, jango fett and count dooku overall satisfying star wars film with action."
"CGI in it aged worse than practical effects of OT but other than that, this is peak Star Wars."
The Clone Wars are the coolest and most interesting era in Star Wars.
Attack Of The Clones is awful!!!! It is so slow and even though Aiden Christensen is good in the next one he is such a bad actor in this
its good stop the Bullshit
"Clones is nowhere near a perfect movie but when it clicks, it brings up all the emotions and heart of classic Star Wars. It's very nearly good.
 
Of course the visual effects are spectacular as is the character design but the same prequel flaws are also present. It's better than the phantom menace but not by much. A lot of the time it's pretty dumbfounding. There's just nowhere near enough of the good stuff."
"Alot of bad dialogue and like in episode 1 too much bad CGI, but also alot of awesome lightsaber battles and an amazing Obi wan make this movie good"
"Attack of the Clones is the worst prequel film, but thanks to some of the poor decisions made by Disney, no longer my least favorite Star Wars movie. 

As I said in my Phantom Menace Review, Disney should redo all of the CGI in the prequel films and bring it up to 2019 standards, which would go a long way towards making these films better.

The dialogue and acting in this film is worse than any in Episodes 1-7, though there are still some interesting moments in this film that make it feel like a Star Wars movie, unlike Solo and The Last Jedi. 

The assassin at the beginning of the film is interesting, Jango Fett is a cool villain, we get to see Mace Windu in action, I like Yoda's fighting, Anakin wielding two lightsabers is cool, Padme shows off how badass she is, and we get to see some of the seedy underbelly of Corusant, which I love.

My Review: C"
"Wow. I stopped watching Star Wars after Phantom Menace... then tried to watch this recently. AotC is worse, the writing, acting and directing choices are so cringey, I had to turn it off."
I like so much Kamino scenes
"Star Wars Attack Of The Clones was a bit better than episode 1. The action is great, the story is great, the visual effects are fantastic."
This movie did not have the best acting but it was decent
"""I don't like sand. It's coarse and it gets everywhere."" - Anakin Skywalker

Well you know what Anakin, I feel the same way about you. The perfect way to summarize this movie is that you only watch it for the battle of geonosis and even that segment was underwhelming."
Better than the Jar Jar but still a poorly written kids movie.
The worst star wars movie but still not too bad
"Great lines in this one, they don't like sand."
This movie well it felt too slow. There's too much plots I can't focus on. Although it did have some moments that will play throughout the Saga.
Sucked along with the other two in this set.  Totally ruined Star Wars.
"Good, but the ating is not that great"
"I like it because it's Star Wars, but this has some of the worse acting and dialogue in a movie I've ever seen."
"This is definitely worse than Phantom Menace.... the pacing of the movie is all over the place, there isn't much action in the film, as there wasn't in EP I but this does have some of the worst and cringe stories dialogue ever put on screen and especially for a Star Wars movie (I don't like sand). The worst parts of the script comes when there is romance involving Padme and Anakin its just cringe every time they speak to each other.... there isn't much chemistry between the two actors at all, Hayden Christian acting is wooden. The action when it gets to it feels bland to watch, even the lightsaber fight at the end of the movie is just bad, at least PM had the Darth Maul fight along with the duel of the fates music... this is the most blandest Star Wars movie out there..... there isn't much good things about it."
"I think this film gets to much crap its a good movie, nothing special, but I enjoy watching it every time."
It has not aged well with time. Only the last half of the movie mattered.
"Poorly acted, poorly written, and seems blatantly targeted at children."
Amazing film. Didn't deserve the hate it got. Must watch.
Bad plot with unrealistically dumb decisions combined with a boring first 90 minutes bring this movie down. Slightly better than the Phantom Menace but still mediocre.
"Let's be honest, there isn't a lot good going on here. There is no real draw for this film, and I always find myself skipping it. The pacing and dialogue are ""memeably"" awful, Mannequin Skywalker and Woodam Padmé's romance is boring and forced, and it doesn't have any emotion or plot."
"After the failure of The Phantom Menace, I expected Lucas to learn. Instead, he made a worse film. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so forced and is executed poorly. The whole jedi can't fall in love is a stupid rule that was created and broken in the same movie. The fight scenes were bad, especially the lightsaber one. Jar Jar Binks thankfully was made slightly better and had less screentime. The movie felt less directed towards kids. Besides Ewan McGregor's performance as Kenobi, everyone felt lame. At least The Phantom Menace had more realistic and less forced Chemistry with Anakin and his mom. Anakin and Padme feels bad, like who would date a girl that is at least 15 years older than him."
"Craptacular movie, plagued by stupid writing, no kind of acting from most of the cast . This is the worst film since phantom menace ."
Better then Disney. This was better then the last jedi
How the Clone Wars began!
"Proving that George Lucas was and is the creative soul of the entire Star Wars saga, this movie doesn't disappoint and continues the tradition of excellence in the franchise."
This was a meh movie. Weird dialogue and somewhat bad writing and direction. The reason why we watched this is to understand how Darth Vader came to be. We could have just watch Phantom Menace and put 30 years later cut at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith. Fine actors but holy cow there was a ton of CGI.
"Just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse it does. Episode II is a disaster of a movie. Featuring horrific writing, terrible acting from Hayden Christensen, and a sterile bland look thanks to a over abundance of CGI, this movie is painful to watch from start to finish."
"A cool Star Wars movie, specially for kids and teens."
"This movie pulled me in from the first scene, and never let me go.  Hugely fun, great action, great plot (a sci-fi mystery thriller!), mostly great effects, great performance from Christopher Lee.  And Yoda fighting like a ninja!"
"Dialogue with Anakin and Padme was again nothing much to speak of, but the acting and delivery were excellent. Plot continues to hold its own just fine if you can look past the dialogue. Also - watch this and Ep III in context with The Clone Wars TV show, and everything gets even better."
it wasn't that bad but Ieli loves it and i want to make him sad.
What happened to this franchise?
"I think this is one of the best of the prequel trilogy, especially for Christopher Lee's excellent acting as Count Dooku and for the story remembering a bit like an investigative movie, remembering that we see the creation of the clones and the amazing Boba Fett."
Way underrated movie
My pick for the worst movie in the Star Wars franchise. It's a snoozefest and almost never picks up. The story is built around a romance that is difficult to buy. Even the Yoda scene that should have been cool is kind of a CGI nightmare. The acting is pretty poor across the board. It looks like none of them really even want to be there.
"The weakest of the three prequels, didn't really like this film much."
"Following on from the anti-climax of The Phantom Menace, this sequel attempts to up the action and the drama, but still manages to be a weak link in the overall Star Wars saga. The ‘romantic' scenes between Anakin and Padme contain some of the most risible dialogue ever seen in a major motion picture, and Christensen is unable to ever make his character come across as anything other than a grumpy teenager. Meanwhile, the over reliance on CGI and green screen throughout has the visual panache of a cutscene from a video game. If only as much attention was given to the characters; take Lee's Dooku for instance, who is a welcome addition to the universe but is introduced without fanfare. At least things pick up in the final act, and seeing Yoda go to town with a lightsaber almost makes everything OK."
Better than the Last Jedi
"good movie, has some slow parts between padme and anakin where people are pissed off about, because the jedi isn´t a good womanizer, something that is just logical, because he is a teenager, finally back close to the love of his childhood, the only love, because while his schooling any kind of relations ship was strictly for bitten.
to be honest, if you don´t have the back information about the prequel trilogy, you miss a lot. but there is so much to know! so much is going on in the entire universe! so much better then the original trilogy, where the movies worked for them self really really good, but there wasn´t really any important stuff behind that..."
"While still not living up to the original it is certainly a step up from ""The Phantom Menace"". This movie might have some cringy sequences and bad dialogue causing an unnatural romance story. It has a good amount of action-packed moments with connecting plotlines that give our characters a lot of growth, 7/10."
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was good. Definitely a worthy episode of an amazing saga.
"Some fine visuals and battles, shame about the acting"
"Bad Dialogue, good action, horrible love scenes, good universe building. Short and simple, AOTC is an average film with it's pros and cons."
Seriously underated.
"So essentially Attack of the Clones is our wish granted after The Phantom Menace. There's no more Jar Jar, and they replaced Jake Lloyd. Ideally, that would fix everything, right? You'd think so.

So Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd are gone, Ewan McGregor actually has something to do other than sit around in an empty spaceship, there's no pod racing, Natalie Portman seems to have broken out of her plastic mannequin, there's more action, we're starting to see Anakin's turn toward the dark side, all of this should be a recipe for a much better movie than The Phantom Menace. And essentially, this is The Phantom Menace, with all of those tweaks applied. 

But. 

But I'm just going to say it now. I still don't know which movie is worse. I really don't. 

It's like George Lucas was so pissed off at fan outrage toward Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd that he took them out, only to replace them with a bland story, illogic, and terrible dialogue. 

I still can't decide who really wrote the script. Eight year old Jake Lloyd, or Jar Jar Binks. 

Before I get into it, just know that this review will have spoilers, but honestly, I think my ranting will be more entertaining than the movie. The movie goes off the rails, and I just might as well.  That's the natural order of things. 

It's the way of the Force, if you will. 

In one of the opening scenes we see Anakin openly arguing with Obi-Wan about everything a Jedi is and is not supposed to be. You'd think they'd have these discussions in private, or I don't know, sometime in the last ten years that they've been together. Instead, they have this bickering match in front of the queen and her advisors. 

It might as well have been Michael and Jan fighting in front of their dinner guests. At least that was more believable.  And entertaining. 

And Anakin comes on strong to Padme. Like, creepily strong. I'm pretty sure that once ten years has gone by before seeing each other, that automatically makes you strangers. All I can say is, lucky for him the MeToo movement hasn't caught up with their galaxy yet, because otherwise he'd have been ostracized from the Jedi counsel well before this movie got under way. 

But then again, Padme's not helping matters. There's that scene in the fire-lit bedroom where Anakin's like, ""I can't breath when I'm not with you,"" Padme is dressed like she was on the set for Fifty Shades of Grey. 

Look, I enjoy the espionage, as mindless and pointless as it is. We get to see Obi-Wan on an actual Jedi quest to figure out who's behind the order of the clones. I wouldn't have minded a little more Mission: Impossible brains added to it though, some sort of twist. Like, even something as simple as having Dooku be the most likeable Jedi on the counsel. Someone so affable and  convincing that even Yoda is smitten by him, and then when his secret is revealed, we're all thrown off. 

Instead, they're like, ""Yeah, it's this random dude whom we've never shown before. Surprise!"" 

I think I'm in the minority of people who actually like the chase scene through the city when Obi-Wan is hanging off of that destroyer and Anakin is trying to catch him. And outside of Jar Jar Binks, it's the first time in any of the prequels that they attempted a decent joke, when Obi-Wan was like, ""What took so long?"" And Anakin was like, ""I thought I'd look around for a spaceship that I liked. The right kind, the right color . . ."" It wasn't hilarious, but the movies have been so dry up until this point, that I kind of smiled because it was at least trying to be charming. Like when a toddler tells  a really bad joke, it's just so cute because they're trying so hard. 

And let me preface by saying that even though I'm pointing out things I like in this movie, I realize that almost every frame of this movie makes no goddamned sense and is completely illogical. 

Like young horny Anakin being assigned to protect the senator, who's also young and horny, but they're forbidden to bump uglies. Not to mention it's his first assignment! 

Let me break this down in earthly terms. On Naboo, the queens are elected officials that can only serve two terms. Queen Amidala was such a beloved queen, that the people wanted her to keep serving, but instead she succeeded Palpatine as the representative of the Galactic Senate.  

That's like if John Wilkes Booth had his nuts cut off and had his throat slit by a band of freed slaves on his way to the theater, and Lincoln had lived to serve out his presidency and see the Civil War to a close (I realize this could be a Tarantino movie), and Lincoln was so favored by the civilians of the United States of America, that they insist he stay in office as a senator or some official role, but then the White House catches word that he's being targeted by John Wilkes' brother. Because he's pissed that his brother is dead and that the country is unified under the Union's flag. The White House catches word of the assassination attempt, so they send our lanky hero into hiding, and who do they get to protect him? 

Travis, from Old Yeller. Because he's young, ambitious, and has a gun. 

Not the more experienced, available Jedi. But a Padwan. 

A young, horny, creepy Padwan. 

But as I'm watching this, I can't help but wonder. If someone like Leonardo Dicaprio had been assaulted with this role, would he have been able to pull off the shitty dialogue? 

Up until this moment of the movie, aside from the cool chase scene after the attempted assassination on Padme, nothing happens. 

NOTHING.

Qui Gon in on some secret spy mission, and we're expected to believe that Anakin and Padme are falling in love. This is where I can blame the acting, the script, and the directing. Nothing works. All three of these elements are like the monsters at the end of this movie, and we're in the arena as audience members being eaten alive by this nonsense. 

I can much quicker believe that Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs have more sexual chemistry with each other than Anakin and Padme. And they're like two of the most badass cops in movies. Not that gay guys can't be badass cops. At least not that Hollywood has shown us, anyway . . . 

There is a really cool scene where Jengo Fett is chasing Obi-Wan through an asteroid field. I love when they go through one, it's very claustrophobic, and then Obi-Wan releases spare parts out of his ship that sets off the missile and then an asteroid starts to rotate as Jengo's ship flies by and we see Obi-Wan's ship clinging to the backside like a bug. Good stuff. 

But, because it's the prequels, nothing can go unspoiled. Throughout this whole scene, there's no music, just the sound effects, and it's almost creepy. But then you've got young Boboa Fett narrating with his annoying raspy little kid's voice. ""Dad, go faster."" ""Dad, you're losing him."" ""Dad, there he goes."" 

It was like the spirit of Jake Lloyd lived on. 

It did make amends for the dumbass way Boboa dies in a few years. 

I had forgotten this, but I loved that they visited Tatooine and met Luke's aunt and uncle. It was a good moment because they were in the same room in that hut where we'll later here Obi-Wan tell Luke about the force and Darth Vader. It gave a somewhat valid reason for having Anakin go on this quest to save his mom, another character we're supposed to care about for some reason. 

And I love how Luke's theme is playing during this scene, but then seconds later we get Darth Maul's theme when Anakin is looking for his mom, like John Williams put the wrong track in.

And then, not like it matters, but Anakin's mom pulls a Yoda and conveniently dies just in time to see her son for a couple of seconds and say a few words. 

And is it just me, or does that conveyer belt scene remind you of Nick Arcade, from start to finish? A pretty fun scene in a movie that's been dry as toast. In any other movie, I would have hated it, but we've waited so long for something interesting to happen, that I'll take what I can get at this moment, with the terrible CGI and C3P0 getting his body swapped with a clone. If this whole movie has been dry toast, then this scene is like a glob of unsalted butter being plopped down onto it. 

I'll take it. 

But for fuck's sake. Did R2-D2 have to fly?

This. This, right here. This is the very first moment in the prequel trilogy that was screaming at us from the big screen back in 2001 when this came out, that George Lucas isn't taking anything that we know and love from the original trilogy, seriously. 

This is the moment when all that hardcore fandom should have died down a little bit and people could stop and see Star Wars for what it is. A silly movie. Continuity means jack shit in this saga. 

I mean, what are they going to do next? Force project their characters into major conflicts? 

I really do wish the movie started off like the execution show started off. As soon as the prisoners are tied up, the announcer wastes no time and says, ""Let the executions begin!"" But instead, we're left tied up and waiting for anything good for about an hour and a half. 

It's a good scene. Until Obi-Wan and Anakin get their light sabers. I when they're put in situations where they have to use their brains and muscles and not just rely on a lazer sword to cut their way out of everything. 

Then the clones arrive, Samuel L. Jackson kills Jengo Fett, and there's a short fight in the arena. 

I wish Peter Jackson had made his Lord of the Rings trilogy like a year or two earlier, because I feel like George Lucas could have benefitted from seeing the Battle of Hornburg in The Two Towers. That movie came out just a few months after Attack of the Clones. 

And while Two Towers definitely had its dry moments and was the weakest of the three, it made up for it with that great and epic battle that took up a huge chunk at the end. It made the wait worth it, and made the overall movie that much better. 

But in Attack of the Clones, the clones attacking isn't even the climax. It's just one short scene that just happens to exist in a movie of nothingness. Instead, the climax is Dukoo fighting . . . Master Yoda? 

That's all folks!

It just gets cartoony, and definitely played out to get a laugh more than intrigue. The one cool part, I will say thought, is when Yoda pushes his robe aside and his light saber flies to his hand. I thought that was stylish, but anyone could have done that. 

And while he's doing his Bugs Bunny tricks, Obi-Wan and Anakin are just cuddling up together on the ground in the corner. In any other action scene, they would have been right back up on their feet. 

But, you know. The script says ""Stay put."" 

I mean, what's the point of making Yoda the hero here? What does that benefit the story? I just don't get it. We don't even hear Anakin express pain from losing his hand. Remember when Luke lost his hand? Man, he was in pain!

""That's impossible!""

So where does this rank compared to The Phantom Menace? It's like my Casper vs. Hocus Pocus review. It's not a matter of which one is better. It's a matter of which one is worse. Which makes me ask the question, which one has the most unforgivable flaws? 

The Phantom Menace has two very big flaws working against it, and that's Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd. As I stated, if you take those two elements out, you're left with a decent movie.

And Attack of the Clones is The Phantom Menace, without those two flaws. But I feel like they took out the dirty pennies and replaced them with dirty quarters. Attack of the Clones has worse flaws, I think, than The Phantom Menace. And those flaws are the acting by Hayden Christianson, the script and directing by George Lucas. And there's also just no logic throughout this movie at all. Sending Anakin to protect the senator as his first mission? No. Like, that's pretty much the foundation of this movie and that foundation is nothing but rough and coarse sand that will hold nothing up. 

Natalie Portman stepped up her game, and Ewan McGregor is as charming as he's allowed to be. But there are just too many scenes that don't advance the story, and are just stale and stagnant and honestly just a terrible waste of time. 

So knowing how bad both movies are, which one at least entertained me the most? Mind you, entertainment doesn't necessarily mean fun and exciting and happy feelings. Bad movies can still entertain, even though they're bad. 

The underwater scene in The Phantom Menace entertained me, even though it was pointless. Watching Anakin and Padme roll around in the grass did not entertain me. The light saber fight with Darth Maul entertained me because there were stakes and the force walls were a good element. The light saber scenes with Dukoo did not entertain me, they annoyed me. 

Outside of the Darth Maul fight, I will say that the action scenes in Attack of the Clones are a big step up from The Phantom Menace, but if you took those out, you're left with a whole lot of nobodies doing a whole lot of nothing. 

So I shocked even myself, when I put Attack of the Clones underneath Phantom Menace, making it the worst Star Wars movie on my very short list of Star Wars films that I've reviewed. But the list will keep growing as I continue reviewing each film in the franchise leading up to the release of The Rise of Skywalker."
Why can't they just make a good Star Wars Film?
"The prequels are much maligned in some quarters and its easy to see why- They look fake and glossy, and nowhere is it as apparent as it is in Attack of the Clones. Another problem here is that this movie suffers from ""middle episode syndrome"" - the tendency of the second volume in a trilogy to feel incomplete and, as a result of that incompleteness, to fail to satisfy. Attack of the Clones takes the threadbare strands of plot introduced in The Phantom Menace and braids them together into what will eventually become the whole cloth for Revenge of the Sith. Still, despite several high-octane action sequences, this movie, more than any of the others in the entire Star Wars saga, feels orphaned and works considerably better when viewed as part of a greater epic than as a stand-alone production. It's setup without resolution, tease without consummation. But in order to watch the epic it must be seen."
"The best film in the Skywalker saga in my opinion. Plot is perfect, the world is spot on. Ewan McGregor's acting is great too. But the action scenes are the best."
"I thought it was alright, it had good action but everything else was just meh"
great under rated movie love it great romance really good acting fun story line just so much to enjoy.
"Coruscant is beautiful and multi cultural, you end up wanting to visit there. Incredible special effects, excellent ending and compelling universe. George knows how to expand and create an universe we can dive in"
Jango fett was cool.
One of the most boring star wars movies ever
Easily my least favorite prequel of the Star Wars saga. The acting flat out was awful often and the character development was cringe worthy and kinda creepy. I would still recommend this film for the full Star Wars experience.
The best pre-queal of Star Wars ever.
"A fun inclusion to the Star Wars universe, even if the dialogue wasn't brilliant."
"Some of the choices made in this movie is comparison to TPM are questionable. The only above average main characters are Obi-Wan (who is by far the best), Jango & Boba Fett and Yoda. Dooku and Windu are decent and Palpatine still isn't really worth mentioning until the next episode. The pacing is just plain weird and for most of the film's second act the story is insanely boring. Fortunately, Jar-Jar has a much less important role in this film and while he's on the screen, he's not as annoying as he used to be. The absolute lowest this movie comes is in terms of it's infamous love sub-plot between Anakin & Padmé as well as... well, let's just say, 'I don't like sand'. Literally the worst sentence to ever enter George Lucas' train of thought.

This movie is definitely saved by it's stunning visuals and everything that Obi-Wan does. I honestly reckon that if this film was half the size and purely centred around Obi-Wan it would probably be better. The clone sub-plot with Jango Fett is excellent and I appreciate seeing a bounty hunter character who isn't just 'there'. Yoda's agility and fighting style against Dooku was also a good subversion of expectations and I find it hilarious that he just goes back to the cane right after."
"This film is amazing. While sometimes boring, it has great moments. The sandstorm on Geonosis, the fight between Count Dooku and yoda. The majority of this film is packed with action, and drama. I recommend this film."
I've never laughed as hard as when I saw Yoda fighting with a Light Saber. He looked like an extremely hyped up rag doll. That was all I remembered about this film. A true insult to the original films. It's only saving grace was when the credits rolled.
Slow moving but faithful to the concepts of the franchise.  Interesting to see the story of Anakin and how he became ‘you know who'.
"It is a good Star Wars movie. Not as good as Revenge of the Sith, but still a great movie. Also, if it's not evident that Jar Jar is a Sith, I'm pretty sure Palpatine is somehow controlling him, because it is amazing seeing what George wanted so long in this movie showing Palpatine's evil side and the Senate corruption, and how Jar Jar is involved. The CGI does leave something to be desired."
"With a slow-moving plot, some real cringey screen-writing, and static characters, Attack Of The Clones is quite simply the worst Star Wars film of the Skywalker Saga. What should have been a step in the right direction after The Phantom Menace, is a disappointment even in the eyes of one of the most devoted fans such as myself. I really put some considerable effort at finishing this movie — something I never have to do when watching other Star Wars films during my spare time."
"A huge improvement on episode 1 as there's less Jar Jar. However, some of Anakin's dialogue is cringey as hell."
"While it certainly adds to the worldbuilding of the franchise, it has at its core a wooden love story and rather shaky plot development, not to mention spending far too much time on politics - which ironically still manages to fail at explaining properly the roles of the parties and how all this ties together. Credit still has to be given where its due, however, and the film does manage to further the tragedy of its central character well enough, with a healthy dose of irony on the side, but juggles way too many subplots that it ultimately becomes rather painful to sit through."
Not a good dialogue but a fun movie in the end the good visuals help a lot in this one
"There are three aspects that make Attack of the Clones work. The first is Obi Wan, or rather McGregor's interpretation of the character. No longer relegated as side character, Obi Wan is given full rein with a gutsy performance by McGregor who injects blunt and energetic traits, whilst bringing a sense of mysticism. The central character holds the film together in a way that Liam Neeson could not accomplish in the first prequel. It was without doubt that McGregor was not a good choice for such a monumental role. However, here he proves he can equal Sir Alec Guinness, whilst relishing his extended screen time. The second outstanding coup for this film is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. He is the mastermind of the Separatists, who manipulates everyone in accordance with his secret agenda. Once again Lee proves he is an expert in depicting sinister villains. His performance and screen presence adds much-needed villainy to the film and makes him a formidable opponent for the Jedi to defeat. Thirdly, special effects fans will rejoice with this latest offering. Yoda has now been given a lease of life as a digital character that moves fluidly and with grace. He is probably one of the most important characters in Lucas' Space Opera and this time around, we get to see him flex some serious Jedi muscle. The highly charged and perhaps, laughable confrontation scene between Yoda and Dooku, produces possibly one of the most memorable sequences in the entire prequel saga. This was George Lucas' wild card, which he springs on the audience in a rousing climactic finale.

Additional positive points must also go to Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), who intrigues as the ruthless no-nonsense bounty hunter. Special mention goes to John Williams, who creates arguably his best symphonic piece for a Star Wars movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. The main romantic arrangement is a haunting melody that captures the tragic and forbidden love affair of Anakin and Padme. The soundtrack represents a spellbinding amalgamation of new and old themes, which have spanned the entire saga.

Unfortunately, Episode 2 is not all good. Glaring flaws in this otherwise entertaining film do jar the experience somewhat. The pivotal love story is laboured at best. Christensen and Portman show good on-screen chemistry. Some awkward dialogue fails to ignite any emotion that exists between the two leads. Anakin's romantic gush has all the subtlety of a Wookie and will probably leave the audience cleaning out schmaltzy goo from their ears! It is at these moments when you wish that another better writer was at hand to pencil in some dialogue resembling the witty flirty exchanges between Han Solo and Princess Leia in 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Hayden Christensen is a superbly talented actor, but here he plays the teenage angst role by the book. Portman is the biggest disappointment. Despite being given a more dramatic role and ditching the monotonous vocal tones of Queen of Naboo, she still appears wooden. Lucas has a tendency to hopelessly underuse some of the acting talents on hand. Even the Emmy award winner and veteran NYPD Blue actor, Jimmy Smits, as Bail Organa, has fewer lines than Jar Jar Binks! Also, Oscar-nominated Samuel L Jackson as Jedi Master Mace Windu, says nothing much of substance again but does get to see lightsaber combat this time to please the fans.

Episode 2 still lacks the innovation of the original Star Wars, whilst failing to emulate much of the dark edgy tension of Empire (perhaps this is because we know most of the characters will survive through to the next film). However, the grandiose vision of Episode 2 does live up to the expectations associated with the saga and its relentless action guarantees a worthwhile cinematic Star Wars experience."
"With the  love scenes with creepy Anakin picking up Padme aside, this movie still has some really good action, and the introduction of the character ""Count Dooku"" alone makes it worth the watch. This is also the first time we ever see Yoda in action fighting, and it really was a great moment."
"I Love this movie, I know many regard this as the worst Star Wars, but I enjoy it."
"Wooden acting, an overabundance of effects, and more of the same in terms of boring story, this film has nothing of note to truly mention. Definitely the worst of the series."
Scope of galaxy is really felt and this start Anakin's path to darkness. He fought and hated himself after his revenge on Tuskens. Dooku and Obi Wan dialogue was awesome and also Obi Wan and jango. CGI looks excellent and I love wide documentary shots. Not like today when camera must show scene from many angles just to have something happening. Last act is best in Star wars history.
Bad dialogue. Bad chemistry. Bad CGI. but its still star wars
"One of the visible improvements is the change of Jake Lloyd by Hayden Christensen as Anakin, which brings more maturity to the plot. There's a lot more action in this installment, and the special effects are sublime, as usual."
Not as strong as the Phantom Menace it draws heavily from works like Dr. Zhivago it can be a little slow. Still it does further the adventures of Anakin Skywalker and his friend Obi-Wan Kenobi as discussed back in 1977 in the original Star Wars. A must see.
"The only good thing about this flim was the obi wan vs jango fett fight, and the jedi vs droids at the end. The love story between anakin and padme felt really odd to me. and Jango was kiled of WAY TO EARLY LIKE COME ON. I honestly could of wrote a few things a  lot better, but over all I liked the flim enough."
"The film was wasted opportunity to see create an origin for clone wars. The screenplay and the story was weak with some unnecessary subplot and bad dialogues. Some performence were great like Ewan Mcgregor and Ian Mcdairmid but other performences were horrible. The film's overuse of CGI made the film confusing. The film is also tiresome to seat through till the end with its 142 minutes runtime, the film tends to drag alot (like the romantic scenes of Anakin and Padme). The politics in the film were dull. The film does not feels like a Star Wars film but a mix of detective and dark romance. The film has some good things in it but overall the film is bad or average at best."
"Slow, dull acted, and full of plot holes, Attack of the Clones falls flat despite it's thrilling action."
It was an okay film.
The prequels do get better as they go on. Dialogue is still the main issue and overuse of CGI but still some very memorable sequences.
I hate the romantic Scene
Meh.... it set the story..
Epic huge story how sith play both sides to make war and rise of Palpatine. Jedi was unprepared to face fight and they won only because Dooku let them win so that war can continue and Palpatine get more and more power
"tar Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones benefits from an increased emphasis on thrilling action, although they're once again undercut by ponderous plot points and underdeveloped characters."
"Lucas brings us a sci fi epic, pure entertainment from the beginning to the end."
The prequel built Anakin's Character.
"Great movie and shows what happen when global power created by many different nations get army that would ensure that no one leaves union. Same with today in EU with their army. Nations should have armies, not supernational entities. Lucas was smart enough to see treat of global army."
"A slight improvement on the Phantom Menace, with some great action scenes and visuals, but the whole thing is brought down by that tedious ROMANCE. It is so bad that next time I watch it I will skip every time. Plus, Hayden Christensen is very miscast. Through, as I said, some great action and the visual effects make every set look great, particularly Kamino.  But this is still hard think this belongs in the same saga as the Empire Strikes Back."
"Love how this movie is colorful, not like disney's fan fiction where is all grey. If peoples try to understand plot, this movie woild be their favorite. CGI looks awesome and Corridor Crew showed that in their video. Geonosys, Coruscant, Kamino and clone army in action looks great and feel great. Finally many Jedi in screen in battle."
"Horrible writing, directing and acting. GARBAGE!!!"
Great movie and continuation of great adventure that ep1 started.
"Nothing bad about this movie
Galaxy was great, Palpatine was awesome, Jedi hiding informations from senate how their ability to use force diminish, Many jedi in action and huge ground battle.
Sith mastefully create conflict and forced republic to use army that Jedi think its was made by Jedi master Sifo Dyas. If they didn't use army, separatist would defeat Jedi so republic was never left with much choices.
Anakin acted as anyone in his years wouild if was raised in temple by monks who teach no family or attachments
Hayden is unsung hero because no one else would be able to play Anakin so well."
"Everyone says The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie. No, attack of the clones is the worst in my book. The CGI in this movie is awful; its so horrifically noticeable, and it just looks unappealing. The acting (oh lord) is also really bad, but i dont blame the actors. I blame the hilariocity that is the script. Everything that comes out of their mouths sounds incredibly stupid and cheesy. The chemistry between anakin and padme was about as convincing as pizza and grape jelly going together. Exactly, there is no chemistry. And anakin annoyed the living shit out of me in this movie by being an entitled and ungrateful brat for the entire runtime. Honest to god, i want to like this movie, but i cant"
"Zero stars
Give up! This trilogy is a disaster!"
"A fantastic adventure into a galaxy far, far away, combined with Lucas's direction, the script he co-wrote with Hales, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Tattersall's cinematography, Burtt's editing, Bocquet's production, Walpole's set decoration, Biggar's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Attack Of The Clones is a fun and rousing Star Wars adventure!"
By far the worst Star Wars film of the Skywalker saga. Christensen and Portman have about as much chemistry as a celery and a rubber duck. Just don't watch this movie. 1/10.
"""Attack of the Clones"" passes because of Ewan McGregor's performance and visually thrilling action sequences, but with a built-in audience, it could have strived for more than lackluster dialogue and ridiculous plot development with a dreadful romance between Padme and Anakin."
It's a good Star Wars movie but the Anakin and Padmé scenes are ruining the whole movie
"Attack of the Clones is slightly better than The Phantom Menace, but it's still not a great film. Hayden Christensen is well-cast as Anakin, the problem is his dialogue and the way George Lucas directs him. The romance in this movie is awful. Anakin and Padme have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. While this movie has plenty of flaws, there is some really good action in it, including Obi-Wan's fight against Jango Fett and the Battle of Geonosis. Also, Christopher Lee is incredible as Count Dooku. B- 65/100"
"Decent, but i love jango fett!"
This movie was horrible it was boring the characters were uninteresting and if people think the phantom menace was bad this is worse!!! PS CGI sucked
Their are some glaring plot points that down right confusing.
Attack of the Clones has it moments but overall this is not a good movie. The script is absolutely terrible and the visuals don't hold up either. Like i said it has some good scenes like in the Arena but that's about it.
Some bad parts but overall enjoyable.
Phenomenal set up for the major events of the Clone Wars with impactful develt for Anakin that sets up his development and grows the world building to a major scale
I don't like Sand
The weakest movie out of the weakest trilogy.
"This was a good film with an amazing storyline. I really liked how the film has fast paced actions sequences mixed in with a great plot. A negative was how Anakins character was mishandled. He wasn't a character that you would be attached to as he was always whiny. Anakin should have been more Jedi like. The connection between him and Obi wan should have been stronger. The Romance in the story was at some points cringe but overall it wasn't terrible. The music was amazing and the scene with Anakin experiencing the dark side for the first time could not have been better. I just wish it was longer. This movie had the most potential out of any Star Wars movie as this was the time where the Jedi were at their highest peak, Anakin and Obi Wan side by side, Anakin's romance with Padme, Anakins first time experiencing the dark side, The start of the Clone Wars and so much more. Anakin was a character that had loads and loads of potential but fell flat. It wasn't a bad movie by any means but just missed out on certain aspects that would have made this movie potentially legendary!  I rated this movie as a good movie despite the missed opportunities because it delivered on its action packed scenes. The villains in this movie were good and the mystery and suspense was greatly portrayed. This movie was a good movie and was on par with a Star Wars movie but it had Great potential with the characters that the movie simply missed out on."
"While the first film was a disappointment at least it was a little fun. This film tries to be more serious in tone, but comes across as boring and dull. The first and last acts are a lot of fun and action packed, but the middle drags and feels longer than it actually is. McGregor, Jackson, Oz, Morrison, and Lee are the best performers in the film, the effects are good but feel more dated even compared to the first film. Christiansen is really disappointing as Anakin, sometimes he feels like he's doing a good job the rest, well let's just say he doesn't like sand. Portman feels like she's phoning it in but is still being professional about it. All in all the film is a lot like Episode I, it has its moments but overall underwhelming."
Although this film has less jar jar it still suffers from terrible performances especially from Hayden Christensen a terrible story that makes little to no sense and even worse dialogue and even though the fight scenes are better with the exception of Yoda versus count dooku I believe that this film is worse then the phantom menace and gets a 3/10
The Young Indiana Jones tv series should have been the warning where this Star Wars film was going to go. Ewan McGregor as always a bad casting decision.
"People usually say this is a better movie than Ep 1, I'm inclined to disagree, this is the worst movie in the entire franchise in my honest opinion."
"Definitely not the greatest in this immensely good saga, but it adds on the lore in a pretty efficient way. I'll try to remain spoiler free. Aside from the pretty poorly handled romance and the dialogues with Anakin in general, plus some dumb moments like the ""Arena"" with the three monsters, we have an overall pretty well crafted scenario. We have our first all-out fight with Jedis, witness the creation of an army able to match the droids in terms of number (and which outmatches it in terms of efficiency), and see the main characters grow a bit. The main antagonist of the saga starts putting his plan into place, while letting the protagonists fight a much more visible ennemy. Lucas manage to make his main story advance slowly while entertaining us with enough action and drama to keep us interested."
Lucas masterfully created new universe not like Star Wars of today that was buildt only of nostalgia. Lucas had this story long in his mind and he has done his wish filming them. Awesome work.
What has Lucas done to Star Wars?! Is he just adding more to this franchise that does not relate to the original trilogy?
"While certainly lacking a deeper character development, this film continues the Star Wars saga with new interesting characters, a nice plot full of action and intrigue, an amazing soundtrack, and superb visual effects."
Middle of story Lucas always wanted to tell. Most plot heavy movie of all SW and marks Palpatine rise to power with emergency powers as point of no return. Blindness and arrogance of Jedi etc...This movie because of story was far most important than entire OT
"Great action and interesting detective story on the one side and cheesy love story on the other. Some 
overuse of cgi, bad acting and overly dramatic romantic plot might deter people from the otherwise solid story."
"This film plods along. Not with a good pace, but so many obstacles trying to divert your attention. So, what do we got. We know whose behind the plot at the beginning. As if we needed that for the running time. We are given a love story. Which is torture to watch. We are given real life people in front of digital artists, and it looks very dumb. It goes for over two hours and twenty minutes of actors delivery of lines. It seemed like they had an idea and ran with it. But they didn't focus on any of that. They shot it quickly and I think it was left for digital artists only. There was probably a good twenty minutes of fight scenes, and no one else. The protagonist, you basically wanted him to shut up. But, all in all, half was good, half was bad, and none of the jokes landed. I would have to say, this is the worst out of the franchise. Some say Episode 1 is bad. But 2? I would have rather watch the pod race scene than any of the dialogue with Padme and Anakin any day."
"The action is better and Lucas's team learned from their overuse of comic relief, yet the seemingly-lazy dialogue falls flat, spoiling a love story that already feels forced."
"Don't get me wrong I like the prequels but this is easily the worst out of them.  There are good parts to this movie and really bad parts.  For starters the romance between Anakin and Padme is awfully acted but to be fair no one could make the bad dialogue work; there is little to no chemistry between them and they take up the majority of the film.  Hayden Christensen at the start of the movie wasn't as bad as I remembered him, he actually reminded me of Anakin Skywalker with some of his lines like, ""You know me master I couldn't find a speeder I really liked,""  but as soon as he and Padme got to Naboo I remembered why he was so bad.  On the other hand Obi-Wan's side of the story is actually really entertaining and if the entire movie was devoted to this I would have liked it a whole lot more, Obi-Wan even meets Jango Fett one of the coolest characters in the entire Star Wars galaxy.  The final battle where all of the heroes are on Geonosis is very fun and as a kid it was the part of the film that I lived for.  Star Wars Episode II, Attack Of The Clones is still a mixed bag for me but I did enjoy it more than I did the last time I watched it."
People don’t understand the complicity of this movie and thats why they don’t like it. But once you do it will probably turn into your favorite star wars movie
"Along with ep1, only movie that looks like Old Republic. Seeing many jedi is something i wanted since i learned about Star Wars. Slave ! was awesome ship and asteroid scene was one of best ever in movie history"
I slaughtered them like animals
Best final act of all Star Wars. Anakin on Tatooine again and Obi wan on Kamino was great buildup for story and characters.
Fell asleep halfway through
CGI was insane for that age and still hold today. Plot of Palpatine being puppet master and Anakin first step into darkness was excellent made.
"Best buildup for ending and finale was just awesome. 
Jango Fett and Obi Wan fight and chase scene is best visual and sound experience in all of Star wars"
The film does a good job setting up the main plot that leads to the original trilogy. The middle of the film feels a bit sappy with the romance but the last sequence of the film more than makes up for it.
"I watched this movie last night. I remember it being really bad but after watching through the whole prequel trilogy again, a lot of the acting and plot makes sense. I think Hayden Christensan as Anakin Skywalker was able to play the torn Jedi Padawan really well and made the entire experience quite fun."
"Easily the worst Star Wars movie. Period. The CGI aged horribly, the acting is pretty bad (especially Hayden Christensen), its story is very confusing and of course the romance between Anakin and Padme is one of the worst love stories ever. The only good thing is the Jedi Battle in Geonosis, that scene elevates the movie a bit for me. But i would say stay away from this movie; this is a kick in the balls for Star Wars fans...

5/100"
"Since Palpatine is in office, republic is like dictatorship and Palpatine said that he won't allow that republic split into two making fertile groung for war. Separatist build their army and Palpatine and Dooku created Clone army and  hide locfation of Kamino till time come when Jedi won't have option and will have to use clone army Dooku created. Jedi didn't have reason to be suspicious to Clone army too much because as Obi Wan told them, Jedi master Sifo Dyas ordered that army for republic and that army was only thing that could help them to won against separatist. Also Jedi went on Geonsis to stop Dooku and separatist alliance. Dooku ordered Tusken raiders to kidnapp Anakin's mother so that Anakin have his premonitions and knowsomething is wrong and Jedi didn't allow him to see what is wrong.Jedi are responsible for Anakin first step into darkness when he killed entire tribe of tuskens.

I loved many Jedi in action, and ground fight on Geonosys. It actually shows that Jedi have not fought war in thousand years and are unprepared. Sith never planned to attack them head on but to turn republic from inside and make that republic hate them. 
Coruscant and Kamino and Geonosys were all extremly well created places.
Fight and chase scene between Obi wan and Jango was awesome and Slave 1 showed that its superb ship.
Clone army marching in their ships and going on battlefields across galaxy was excellent scene showing that there is no turning back. Palpatine has done what he has planned.ï»¿"
"Good actors, good music, bad plot. It was filled with unnecessary romance talk and cheap deaths."
"without the cringe romance from Hayden Christensen It's a great, fun film. the CGI was pushed to much is many scenes but the whole Clone's and Jango Fett left me happy"
"While it's much better paced than The Phantom Menace, and boasts (slightly) better effects, Attack of the Clones still fails due to extremely poor characterization and dialogue. None of this is any more true than with the romance between Anakin and Padme."
"This is now the 4th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones and for some reason I forgot how bad it really was.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones Is the 5th Star Wars film and the 2nd Star Wars prequel. The film was directed by George Lucas the same man who once directed A New Hope (wha thappened). The film stars Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker and Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The acting is some of the worst in the Star Wars universe from the emotion to the dialogue delivery. The only person in the entire film who I felt fit their role was Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.

The characters/character arcs are also some of the worst within the Star Wars universe from teenager Anakin to Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala. The only character that wasn't a complete train wreck in my opinion was Count Dooku.

The cinematography was steady with a cool shot here and there, but like Phantom Menace nothing special.

The settings are also some of the worst and most bland from the Star Wars universe that I have ever seen. 

The set designs, props, and costumes are strong, but even if it was the best set and costume designs ever it would still be one of the worst films ever made.

The special effects are extremely dated and are some of the most unpleasant effects to look upon.

The action is weak throughout nearly the entire movie from the effects to the cinematography. The only fight that didn't make me feel sick was the first half of the final fight with Anakin and Dooku.

The music was the only thing that kept me alive whilst watching the movie. I just want to thank John Williams for his amazing skill that even works with an atrocious film like this.

The story in my opinion was really bland and super uninteresting. 

The comedy is also some of the worst that Star Wars have ever done. Not once did I laugh and to make things worse I didn't just dislike the comedy, I hated it.

Also For some reason the film has a budget of $120,000,000. How the hell did this film get a budget of $120,000,000.

The film is also one of the most boring films that I have ever seen.

Over all I give it a 
1/10

"This movie is complete garbage. I cannot think of a single good thing about this movie, I hate that this is a real part of this franchise and an important part too. A very bad film."
"Focuses too much on a love story with almost no chemistry. Actors need direction but don't get any. A lot of wasted potential among a multitude of actors and stories that could be told. The final action sequence is well choreographed enough as to not be boring but is mostly dumb if the viewer thinks about it for more than a second. The main plot and subplot are both incredibly boring, luckily John Williams' music is there for you to still feel comfortable and enjoy the movie enough."
"By far the weakest movie in the “Star Wars” franchise, Episode II had potential that was sadly overshadowed by awkward writing and performances, as well as too much of a dependency on CGI."
I don't like sand... or this movie.
"The romance. It's so often criticised, and I can understand why of course. This is not a very normal romance.
But I think, maybe, a gut feeling, that Lucas was deliberately intending for this romance to feel a bit weird and unusual. 
These are two people who absolutely know they shouldnt be getting intinate with each other. Anakin clearly does feel a strong attachment to Padme and Padme for a while sorts of fights off these advances but doesn't turn away completely, proving to Anakin that she also feels some sort of attachment to him.
The key scene is the one where Anakin reveals that he killed the Tuskens, including children and women. Padme actually  feels even more attached to Anakin after this and, sort of confirms to the audience what a flawed and dangerous relationship this is. Padme is drawn into Anakins heart by his darker personality and she must know that. 
Love is very powerful and it can come about in strange a surprising ways.
Fans might not like the acting, may not like the tone or the actors, but this is really not a farfetched romance as depicted in this film. Vader didn't just become Vader, it was a process that actually erupts to another level once Padme embraces him for his darker side."
Master Yoda fighting for the first time in Star Wars saga! His fight vs Dooku is legendary.
Tied with I for stinkiness and horrible name
"second worst Episode after The last Jedi. just the fight of Geonosis is enjoyable, the rest is either boring or awkward. At least it extended the Star Wars Saga to some degree."
One of the lesser episodes of the saga. Dull and a boring. I wish the acting was more appealing for one of the best villains in history.
Great Film. I love the prquels
I don't like sand.
One of the better Star wars films.
"A slight improvement over its predecessor, though poorly named, this installment simply expands and convolutes Episode I's directionless storytelling, obsession with spectacle, and cardboard characters. It features one of the worst love-stories of all time, that even an actor of Natalie Portman's talent is incapable of saving. There's no need to watch this movie - it would be best for someone to familiarize themselves with it by reading the plot summary on Wikipedia."
Exciting and amusing. The romance between Anakin and Padme was a struggle to watch but the Jedi doing their thing and the rising tension and start of the Clone Wars was like watching history. Really liked it.
was a good film and would watch it again the newer one i was mad at what i saw
This movie is slightly better than The Phantom Menace. That doesn't say much. This movie is still a terrible borefest. Don't even get me started on the horrible nonsensical storytelling and awful acting. Grade: D
"Convoluted plot and cartoony physics, Attack of the Clones ties The Last Jedi as my least liked Star Wars film."
"Sceneggiatura discreta. Recitazione discreta. Sceneggiatura discreta. Colonna sonora ottima. Voto: 7,5"
I wished that this could’ve been better but it wasn’t that bad
"This movie deserves more love, it's not on par with the others but it's not as bad as many say."
"Absolutely better than Episode 1, 7, and 8. The dialogue made me cringe at parts but Jango Fett was pretty cool until he gets his head cutt off in front of his clone son Bobba Fett."
I'm not supposed to be this bored watching Star Wars. Williams elevates it a usual though.
Only gets better with age
not bad needed a better screen play got worse rating because of how bad episode I was
"Attack of the Clones had some great action scenes and creative ideas, but worsened the dialogue, script, and especially acting, causing the Star Wars universe to change in a weird way."
Me encanto muy buena unos fallos pero cuentan algo que siempre quise ver.
"This movie gets too much hate, I liked the prequels."
"Spielberg goes crazy with CGI and you get ""Jurassic Park.""  Lucas goes crazy with CGI and you get this.  Gimme Spielberg's any day. =)"
The 2nd entry of the Star Wars prequel Trilogy is better than the last film.
"Compared to TLJ, best movie ever."
Star Wars: Attack of the Clones stifles the growing darkness inside Anakin Skywalker with abysmal writing and an overreliance on CGI effects in many questionable places.
"Not the best, but watchable"
"Least favorite of the prequel movies too little detail and time spent on the Clone War, would have liked to see a sub trilogy on this between this and the third movie, Haden hadn't gotten that comfortable in the role."
It's george lucas' star wars. What more to say.
This movie would remind Anakin of home.
Worst star wars movie ever
"While this movie has it's boring moments, the final act makes up for all of it"
Average summer blockbuster
Love everything about it. Has a few bad moments but if your willing to look past them itâ(TM)s an amazing well made film.
If you skip the moments in Naboo it's actually decent and enjoyable movie. It could use a remake for the CGI it's not the best
Space detective Obi Wan it's one of the few good things in the movie. If you delete the romance would be an 8
"My face sci-fi film
The story showed to the folly of trusting a political side and fighting for it without fixing it's horrid elements, because in the deep dark corners of war someone is playing us all.
It also showed us the lore of Star wars across several worlds and factions. It had wondrous battles, a curious mystery and epic music! The love story was only slightly ruined by the slightly stiff acting of Anakin ."
"Being less enjoyably bad than Episode I did Episode II no favors. The romantic dialogue is awful, and the lore is never explored enough to really justify its existence."
"Attack of the clones has an impressive plot ,with impressive action sequences . But the original trilogy remains far superior."
"not bad
acting was alright
pacing can feel very slow at times
great battle scenes
graphics can look wonky at times"
Uhhh... Who fails to recognise a spoiled brat when they see one? Not enjoyable.
"great movie, underrated"
"Some good scenes, but they are overshadowed by terrible dialogue and boring exposition."
"It's the worst Star Wars prequel movie, but it's not the worst Star Wars movie. That title belongs to TLJ. Attack of the Clones has good action toward the end, so if you were to watch it for some apparent reason for the first time, skip to like the last thirty minutes of the movie."
My favorite star wars
"just an average film, not very good not very bad. It has star wars charm and is a good popcorn flick"
"This film was hit and miss, but over time, it has grown on me, to where it's become a lot of fun to watch. I feel that people need to give this movie another shot."
"Well, not really good but still far better than The Last Jedi. That's for sure."
"Many people disliked this for the wrong reasons I think.  I absolutely loved this film.  I acknowledge some ackward moments and dry acting, but I really enjoyed the story itself. Anakin coming of age, and falling in love with the girl he met years ago. The pain of missing his mother, only to go back home to find her at the moment she dies. To vow that he would never let something like that happen again which leads to his love and protection of Padme, who he marries.  The love story element really added a whole new depth to things, and I absolutely loved it because you can see how Anakin was always doing things out of protecting those he loved in fear of losing them. Also the rise of power of palpatine who was the mastermind playing both sides in the start of the clone wars.  If you look past some of the moments of dry acting, you can really enjoy this film. Wish it got better reviews overall. Also, visuals were great, new characters were interesting, and really set up for anticipation for the next film."
"It's goofy and it's flashy. It's dialogue falls flat and emotion is badly written. But the world it's written in seemed interesting. I like this film. Its not a well written script but the interesting planets, weapons and people and sound editing are lovely.  For children it's perfect. For adults it's mediocre."
"Great movie, very very underrated. I loved seeing all the Jedi in battle including Yoda for the first time ever."
"Despite being a huge fan of the franchise, this did not tick any of my boxes apart from the (expected) jedi fights and character development of Anakin Skywalker!"
"George Lucus delivers the second installment in the STAR WARS prequel series. ATTACK OF THE CLONES carries on from where THE PHANTOM MENACE left off, and once again delivers. Action, thrills, all-out war and Jedi lightsaber duels are all part of the deal. Not happy? I sure as hell am."
"Overall plot is fairly well thought out and developed. However, poor dialogue and some stilted performances detracts from the overall result."
Should've followed through with the darth jar jar storyline would've made the movie better than what we got
Where did Dooku come from.  Shoved in there to account for the void left when the true plans for Jar Jar the Sith were scrapped.  You fucked up.  Should have stuck to the plan.
"In short, this movie is not a very good movie. It has great ideas, but the time management of these ideas and the execution of almost everything makes this one of the worst, if not the worst, Star Wars film ever made. 

First in this movie, the directors begin to move in the right direction in attempting to fix their mistakes in Episode 1 regarding one specific character, Jar Jar Binks. He has a much smaller role in this movie, but in my opinion, they did not go far enough. Thankfully, they rectified this later in Episode 3 by having only one scene with Jar Jar.

Next, the time management in this movie is terrible. They spend much too long focusing on the love story between Anakin and Padme. This would be fine if Star Wars was a franchise about love stories. But I want to see exploding ships and huge space battles, much like the rest of the audience. Also, they only allot a very small amount of time to show the clones in action, despite it being called ""Attack of the Clones."" I would have much rather seen more battles in this movie involving the clones than just the one on Geonosis.

The overall plot of this movie is pretty good, and when you think back to the lore created by it while watching later or earlier movies, you can appreciate it. The backstory for the clones was developed well and when they were actually fighting, I liked it. But because of the execution of what would be good ideas, I have to score it badly."
I love Anakin Skywalker this film is a 5 star movie
Big Man says this is the best series ever! 5/5
"Even if this movie is considered bad and it had many flaws, it's still a gem compared to the Disney trash, namely TLJ. The lightsaber duels are amazingly choreographed and the movie respects the general in-universe lore (unlike the sequel trilogy) and does not feel like a blatant cashgrab. Also the meme factor and the fact that this movie has the cheesy feeling to it makes it worth a watch in my eyes. 

Also we find out the fact that will be crucial to the SW universe in general: Anakin does not like sand. 

#boostThePrequelRatings"
"This movie is not objectively good but itâ(TM)s far from âterribleâ? or bad in my opinion. The big issue is the romance, and rightfully so, as Amidala and Skywalker donâ(TM)t have much chemistry in most of their scenes. The dialogue given to them is quite clunky and the romance suffers more as a result. However, I did like some scenes with them such as their debate upon politics and how the system should work: I thought the dialogue was decent and both actors had chemistry that I wish was prevalent in the main scenes. A issue that bugs me more than the romance is the overload of CGI, as it really dates the picture. Seriously this movie looks like it was filmed solely in front of a blue screen, and itâ(TM)s a bit distracting for normal conversations to look off. The usage of CGI is fine, and can help simplify the work, but it should be used only when its absolutely necessary. This is far from the end of problems for Attack Of The Clones, but I like to do the unpopular gesture of praising this movie for its merits. I felt that the cast choice was fantastic, with Samuel Jackson, Christopher Lee, Ewan Mcgregor and Natalie Portman. Of all the aforementioned actors Mcgregor steals the show as a near perfect Obi Wan Kenobi, despite having often clunky dialogue. Christopher Lee is good for being Christopher Lee but Count Dooku is probably the least intriguing villain of the franchise up to this point, which is a shame. Samuel Jackson does a good job but his character just sits on his ass throughout the entire movie, which becomes tedious to see after a while. Natalie Portman is a fantastic actress but she is hampered here by poor writing as previously stated, although she does bring a sense of charm to the role and is good when she is partaking in the role of Han Solo, and is a great role model for girls in this film. I also will politely mention that she is by far the most beautiful woman in the Saga, and for that alone I will give her a pass. Hayden Christensen is great when acting facially, but is cringe worthy in most scenes, which is unfortunate because I think he is truly a great actor. The third act of the movie is what the rest should have been and reminded me of the excitement of the Original Trilogy, despite the dated bluescreen. Overall, AOTC is not bad but it suffers from many flaws that barely make it better that Episode 1."
THE GREATest film of all time
Trash with cool characters
"In terms of story better than episode 1, nice feel to the larger scale battle"
"Attack of the Clones amazing world-building and original design is overwhelmed and shadowed by its cringeworthy dialogues and out-of-place scenes, but is otherwise a decently entertaining movie if understood under the scope of being just the second entry on a 6-movie storyline."
"It's the worst movie of the Prequels, maybe the entire saga. The writing was horrible and the actors make it worse. The CGI is the worst of the prequels too. There are some good parts like Ian McDiarmids acting and John Williams score. Also I believe Yoda was great too!"
"And I thought Star Wars couldn’t get worse after the Phantom Menace. This movie was even worse than the last one. The only redeemable qualities were Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid, and Samuel L Jackson. Anything to do with Anakin and Padme made me want to claw my eyes out. The lightsaber duel was a huge letdown after the admittedly awesome Duel of the Fates. All I can say is at least things got better after this mess."
Interesting but badly done.
2nd worst SW film. Lucky for Clones TLJ took that crown.
"i love this film, its amazing  i dont care what people say about the love stuff in this film, i thought it developed anakins character more, this film is amazing the action was fucking awesome and the cgi improved with jar jar over the previous film im going to give star wars attack of the clones a 5 out of 5 star grade, i love this film, i love the star wars saga and i hate what disney is doing to george lucas's baby, also that duel between yoda and count dooku is amazing"
"The weakest of the saga, but still it's star wars."
Still not good. But better than its predecessor.
One of my least favorite Star Wars movies
A fitting sequel to a rocky start of a trilogy.
good duels but not a fan of the poor acting or stalky anakin.
Just such a boring movie.
A Boring Prequel With Some Great Action Sequences
"The weakest of the prequels, but still good Star Wars fun for the family. My youngest son adores it. And it does move the story along and gets all of the characters into place."
"If you thought Phantom Menace was the worst Star Wars movie, just wait til' you see this"
Nothing else to add that hasn't been said.
"The second installment in George Lucas' prequels suffers from the same flaws as the first, and perhaps a little more. Once again giving us wondrous and colorful images, though still suffocating us with excessive video game level CGI, and once again delivering a barrage of trite, tin eared dialogue and stiff acting that would make a cardboard cutout more lively than any of these characters. It earns points over ""The Phantom Menace"" for attempting to create a more darker tone, but with so many spots where we find ourselves more bored than enthralled, and giving us perhaps one of the most juvenile romances in cinema history, as a whole, it's another swing and a miss."
"MY GOD WAS THIS MOVIE PAINFUL! Skip, Go from Movie one to Movie 3. Youll be happy with the 2 hours of your life not wasted."
Best movie of the saga. Attack of the clones itâ(TM)s my favorite movie of all time
"The second installment in George Lucas' prequels suffers just the same as ""Phantom Menace."" Lucas phones in directing to focus more time on his CGI smothered world that looks as if you're watching a video game. The film also unsurprisingly suffers from unspeakable dialogue that seems to attempt Shakespearean status but falls incredibly short, sounding stiff and makes tinnitus sound more welcoming to the ears. Which of course results in even more stiff acting and is the film presents arguably the worse on screen romance in recent memory. Like ""Menace,"" it has it's fair share of moments with beautiful images, and the added darkness is welcoming, but it also falls short by being a bit of a bore. Seems that Lucas was using this installment as a simple filler, having no idea which direction to take the story."
An improvement from the first one.
I love this movie all the more after seeing the last jedi
"Sadly, as a Star Wars fan, this is my least favorite Star Wars movie out of all the films.  Yes it doesn't have Jar Jar, yes they don't have as much Political squabble, but instead, Attack of the Clones has some of the Cringe worthy romantic dialog i have ever heard in a Star Wars movie, along with an over use of CGI and the worst of all the lightsaber battles!  A D+ is the best i can give this movie."
"A very bad narrative to drive this poor plot, with a horrible reltionship with bad acting and bad dialogues. And the CGI is not good either, it makes the action less exiting."
Nice but too slow in some scenes
Most likely the weakest film in Lucas' prequel trilogy. A good performance by McGregor and wonderful special effects just make this film serviceable.
"Se pensavate che La Minaccia Fantasma fosse il peggior film di Star Wars... beh, questo per me è ancora peggio. Il peggior film della saga in assoluto, perché non solo è mal fatto, con CGI sovrabbondante, storia incomprensibile e banale, ma ha anche l'elemento peggiore che un film d'intrattenimento può dare: la noia. Questo capitolo è terribilmente noioso, con una sceneggiatura che definire annacquata è un eufemismo, protagonisti insopportabili, dialoghi al limite del ridicolo e non una singola scena che ci si ricordi positivamente. La sensazione alla fine del film è quella di aver contemplato il nulla per due ore, e a niente vale purtroppo la presenza del Conte Dooku, un sacrificatissimo Christopher Lee in uno dei ruoli meno memorabili della sua carriera. Insomma, togliendo la nostalgia e l'affezione che si può avere per la trilogia prequel, 8e togliendo anche l'esistenza di materiale ben più raccapricciante come lo Star Wars Holiday Special), questo è veramente toccare il fondo."
"The score by John Williams is the best part of Attack of the Clones. The movie itself is just all over the place and does not seem to know what it wants to do with itself. Anakin is more of a complaining teenager than a powerful young Jedi in training, and the plot is always filled with several different things that need to be resolved. Easily the worst of the Lucas-era Star Wars movies."
"Worst one from the prequels but still got some great scenes, yoda fighting being one"
I don’t like sand...but I like the special effects
I don't like sand that says it all
"While it's much better paced than The Phantom Menace, and boasts (slightly) better effects, Attack of the Clones still fails due to extremely poor characterization and dialogue. None of this is any more true than with the romance between Anakin and Padme.

4/10"
Hayden was perfect for Anakin yes there are some questionable scenes but no movie is perfect very underrated
Just because Jango Fett and Mace Windu are decent characters doesnt mean the rest of the movie is.
"I didn't mind this, I like Jedi unlike some. Saber fight could of lasted longer."
"If you're not a fan of Star Wars, you definitely will want to skip this one. Definitely the worst in the entire Star Wars movie collection (Until ep 7) That being said there are still some good to be found in this movie. Ewan Mcgregor as Obi Wan is once again a highlight in this Star Wars Prequel."
Loved it as a child and still do.
"Though the love scenes can become tiresome, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones makes up for it by offering amazing battles, awesome villains, and the ever-powerful army of the clones."
"Worst live-action Star Wars movie. Even worse than Episode I. Episode II suffers from very wooden acting, terrible directing, awful writing, some bad casting, dreadful romance, horrible dialogue, horrific CGI, overused CGI, an over-reliance on visual effects, and a misleading title. Attack of the Clones is set 10 years after The Phantom Menace, but Obi-Wan, Padme, and Windu all look like they've only aged by 3 years. In this movie, Anakin gets recast and is played by Hayden Christensen who did not look like an older version of Jake Lloyd. The prequel trilogy really should have started out with Hayden Christensen as a 15 or 16-year-old Anakin since Episode I.
 It would've made the continuity a lot better. In this movie, all Anakin mostly does is whine and complain about his master Obi-Wan behind his back and talks badly of him behind his back. Anakin is an arrogant, creepy, weird, angst, stubborn, spoiled, bratty, whiny, annoying, immature, impatient, impulsive, ungrateful, and unlikable 19-year-old teenage prick. Padme is a cute, adorable, beautiful, lovely, sexy, sweet, sugary, kind, considerate, warm-hearted, and good-natured 24-year-old woman. One of the biggest things that annoyed me was that she left that annoying, brainless Jar Jar Binks in charge to choose who to grant the emergency power of the Galactic Senate. Much later in the film, he ends up granting Chancellor Palpatine the emergency power of the Galactic Senate.
 So a worthless, stupid, cartoonish annoying, unfunny, racist, slapstick character is the reason for the Galactic Civil War in the original trilogy? (sighs) Oh, and it's revealed in this movie that Anakin doesn't like sand, because according to him ""it's course, rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere"". So Darth Vader's weakness is sand? Is that why Darth Vader wasn't on Tattooine in Episode IV? (sighs) That is just so stupid.
 He literally blatantly tells Padme that when they're on Naboo and she just looks at him like he is the biggest and creepiest weirdo in the galaxy. Anakin is actually so creepy in this movie. Right after his mother dies from being hurt to death by the sand people, he gets angry and avenges his mother's death by slaughtering the sand people that killed her. He even takes his anger out on all the other Tusken Raiders in the village by slaughtering ALL of them including the ones that didn't even hurt, touch, nor kill his mother. He even killed ""the women and the children too"" according to him.
 The next morning, he brings his mother's dead corpse home and Padme sees him carrying the corpse. He admits to murdering all of the Tusken Raiders in the village to Padme. He even admits to her that he even murdered ""not just the men, but the women and the children too"". Padme acts like it's normal and not sociopathic for someone to take their anger out on women and children that weren't involved in killing by murdering them. She responds to him by telling him ""to be angry is to be human"".
 Anakin basically revealed himself as a sociopath in front of Padme and SHE STILL FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM. How does she fall in love with a whiny, strange, creepy sociopath like him? Anakin and Padme's romance is creepy, awkward, horrible, cringe-worthy, horribly executed, and extremely forced. This movie has one of the worst and most forced love stories ever. It's actually an even worse love story than Twilight.
 What makes it even worse is that Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have ZERO chemistry in this film. The acting from Christensen and Portman is terrible (not that I blame them, cause it's really Lucas' fault cause of his shitty writing, shitty direction, terrible script, and wooden dialogue). The characters are so poorly written. Another big flaw in this movie that I'd like to point out is that almost every single scene in this movie was filmed using blue screens, and it's painfully obvious too. There is a HUGE continuity error in Episode II. Boba Fett is Polynesian in this prequel.
 Why is young Boba Fett Polynesian? Boba Fett who was physically played by Jeremy Bulloch (who is white) and voiced by Jason Wingreen, was Caucasian and spoke with an American accent in the Star Wars originals, but in this prequel he is Polynesian and speaks with a New Zealander accent. This makes ABSOLUTE ZERO SENSE! Jango Fett should have also been Caucasian in this film. Why did George Lucas cast Daniel Logan as Boba Fett in Attack of the Clones?
 Daniel Logan was severely miscast as Boba Fett and Temeura Morrison was miscast as Jango Fett. George Lucas should have cast a Caucasian American man to play Jango Fett and a Caucasian American boy to play Boba Fett in Attack of the Clones. Also, Boba Fett should not have been a clone in this film. It makes the character feel a LOT less special and ruins his character. Boba should've been Jango's biological son instead of a clone.
 Speaking of clones, why did Lucas make all of the clone troopers CGI instead of getting actual people to play them? The CGI didn't even look good, it looked so fake-looking and horrible. The clone troopers all looked like video game characters. Speaking of video games, the battle of Geonosis scene looked like one big GIGANTIC VIDEO GAME ACTION SEQUENCE. The visuals have aged HORRIBLY.
 The CGI is almost as bad as the CGI in Spy Kids 3: Game Over. In the third act, what the hell was with Yoda using a lightsaber? How was he using a lightsaber and jumping high and far and quickly doing flips in the air when he was in a lightsaber duel against Count Dooku? Isn't Yoda supposed to be physically handicapped and slow because he is extremely super ultra old and is probably the oldest living being in the galaxy? Isn't that why he usually uses a cane?
 In the originals, he was only a Force user and is only a master of the Force. He never used a lightsaber in the originals. So what was the point of Yoda using a cane to walk if he's agile and able to move quickly on his feet and jump high and do flips in the air and is a master of using a lightsaber? Yoda is supposed to be this old, wise master who guides and teaches others and is not a fighter. Much earlier in the film, Anakin even says that Obi-Wan ""is as wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu"".
 This movie is so bad and has aged horribly. The only good things about this movie were the action, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine, and Christopher Lee as Count Tyrannus Dooku. Those three actors still managed to give pretty good performances with the lousy direction and messy script Lucas wrote. Why is the movie titled 'Attack of the Clones' if the clones only start attacking in the last 10 to 15 minutes of the final act of the movie? It should've been titled ""Shroud of the Dark Side"" (as Yoda says at the end of the movie).
 Star Wars: Episode II - Shroud of the Dark Side would have been the perfect title for this film. George Lucas ruined Anakin Skywalker, Boba Fett, and Yoda.

Rating: 4.4/10"
"This film overall had so much potential and had all the right pieces but the pacing and lack of good acting and dialogue, film falls short as an epic second piece to the prequel trilogy."
Has some boring moments but overall good movie
"This is where I wanted the prequels to begin. The ""clone wars"" went in a different direction then I expected. The anikin/padme romance was a bit juvenile and I trouble believing it. This film has the best action scenes of the three prequel movies."
"Star Wars Episode II:Attack Of The Clones is better than the Phantom Menace because it is less boring and has a better storyline that more people can enjoy. It is the worst Star Wars episode in the Skywalker Saga. Ten years after initially meeting, Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé Amidala, while Obi-wan Kenobi investigates an assassination attempt on the Senator and discovers a secret clone army crafted for the Jedi.

My only problem with this movie is that the romance between Anakin and Padmé can get very boring at times. The best action scene in the film is the Jedi Battle scene. I loved that Sir Christopher Lee was casted to play the main antagonist in the movie Count Dooku. The film has brilliant visual effects and had great action sequences. It is an enjoyable film for the whole family to enjoy. 

Grade B"
"This film is, in my opinion, only marginally better than The Phantom Menace.

Ewan McGregor had a larger role as Obi-Wan, and that made significant sections of the film more tolerable.

Any scene that had anything to do with Hayden Christensen was just abysmal. Absolutely horrendous. I don't know if it was the script, or lack of acting ability, but everything about his performance was painful to watch.

The ""romance"" scenes with Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen)? The words uncomfortable and slightly creepy come to mind. I don't understand how anyone could watch this film and believe that Padme and Anakin were in love. Or even liked each other.

It's so bizarre.

There is a lot of CGI used in Attack of the Clones, and a lot of it is bad. The use of green screen is incredibly noticeable in many scenes.

The plot makes little sense, though it lends itself to more exciting sequences than that of The Phantom Menace.

Excruciating."
Slight improvement over The phantom menace but it still has annoying characters and undermines the franchises legacy.
"Much better than the last previous entry, but still dumb."
Not a bad movie but they have too much of a love story in it. This is Star Wars not a romance. Still this is way better than Episode 1. You will want to see it if you loved the original trilogy.
"A boring plot and bad actor chemistry makes this a Star Wars movie nearly as bad as Rian Johnson's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi""."
"There's not much to say. There are a few nice action set pieces, but our heroes are unlivable and stupid, the romance is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious in places, and once again the plot relies on everybody being incredibly gullible and/or just completely idiotic."
"The awful cringe-worthy acting, script is parody worthy of the first. But instead creates a failed performance ruining the Star Wars series all together."
"While Attack of the Clones is an improvement over its predecessor and still showcases Lucas' imagination, it also showcases that Star Wars can grow stale and have all the appeal of stale leftovers."
Bad this one is. Kamino and the Jango Fett v Kenobi battle is the only memorable scene. Hayden Christenson and Portman have unbearably bad chemistry in one of the most forced love stories in movie history. Christenson is an awful choice for Vader made worse by terrible dialogue and poorly contrived action sequences. The Gladiator pit features atrocious special effects.
a solid film. Christopher lee is a legend
Your kidding right. This is so goddamn  awful.
I like sand as much as this movie!
A surprisingly entertaining and solid Star Wars film.
"A fun, flawed journey to a galaxy far, far away."
"Some may say either The Last Jedi or The Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars movie. For me, it’s Attack of the Clones. Was bored almost the entire time"
Anakin and padme relation very bad
THIS IS A GARBAGE MOVE WITH NO REDEEMING QUALITIES!
"Was passiert wenn man die 3 Mammut Aufgaben für einen Blockbuster alleine lösen muss? Man verliert den Überblick und es endet im Mittelmaß oder noch schlimmer bei der Goldenen Himbeere. Lucas hatt dennoch mit Hilfe des heute nicht mehr so ganz Dreidimensionalem CGI das digitale Kino um Jahre nach vorne getrieben. Dennoch ist die Romanze zwischen der unterforderten Natalie Portman und dem grinsenden Haydn Christensen gescheitert auf Grund mangelnder Vielschichtigkeit. Zu wenig Zeit für richtige Beweggründe der Gefühle. Doch Schauspieler waren ja auch noch genügend da. Evan McGregor zeigt in den Prequilles was für ein Kaliber von Schauspieler er ist, Samuel L jackson spielt solide doch man sieht wenig wie von vielen der Charaktere die interessant sein könnten. Am Ende fällt Episode 2 auch bei vielen wegen der teils grausigen Dialoge, Stichwort Sand. So bleibt Episode 2 im Mittelmaß der Filmgeschichte und auf der Todesliste der Fangeschichte"
"The Worst Star Wars film, nothing really redeemable in this movie expect that one line about the death sticks."
Better than The Last jedi and The Force Awakens.
"The acting is terrible in this movie, and the romance between Anakin and Padme is incredibly forced. The only entertaining part of this movie is the Obi-Wan and Jango Fett fight. Other than young Boba Fett, of course."
"The love story sucks but the action is satisfying and it is the start of my favorite war in Star Wars, as well as introduces my favorite faction, the Separatist Alliance."
"I love Star Wars, I truly do, but this movie is just not good.
Apart from the memorable action sequence in the asteroid field and the arena battle, this movie is filled with cringy dialogue, average performances and badly aged visual effects.
The romance between Anakin and Padme is just not believable enough for me to invest in it. If it wasn't for the Clone Wars and books , I wouldn't understand why Anakin turns evil when she dies in the next one. Spoilers I guess"
Love the action and clones. Really enjoy the new characters introduced like Jango and Count Dooku.
Pretty good installment in the Star Wars franchise.
"Dude....the birth of the clones! Yes....mediocre acting from a couple main stars, and a skosh of cheese....but the darkness and weight of the cloning facility, plus the Death of so many Jedi lends a gravity to this movie that is unparalleled in the live action SW universe. The Fett side plot has ramifications that echo into the original trilogy, as well a the amazing and underrated The Clone Wars Series. Overall.....a horribly underrated addition the the Star Wars live action mythology!"
Love the final act of this movie. The action is great and the clones are awesome.
Great action and good plot overall. I find this movie very enjoyable.
"'I hate sand, it's coarse and rough and it gets everywhere.' Wow, you have to try to be that bad."
"The worst of the prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones is filled with more CG, even faker than before, hammier performances, the worst of which is Hayden Christensen, and surprisingly worse writing. ""I don't like sand"" will forever go down in film history."
The movie is ok. But if you hated Anakin in episode I he is even worse in episode II.
"As a child, I loved almost anything Star Wars. I couldn't understand the hate directed by The Phantom Menace, which was one of my favorite movies. I ate up prodigious quantities of tie-in novels of questionable quality. I even collected Star Wars merchandise and memorabilia, buying such items as a Lucasfilm-approved painting of Admiral Ackbar wearing a 19th century French naval officer's uniform and a fast food promo cup with a lid shaped like Jar Jar Binks. Even then, however, I hated Attack of the Clones.

The main problem with Attack of the Clones is the romance around which the film is centered. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen have no chemistry with each other and neither gives a good performance even when not playing off each other. (I suspect that bad directing is at least partially responsible for this, as I know that Natalie Portman can act.) Furthermore, the writing makes Anakin come off as extremely creepy. Several of his statements over the course of the film should have set off alarm bells in Padme's head, but somehow his whining and creepy advances (not to mention outright murder) cause Padme to fall in love with him.

The film is also a lot slower paced than A New Hope, and I don't think it works in the film's advantage. The slower pace works in The Empire Strikes Back because it allows time for character development. Outside of the awful romance, however, there is little character development in Attack of the Clones. Instead, the extra runtime is spent on galactic politics, exposition, and a Boba Fett origin story which isn't given any sort of proper closure until the spin off Clone Wars cartoon.

To be fair to the people involved in this film, Ewan McGregor does at least give a good performance. Some of the character and ship designs are also cool. A single decent performance and some cool computer models do not make a good film, however, and the only reason I can see to watch this film, besides completionism, is to gain background knowledge for the vastly superior Clone Wars animated series. It speaks to the scale of the missteps made when a computer-animated cartoon does a better job with many of the same plot threads than a $120 million feature film."
"This is easily the worst Star Wars movie.Nothing else is necessary to say.
-3.5/10"
"While it's probably the weakest entry of the franchise so far, the style and action far supersede that of its predecessor in a way that thankfully makes the inept romance side-plot little more than a frustrating distraction."
I really like this movie.
"Not as bad as the first, that's all"
"Pretty good movie overall. some issues with dialogue, but overall its a worthy installment in the Star Wars franchise."
This movie is fun. Love the action and musical score.
Battle of Geonosis that's all I gotta say.
Some great action. Really like Ewan McGregor in this one.
Has some good parts and better than the first one but the romance is awful and its a terrible idea to make your protagonist a psychopath a movie before he turns evil
OMG WHAT A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! I JUST WATCHED THIS AT THE CINEMA IT ONLY JUST CAME IN ZIMBABWE I LOVE THE PART WHEN HE SAYS I DONT LIKE SAND IT IS THE BEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN ALSO ITS SOOOOO COOL HOW JANGO FETT LOOKS WEIRDLY LIKE BOBA FETT ITS ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE RELATED
I don't know why so many people don't like the priequels I think their awesome ??
Hot steaming large SHITE
"I thought ""The Phantom Menace"" was bad. This was worse."
Nice movie. Interesting plot
An enjoyable film overall. Really like the last half hour with the battle of Geonosis. The dialogue is a little cringey at times but overall the film is a worthy installment in the Star Wars franchise.
Very entertaining. The last half hour with the battle of Geonosis was awesome. Dialogue was cringey at times but the story was interesting and we finally got to see the clones.
Worst Star Wars Movie aside from SOLO: A Star Wars
"To me, ""Attack of the Clones"" is so far the worst cinematic Star Wars film. It doubles down on the problems of its predecessor, making for an even more disappointing and less entertaining experience. A decade after the events of ""The Phantom Menace"", Anakin Skywalker is older now and trains with Obi Wan Kenobi.  The Galactic Republic is threatened once again, this time by a former Jedi Master, Count Dooku, who has organized a Separatist movement. That's as far as you have to know about the plot, even though it does feel like a lot more is happening throughout this film - most of which is hard to recall. It's a slow and quite boring film, which is a crime, because the concept of the prequel trilogy is very interesting. It has several dull moments. Despite the much reduced role of Jar Jar Binks, this film somehow managed to include more cringe inducing moments, most of which are the result of some really unnaturally and weirdly written dialogue. I would say that I found most of the cast more dedicated to their performances than they were in the previous film, particularly the loveable Ewan McGregor. However, the casting of Hayden Christensen in the role of the now 19 year old Anakin Skywalker was simply wrong, because he was creepy in a very uncool way and was unbelievably monotonous in his role; not that his role was a well written one, but still. George Lucas did deliver on the action and the visuals though, even if the latter could have been replaced by a few practical effects. The score was as always captivating. It's not a very bad movie, but it's still pretty bad."
"There are just some things we took for granted, Like this movie. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"Some very cool action sequences, but overall is filled with laughably bad dialogue and predictable plot points."
"Most people say episode 2 is the worst of the franchise but I disagree.  As with all the prequels the dialogue is just plain bad.  The forced romance is also completely unbelievable and is the focus of most people's disdain.  The main story however is very good and has some of the most unique and intriguing characters and locations I've seen in a movie.  The most important part is Christopher Lee is in the film, and he makes everything 10% better by default."
I really liked how Lucas is doing this... but then again.....
"Underrated prequel film, has the spirit of Star Wars, improved acting over the first but has not aged to well. Some of the effects have become obvious"
"The Battle of Geonosis is visually stunning for its time, but the love relationship between Padme and Anakin is very cringeworthy. Hayden and Natalie do not work well together."
I really like the plot but anakin's character is pretty cringey during the first half. So much unnatural feeling angst exuding sporadically just seemed weird and distracting.
"Again, so much hate on the prequels but not too much that the prequels give to defend itself. So... yeah. It's a movie at least."
The final act drags and the CGI has not aged well but the story is still engaging.
"Well, it came. I saw. I WAS BLOWN AWAY!! Yeah, I am a fan of the Star Wars series, but even I was disappointed in The Phantom Menace. With many of the industry's well-known critics slamming this movie, my expectations began to lower. Yes, I was still excited, but I was preparing myself for another flop-ola. So what happened? I'll tell you what happened. I saw a film that brought back the magic of the first trilogy. I saw a film that never had a dull moment in its 2:30+ in duration. Do you have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this movie as much as I did? Maybe, because I cannot understand what these other critics missed. So instead of spoiling the movie by giving away all its twists and turns, this review is for those who saw it, liked it and are confused. This review will be a comparison of reviews from other critics to help give the reader a perspective of the ""type"" of person (in the best way possible) who did not like this movie.

Before we get to the critics, let me make one short statement. Movie critics were not prevalent, as they are now, in 1977 when the first A New Hope was released. Since critics can, at times, be very harsh, I doubt A New Hope would have been the hit it was in 1977 had critics broken it down piece by piece. As dead-on as these critics are sometimes, everyone needs to remembers that they are just critics. They are just giving their opinions. Since most of them are fans of film as an art, they critique films as such and their opinions are derived not from how entertaining the film is, but rather how successful the movie makers artistically expressed the film as a whole via the story, the dialogue, the acting, cinematography, etc. Now, you may be saying, ""uhm, Jeff, all you are doing is giving your opinion. Why should I listen to you?"" Well, good point. But if you will notice, I write my opinions (at least for movies) based on how I would recommend them as entertainment value, specifically for families since I tend to see a lot of family movies with my kids. And in the case of Attack of the Clones, I will be writing and comparing other critics' opinions based on the Star Wars' FAN's point of view, as well as a family recommendation. Either way, I'm not going to get carried away with the ""art"" of Attack as a cinematic masterpiece. In fact, I love that the fact that Attack does not satisfy the artsy-fartsy movie critic, yet is still a FAN's movie and broke $100 million in its first weekend. Since the original Star Wars trilogy was so huge AND had an established fanbase before critics were prevalent, it makes Attack bullet-proof to the critics. Let's remember that fans loathed The Phantom Menace, while many critics like Roger Ebert, gave it a near-perfect rating (see his 1999 review here).

Now onto the critics...

Let's start out with the Grand Pooh-bah of movie critique, Roger Ebert:

First of all, after reading his review of The Phantom Menace, then Attack of the Clones, there were a couple of lines that were hypocritical. 

In the The Phantom Menace review, he wrote, ""The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at."". 

However, in the Attack review, he wrote, ""But as someone who admired the freshness and energy of the earlier films, I was amazed, at the end of ""Episode II,"" to realize that I had not heard one line of quotable, memorable dialogue."" While at another point he states, ""

Hypocrite...

Frankly, the dialogue in the Star Wars movies has always been a little weak. And, yes, I can completely understand that there is an element missing from this second trilogy so far that is the cynic, the skeptic, like Han Solo was in the first trilogy. However, these movies are pre-destined. We already now the RESULT of these three movies. We want to know HOW it gets there. The Phantom Menace was boring in many aspects (though not really as bad as everyone thought--our expectations would have NEVER been satisfied), but there had to be a start. There had to be a beginning to it all. I'm pretty sure that Lucas could have done a little better, but not much. Building those characters and setting the tone for the future had to be done and with Attack, you can tell why Lucas did what he did. Yes, he eats some crow in the movie by displaying the biggest fan-favorite character, Boba Fett, and limiting Jar-Jar's lines (yet maximizing his impact to the overall storyline). However, Lucas did a superb job in getting the story moving toward where we know it will end up.

Across town from Ebert, the Chicago Tribune gives their version. Mark Caro, who gave Attack 2 stars as Ebert did, writes: ""For such a visually oriented filmmaker, Lucas commits an unpardonable sin: He tells instead of shows.""

I can actually agree with this. While the dialogue did not impress me much, the dialogue is not why I go to Star Wars movies. It's the story. Granted, like The Phantom Menace, Lucas is packing a lot of story into the allotted time, Attack is more exciting, has more interesting twists and, frankly, is setting us up for a what should be an incredible third movie. However, as Caro wrote, to help pack more progress into this film, Lucas does end up ""telling"" a lot without showing the progress in visuals. The exception is when Anakin goes to Tattoine and begins descending to the darkside once finding his mother. The way that part of the story progressed was very visual and lead-up-to via the many references to his recurring bad dreams.

So is it a bad thing that Lucas has to tell us rather than show us? Well, since it does not impact the overall amount of action in this movie, I would say no. Is it different for Lucas? Absolutely, but not necessarily a bad thing. I think Lucas is trying to get himself out of the rut he put himself into by starting the story with Anakin as a child in The Phantom Menace. In the first trilogy, the story seemed to flow better because there were not as many time-delays. Luke was an upper teen in A New Hope and ended as a twenty-something in Return of the Jedi. Lucas should have avoided trying to bring in new children fans and started Anakin out that way as well. 

Mark Caro's co-hort at the Chicago Tribune, Michael Willmington, is more of a fan focusing on the fan's appeal to this movie. He gives the movie 4 stars and writes: ""Nothing in the first four movies quite matches the continuous visual bravura of this one, which is almost as much a digital age marvel as the '77 ""Star Wars"" was of an earlier era of miniatures and models. For most of its 2-hour span, the movie keeps topping itself, not dramatically, but with one pure, explosively delivered, ripely detailed action set-piece after another.""

I could not agree more. When I was a five year old watching A New Hope, my interest in the movie was not because of the intricate storytelling, the relationship of the force to modern religious beliefs, the contrast of Han's cynicism to Luke's desire to believe it all. No, I like how cool the Landspeeder was. Man, it was a FLOATING CAR! And I liked the Millennium Falcon. Hyperdrive was cool!! Lightsabers? AWESOME! And the X-Wing fighters flying through the corridors of the Death Star to find that one little hole that will make it blow up? Oh yeah, baby. THAT was what the movie was about. Carry that interest to The Empire Strikes Back when there were the cool snowspeeders on Hoth, the dual-cabined Cloud Pods on Bespin, Boba Fett's cool costume, Luke and Darth's first encounter, etc. Then carry that yet again into Return of the Jedi, where there is an all-out, free-for-all fight extraordinaire when the second Death Star was going to be destroyed. Have you ever seen so many Tie Fighters?? And those Biker Scouts were cool!!

See what I mean? Ebert had it right when he reviewed Phantom. Dialogue is secondary (if not even LESS important) to the cool visuals, the overall story and the action! Lucas remembered that this time and that is why Attack is so good. Hayden Christensen is an absolutely horrible actor. I thought that throughout the film. But does it ruin it? Not at all. You see more and more of where the story is going. And to top it off, what you THINK is going to happen doesn't. Despite how many trailers were released, you DON'T know what's going to happen. As much as they showed you, you have not prepared yourself for what you will be seeing. 

So go do it...now...many, many, many more times over the summer. Ignore the critics. Go see Attack of the Clones today and form your own opinion. If you are a Star Wars fan, you will love it."
Worst attempt at a love story... ever.... urggghh. Really didn't like how the romantic scenes took place in the story. felt very disturbing and horribly done. And it doesn't help that the CLones only appear for a short amount of time in the film.
"What's up with the dialogue? Whats up with the acting? What's up with the love story?
What's up? This film is just awful. ruins Star Wars completely. Where the quality? It's just a really bad movie. That's all there is."
My least favourite film of the franchise until i saw the last jedi but i can still enjoy it
"Bad acting, dialogue, plot choices... and they completely ruined the imagery of the ""clone wars"" in a lot of fans imaginations...  Would've been best left up to the imagination."
"A couple of awkward lines, but besides that it was pretty good"
"the best on of the prequels.  again so much potential and fell short. anakin acting like a whiny spoil child was hugely annoying.  the clones were cool, lots amazing battles and yoda fighting count dooku was pretty cool."
"Decent storyline, horrible chemistry and film making. Maybe leave it as a book or something."
"My least favorite of the Star Wars movies. Nothing really consequential happens until the last 20 minutes, and even the thrilling duels and arena battle are enough to over shadow the terrible dialogue (""I hate sand"") and slow moving plot."
Una basura de pelicula
This movie is the fortnite of cancer and i hate fortnite and this movie i give this movie -100%
"The film has excellent action scenes and a very interesting story,but like in the first film,it uses a lot of CGI"
"A few more action scenes than the Phantom Menace, but disappoints even worse than where The Phantom Menace did."
This was awful until the final battle wher the film became epic!
The last 45 minutes outweigh the horrid romance scenes.
the battle geonosis was shown very well. how the clone wars began.
A fun movie that is brought down by some bad dialogue and messy story telling. But there are some nice Star Wars moments within.
"Say what you will about The Phantom Menace, but Attack of the Clones is more worst than the first (my opinion if you disagree with me). The wooden acting is still their, same thing goes for the bad writing; with some corny romance and all the political talk they throw are not well followed and interesting."
"George Lucas, what was that? I'll tell you what I want to hear from him, a 2 and a half hour rushed CGI seizure with a lot of dull acting with clunky comedy. THE worst in the franchise."
"Bad, bad, bad dialogue. But Obi-Wan has a great beard."
Doesn't make me hate Star Wars looking at you TLJ
better than SJW wars
"Oh dear lord. This movie is just really bad. The acting is laughable, the plot is terrible and let's just say 4 words. ""I don't like sand."""
this film sucks but i enjoy it for its cheesy and cringe moments
i hate episode 2 its course and rough and irritating and it getts everywhere
"Lightsaber fights at the end were only half desent. Rest of the movie was long, boring, and dead."
"Attack of the Clones features an awful romance and horrible dialogue, and delivers what is easily one of the worst films in the Star Wars saga."
"The worst of all movies. Way too much CGI, Anakin's still a big let down, to much cheesy and poorly written romance story. But McGregor still shines and the battle scenes in the end are good, but no match for todays standarts. 3*"
I actually liked this film because it had a fett in it... other than that it sucked.
"Star Wars the Clone Wars have happened the Clones are the Soldiers to face the battle droids the Sith are trying to take control of everything it’s up to the Jedi to bring Peace, keep in mind how Anakin acts with his personality, is he becoming bad or good! That’s where you find out Anakin is a Jedi and pretty competitive with fighting along with his master Obie Wan. Both must take the Sith down."
Ah the cloners rock!
"By skipping over literally every minute of the cringeworthy Anakin/Padme romance subplot, the movie becomes tolerable, and quite enjoyable in some aspects. Particularly the third act."
anakin is now a whiny bitch.  the jedi are cool with leading a SLAVE army of clones.  morally gross.
"For the love of God, please stop ruining Star Wars."
So much better than Disney Star Wars
"An amazing movie has aged well, gave a great insight into the star wars universe"
"A good continuation of the story of Anakin. This movie is rather dialogue heavy at times, so it might not be as suitable to the younger audience. 

Anakin's abilities in the force grow, but his arrogance creates problems for himself and his mentor. Political tensions rise as we see the beginnings of the Empire and Anakin's turn."
"Attack of the Clones is an exceptional step up from The Phantom Menace that weaves an exciting tale of our now grown characters. Lucas makes the right decision of pushing away Jar Jar Binks to focus on the well developed characters and develop more creative humor rather than the childish gags Binks brought in Phantom Menace. Introduced to bounty hunters, execution arenas and upgraded militant droids - the heroes face off in an excitingly gripping movie; with the inclusion of the slight flawed romantic gestures of Anakin, this movie still encaptures emotion from his journey to find his mother and packs a punch with the new villains Jango Fett and Count Dooku taking the charge."
Again looks like a star wars movie feels like a star wars movie! Not the best instalment in the prequels but still good fun to watch with plenty of action and lightsaber duels.
"The script for the movie was atrocious.  The characters were good, but there's only so much even a talented actor can do with a bad script.  The action was still good but maybe a little too much CGI.  Not the worst in the franchise...but it's close.  The only Star Wars movie worse than this is ""The Last Jedi"".  This movie at least left me wanting to see more of the Star Wars universe and had me excited for the next movie.  Overall this still felt like a genuine Star Wars movie."
Better than Disney's Star Wars
Like a Star Wars version of Camelot this film has it all. Groundbreaking CGI and originality which bests anything to come out of Disney era to date.
"This movie was poor showing for the Franchise. The special effects and computer graphics make it a great show to watch but the poor script, dialogue and horrible acting from the main characters, hurt the movie. There is no chemistry between Hayden and Natalie, 2 actors which have done great work in other movies. It's still worth watching as long as you don't have high expectations.  Lastly, the battles are well shot and entertaining."
"I don't feel this was nearly as bad as the first one, but still pretty bad. if you can fast forward past the whiny anakin/padme bad acting scenes it's not so terrible. Obi Wan and Palpatine are probably the best to see in this movie."
Great non Disney film
Much better than Menace but not Hayden as good as in part III
"I didn't hate this movie as much as everyone else. It was bad, but at least it wasn't The Last Jedi."
"I don;'t like sand.
This movie is fine but the name of the whole movie almost means nothing until the end of the movie."
"My favorite, I love how the story shows actual Escalation and the Plot Grows and the Stakes rise each and every film, as two people from secluded cultures hold onto one another as everything they know and love, crashes down around them..."
A real Star Wars film with great action and character development. Thank you George Lucas.
As a Star Wars Fan This was my favorite from the prequel era!
This is a family favorite that we watch a least once a year along with the rest of the PT and the OT!
"Attack Of The Clones = Be bored for 2 hours straight.
The Last Jedi = Be bored for 2 hours straight and lose all your brain cells.
Yeah I think I'll take AOTC, thank you very much."
"Cringeworthy at times,bad too.But amidst all that bad stuff hides a fun action movie."
"It was a MEHHH, maybe I will vote high because star wars will always have a special place for me. Love seeing boba."
Better than the Last Jedi..... But it's hard to make a movie that bad
"I have to say that I love  this movie. This is the Jedi at its best, fighting and suffering together, and none of them is thinking about retirement. The visuals are stunning, Obi Wan is just excellent, and Natalie Portman is gorgeous. Even the politics make sense,  the fall of a Republic and the beginning of an Empire. It has the greatest Yoda line, ""the shroud of the dark side has fallen.""  The music is also epic, pure John Willians emotion. I have no problem with the plots, specially the Obi Wan / Anakin relationship, wich I think is great. Attack of the Clones is a great movie."
my favorite of all the films. severely under-rated.
"""Attack of the Clones"" is a minute improvement over ""The Phantom Menace"". Might want to skip through the cringe worthy romance."
"You can not please everyone but these movies have to be understood first. You have to see what George was doing when he came up with the prequels. Once you do that, you will see how good these movies are. I did see how and what George was doing in developing the store and how he tied it in with the original trilogy. Give the movie the chance it really deserves."
The worst of the Prequels.  But a few fun battle scenes.
"this installment gave me hope of George Lucas redeeming himself after the Phantom Menace tragedy, but when I first saw it, I was even more disappointed. This movie hod nothing, it was empty, filled with horrible acting, and cringe lines. The acting is once again horrible, and there is nothing to like about the movie. The good parts of the movie only lasted for about five minutes, the rest was predictable George Lucas style star wars. At least the Phantom Menace had Darth Maul, and the pod race, this had nothing. Star wars the Attack of the clones is the worst star wars movie by far, a true tragedy"
I liked this film a lot.
this had a lot of potential and some underrated action scenes but it focused too much on Aniken and Padme's love story.
Talk about bad acting and no chemistry. It's almost as if Portman and Christiansen were trying to act bad. George we love you but please come up with the ideal and let someone else write and direct please.
Better than Phantom but storyline still weak...
"A pretty good film exists within this movie, it just needs 15 minutes cut out of it.  Did a lot of world building."
"Before The Last Jedi came out, this was the worst Star Wars movie of all time. However, that’s not all an insult. Episode 2 is a good movie on its own. However, clunky CGI, as well as poorer dialogue quality than in The Phantom Menace (as well as ROTS too) hinders the movie. Hayden Christensen’s performance is mediocre at best in this film, possibly even shaky. Hayden does however bounce back in Revenge of the Sith, becoming the one and only Anakin. The shining lights that are Jango Fett, Mace Windu, and Count Dooku are clouded by the CGI. The Clone Wars deserve a new movie, as this should’ve been the best and most exciting of the prequels. Rating: 3.5/5... 74%"
Least favorite Star Wars film
"Introduction and first battle of clones was amazing, Jedi vs sith fight scenes were excellent as well. Battle of Genosis was awesome. Other than these few moments, the rest of the movie was kind of boring, reason I took off stars. Regardless, can watch this movie over and over."
"Easily the worst of the Prequels. The film has a horribly artificial look to it and it's stale plotting makes this so boring. Worst of all, the constant over use of Shakespearean dialogue over and over makes me never want to see it again."
bleh this is a trash romcom in space but its not funny or romantic
"This movie is soooo bad it would be laughable if I wasn't so angry that something so pandering and poorly written was being passed off as Star Wars official canon. The writers (Lucas among them I presume) don't care a thing for any of these characters and the actors, most whom are veterans of the stage and screen, have no idea how to care about the characters they embody. The acting is on par with a soap opera at best. And if someone doesn't kill Jar-Jar soon here I'm going to scream as I rip my ears off and gouge out my eyes. All-in-allanenjoyablefilmIhighlyrecommend"
"Aside from the Jango/Boba Fett backstory and the Arena Scene, I didn't enjoy much in this movie. For me, this is the lowest point in the SW franchise."
"Pretty much has all the same weak points as The Phantom Menace with not many improvements. For once we actually get to see the Jedi do something, however then there's also the dreadful romance story."
"While improving on its predecessor in some areas, it falls short in some other areas and ends up feeling like a much less genuine product. The shift from film to digital cameras gives this episode a very distinct clean cheap look, and the cgi suffers the most from this too. Performances are bad, the dialogue is laughable at times. The mystery in place is interesting, but the swap between that plot and terrible romance scenes break the pace. The highlight of the film is the action scene near the end in the Petranaki Arena on Geonosis, with a large group of Jedi engaging in battle, but there's very little substance here and ends up feeling quite boring and hollow."
Urm...Yoda with a light saber. No JarrJarr.
6th best star wars film
"Bad CGI, plot, acting"
Boring and not redeeming for the prequels
Still one of the most underrated Star Wars movies. Regardless of what other may say of it I still love this movie for making me love Star Wars again.
"This is not a good movie. Some of the pieces were there, but Lucas seemed to make all the wrong decisions with how to utilize them. Puppet Yoda will be missed (until Last Jedi)"
Probably the worst Star Wars film in the saga.
"Probably the weakest Star Wars movie of the orginal 6, but i still enjoyed it alot. Which is a testament to the greatness of the Star Wars brand, which even at it's lowest, is still pretty good. If only there was more Clone Wars in the Attack of the Clones, and less Twilight..."
"Worst of the Star Wars movies, but it's still Star Wars."
"not great, the scenery is hard to swallow as everything is overly CGI. the writing and script is clunky"
"The Attack of the Clones has some worthwhile action sequences and gorgeous visuals, but some annoying characters, bad writing  and cheesy, unmemorable plot points makes this movie still  forgettable and bland."
Young man attempts to find love while having a bad day at the beach
"Wow, this film was extremely disappointing. The acting is still rubbish, except for Ewan McGregor of course. The story is confusing and unbalanced. The only good thing about this film is the visuals. They are 10x better than the ones in the Phantom Menace. This film is watchable for only hardcore Star Wars fans."
"The political drama continues, the characters had an old theatre feeling that felt peculiar and interesting, the character of Anakin makes me nervous, the backgrounds are very elaborated and innovated, the romance between Anakin and Padme is very sweet, I don't like too much the acting of boba fett in this one, the character of count dooku play by Christopher lee creates a very strong atmosphere, the fabric sequence seems to be there for filling, the war sequences felt real, Yoda looks very powerful"
"A great story with terrible casting and lame dialogue.  Actually Natalie Portman's Padmé Amidala is decent, but  Hayden Christensen's Anakin is wooden & the chemistry between them is fizzles not sizzles."
At least it wasn't as bad as the Last Jedi.
When you don't listen to your elders you lose a hand! Quick to Anger....better cool down there young Skywalker! Yoga has is Force Eyes on you 😑
"Better than phantom menace, with some good ideas. But some of dialog was just plain bad, I don't know if it was the choose of actors or the script. But ther performances should have been better. I feel this and Phantom menace should have been merged into a single film"
Worst of the prequels?? In my book.... Yes
i don't like sand it's corse rough and  irritating and it's get everywhere
Pretty terrible. The worst of any Star Wars movie by a wide margin.
"Attack of the Clones is probably the 2nd best Star Wars prequels after revenge of the sith, although is it my favorite movie enjoyment wise. It features my favorite character Jango fett, and coincidentally one of the things I don’t like is that jango got killed off so easily. Also the bounty hunter chase in the beginning was kinda grody. But other than the only thing I really didn’t like is that anakin got his hand chopped off by dooku, as I feel this is a rip off of Luke getting his hand chopped off in episode V."
The Last Jedi is better
"This movie is only a step above Phantom Menace if anything. It has all of the same problems, but at least there is more combat in this movie."
"The Last Jedi was so bad that it made this film and The Phantom Menace look like fantastic Star Wars films. In reality, Attack of the Clones was ok, but not great overall. The forced romance between Anakin and Padmé was a bit cheesy, the CGI didn't age that well, and there are a few lines of dialogue that are quite cringe-worthy. The plot is not the strongest in this film, and George Lucas didn't do enough to show Obi-Wan's and Anakin's friendship in this trilogy. Kenobi said in A New Hope, ""He was a good friend,"" but we didn't really get the chance to see it often in the prequels. Additionally, why would the bounty hunter use poisonous bugs to kill Senator Padmé instead of thermal detonators or bombs? I don't believe it was ever explained why the bounty hunters wanted her dead in the film. They get paid to kill and/or capture, but what were the motives? Had they killed Padmé, Anakin might have never turned to the dark side and it would have ruined Palpatine's plan. For the positives, the fight on Kamino between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was cool, Obi-Wan and Anakin chasing the bounty hunter at the beginning was entertaining, Jango Fett and his Slave I fighter chasing Obi-Wan's fighter in space was good, the arena battle between the Jedi and battle droids was good, the Battle of Geonosis between the clone troopers and battle droids was awesome, and the final fight between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Yoda, and Count Dooku was entertaining."
"Attack Of The Clones manages to add something new to Star Wars lore, while boring the shit out of you with a horrible love story and cringe worthy acting...It doesn't even have a Pod Race Scene
 I'll give it 
         - 36%"
"For the longest time, Attack of the Clones was considered my personal low point in the series, but after re-watching it during a palette cleansing session following the latest entry, I found that it held up a lot better than I thought.

The biggest problem with this entry were some of the casting choices, poor acting, and excessive reliance on CGI for the more nonsensical action sequences like the robot foundry. A lot of people complain that there were too many CGI sequences in general, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of the sequences people think are CGI were actually done with real sets and real props. The blending at that point had just gotten to the point that the two were indistinguishable.

Attack of the Clones fixed some of the problems from the previous entry, but added some new ones of its own. Regardless, I appreciate that George Lucas had an overarching story line for the trilogy and stuck to it. The story is consistent, and coherent, and even challenges your understanding of character motivations, such as with Dooku.

The visuals are still on par with what modern audiences expect. Locations are once again fantastic, and we are introduced to more new settings. It progresses the trilogy, but doesn't really blow your mind with any revelations.

Well worth watching, particularly if you have a soft spot for angsty CW quality romance."
"While proving slower than 'The Phantom Menace', this film has one of the greatest stories in the 'Star Wars' saga. Sure, most of the film's dialogue is weak but again, the action and CG make up for it. I'll give it 74%."
Lots of people don't like this film but I do.
"After all these years of imagining what it must have been like, it was so great to finally see adventures of a young Obi Wan and Anakin. And, now we finally get what the Clone War was. Sure, there is some stilted dialogue (don't blame Hayden for that!), but the story and action more than makes up for it."
"This film excels in many ways but fails in one, very specific way: The Anakin/Padmé romance. They are forced together due to the necessity of the plot, chemistry be damned. However, mostly everything else about this movie works, setting up The Clone Wars, a conflict rich in material for the franchise. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a very clear standout here, driving most of the film's plot."
While not the best of the Star Wars films it is still a fun watch. Good action and it progresses the story even if not as deftly as one would like. Obi-Wan really stood out in this movie with his investigating the mysterious Kaminoans and the clones.
I admit that I actually like the prequels. While not perfect I still find all of them enjoyable. After seeing The Last Jedi I have an even greater appreciation for them. Some of the dialogue in this film is weak and the acting needs work but it shows Anakin being pulled by the dark side losing some of his morality making his transition to Darth Vader in the next film understandable. We see him torn and his mentor failing him with some dramatic moments. The love story is the weakest aspect of this film but it shows some of the character motivations. The action sequences are spectacular with the arena battle and final duel being especially good. i still enjoy this film to this day.
It was a good movie but the worst Star Wars movie it was boring but had some cool things in it
"If you mute the tv anytime Anakin talks to Padme, the movie becomes much better."
"Title: Attack of the Clone
Story/Writing/Message/Plot:	2
Character/Acting:		1
Music/Sound:			3
Cinematography/Editing:	3
Age/Originality:			3
Total:			12/25"
Yet again...not one of the best...however a fun and creative time.
"After seeing the horrible Force Awakens movie as well as the spectacular failure that is The Last Jedi, I went back and started all over again. The Phantom Menace is slow, but has a great story. This movie is packed with so much wonderful world building and has a great arc for Anakin Skywalker. I have to say that as I get older, my appreciation for all of the movies grows. The deepness of George Lucas' writing is under appreciated by some, but there is a reason that he became a legend in the film industry. There is literally nothing else like Star Wars in cinematic history. The scale, the gorgeous visuals, the mythology-inspired story, and the love put into the entire universe makes me wish I could go back to 2012 and slap the pen out of Lucas' hand and talk him out of selling Lucasfilm to Disney or at least not handing it over to the vapid Kathleen Kennedy. Now we have to deal with the atrocious fan-fiction that JJ and Rian have wrought upon the world. I am so happy that the Revenge of the Fans is in full force and that people are expressing their total displeasure with the lack of care that the universe has been given."
"Sure there are a few cheesy lines, but there is good character development in this film and the story develops. The prequels have been poorly appreciated, but perhaps appreciation is increasing now that things have changed so much with Star Wars. Much more depth here than The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi."
It's Star Wars So I'm Giving It Five Stars!!
"Their is one good scene in this movie and that is the scene where Anakin kills the Tusken Raiders, but still that scene doesn't go for long enough just so they can maintain a PG-13 rating. This movie is awful. It has some awful CGI effects, the Jedi continue to just sit on chairs while the main characters do all he hard work and of course the cringe-worthy dialogue, and don't get me started on the sand scene"
"I don't mind the politics but the writing for Anakin and Amidala could have been better. Still, overall a satisfying film."
"The worst movie star wars, really bad acting, bad dialogue, bad CGI."
"Underrated movie, it has its moments of suspense, the Jedi do a lot in this film & Anakin's growth is handled really well by Hayden Christensen."
"Star Wars attack of the clones is much better than the first Star Wars. Now Aniken Skywalker is a Padwan you may see that Skywalker is becoming more mad and not listening to orders, Etc. so he is like starting to turn to the dark side!! This one had more fighting more action so it was just what I expected pick what side you are on Sith or Jedi!"
In the minority of people who like this movie.  I particularly liked it due to how we get to see how politics played a role in everything.  Christopher Lee was a tremendous actor... played the role of Dooku so well.
"Star Wars gets better with each film. Episode 2 is better than episode 1. 
But episode 8 is terrible. Attack of the Clones is far better."
"In retrospect, this film is so SUPERIOR to Last Jedi/Rogue One and all the appalling Disney trash in every way. 
Come back George, all is forgiven!"
An absolute masterpiece compared to the Last Jedi. Actually has lightsaber battles in which the protagonist actually suffers loss! His mom dies after being tortured and he gets his hand cut off!
"Similar to The Phantom Menace in several ways, this movie has a muddled plot and a poor script. Anakin and Padme's relationship is as robotic and dull as Hayden Christensen's acting and all the overused CGI. Ewan McGregor is the one bright spot in this movie, but that's not enough to save this deformed mess of a prequel-sequel."
"The core of the prequel trilogy that fully establishes the Age of the Republic into the Star Wars galaxy.  It also shows us the peak skills of the Jedi just before their collapse.  The barrage of color, action, and intrigue, along with the aquatic and sanitized Kamino and the emergence of the clone soldiers, provide a crisp saturation.   Assassin worms, bounty hunters, droids, more Dark Lords of the Sith, and the streets of Coruscant.  While the love story raises eyebrows.  Ewan McGregor successfully takes the lead in this one.  In the only emotional part of the love story, the scene with Anakin's ominous golden arm as he takes Padame's hand at their wedding never fails to chill."
"Not the worst of the Star Wars universe.  First third has more to please your 12-year old self than Last Jedi's first third.   

Would you rather pretend to be Anakin and Obiwan in relentless pursuit through a sci-fi Corurscant on the tail of an assassin/bounty hunter?  Or would you rather be Poe pranking Hux and a bomber pilot kicking down her remote control on a kamikaze run or Leia floating back through space?   Certainly more for the kids to enjoy in Clones, so it inches back out of ""worst Star Wars"" movie mostly because it delivers the goods to please the kids watching than the newer installment does.

Most of the criticism is thrown at Hayden's performance, but through the lens of ""this is an awkward teenage boy"".. he's not just any awkward teenage boy, he's THAT BOY who grows into a mass murderer, so you gotta realize that he was tasked to play a socially awkward character, and in that regard he kind of delivers..."
"This is my 2nd least favorite Star Wars movie. Attack of the Clones may be an improvement of the previous one but its still lacking compared to the original three. The movie improves with better action, better story and the chemistry between Anakin and Padme. The visual effects and animatronics continue to be gorgeous especially R2-D2. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Daniels continue to give a great performances. Also the voice over performance from Frank Oz was great. I liked the costumes and makeup as well. The musical score was fantastic just like in all of the others."
"Attack of the Clones is a grand, sweeping, large-scale adventure. The story is mostly great, with only a few stretches that drag, and as with all the Star Wars movies (especially the prequels), the special effects and action are top notch. That is, after all, why you watch the Star Wars movies; to visit unknown worlds and have a ton of fun doing so. Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones isn't a world-class lesson in dialogue, but between the visual spectacle, first-rate action, and heavenly John Williams score, it is entertainment of the highest degree."
"Hands down my least favourite Star Wars film, even my 12 year old self didn't enjoy this one.

Overall story: 
Clunky dialogue, not exactly fast paced, good premise, but didn't deliver. 

Edits:
1.less talking and political drama, just give us that in the opening crawl.
2. Get some better dialogue for them love scenes
3. I think Yoda should never have been seen during the prequels, heard, spoken to and about (over comlink or fuzzy hologram) but never seen. gives a way better reveal for episode 5 hearing all these great stories about Yoda only to lead up to a little green puppet. Mace can take his place and come rescue Obi and Anakin from Dooku
6. Dooku not a Sith but a Dark Jedi, a puppet, + Maul still alive
7. Boba Fett, Jangos actual son and not a clone.
8. Full blown attack on Coruscant should get this movie going with the republic struggling to defend itself, and clones introduced earlier, more clone vs droid battles!  

Question:
I know theres a lot of hate for Hayden Christensens manikin performance, but who would you have replaced him with at the time this movie came out??"
"Was my least favourite episode from SW franchise, before TLJ came out. Now I can call this masterpiece, despite having multiple flaws, annoying characters, and bit boring story."
"Attack of the Clones not only is worse than all three of the original trilogy of Star Wars movies, it somehow manages to be worse than it's direct predecessor the Phantom Menace. It fails at weaving the different plotlines together in a meaningful way, it's worldbuilding was so flawed it required an entire TV show to fill in the gaps, and it didn't do enough to push Anakin towards his dark destiny. It also has the worst performances in a Star Wars movie by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Temura Morrisson all do good jobs though. It also was the worst Visual Effects of any Star Wars film, with clearly visible green screen where it wasn't necessary."
"It gets better on each additional viewing, but it is still dragged down by unnecessary gaffes and stiff dialogue."
"Absolutely delightful film. Almost as good as Revenge of the Sith.

Lucas was a genius, and his films were better than the fans deserved. The fans deserve this Disney garbage."
"After seeing the appalling movie, The Last Jedi, I revisited Lucas' prequels, and they are far better than Rian Johnson's disgraceful movie. Let's get the bad out of the way, first; The bad with Attack of the Clones is that some of the dialogue is ridiculously bad. Secondly-both, Hayden C. and Natalie P.'s performances are very wooden-probably not helped by Lucas' direction. The other issue is that there's, like with The Phantom Menace, still too much abuse of CGI, and everything looks ridiculously computer generated. CGI shouldn't have been used as complete substance, and there should have been more traditional techniques to give it that organic Star Wars feel. Aside from the glaring flaws, the general story is still very good, with good story arcs. It's the second prequel where you can sense that Lucas genuinely cares about the Star Wars universe and how the story lead to Ep. IV, A New Hope. If only the prequels looked like The Force Awakens/Rogue One, or even like a LOTRs, where Peter Jackson got the balance between old movie techniques and CGI, spot on."
"The previous installment in the series had a plethora of issues (not enough action, overly complex plot, overall existance of Jar Jar), and for the most part AOTC imrpoves in those areas.  However, this film also created its own problems.  The ""romance"" between Anakin and Padme was absolute dogshit, Hayden Christiensen's acting is seriously lackluster, and the dialogue is arguably at its worst in the prequels.  The CGI, especially CGI characters, continues to be pretty bad. However, the plot is a lot more fast-paced and interesting than the last movie.  Kamino was fantastic: the clone army and Obi-Wan's fight with Jango Fett was the high point of the whole film in my opinion. Geonosis was great too, aside from the hamfisted factory sequence. I absolutely loved the clone army throughout the whole film, especially in the Geonosis arena scene.  Count Dooku is an amazing villain and Christopher Lee's performance as him is outstanding.  Overall I think it is on par with TPM but not for the same reasons.  It's still an enjoyable film once you get over its shortcomings."
"For me, this movie was a step up from ""The Phantom Menace."" It presented a much more interesting and mysterious story, quite possibly one of the most mysterious Star Wars stories yet. I absolutely love everything to do with Obi Wan in this movie. Kamino and Geonosis are absolutely brilliant planets and the mystery deepens throughout both of those locations. Jango Fett is a fun character, and I genuinely like him more than his son. The fight scene between Obi Wan and Jango is extremely entertaining, although rather goofy because Obi Wan keeps getting blown up. The entire Geonosis sequence is a lot of fun and Sir Christopher Lee shines in this movie. However, I've only covered half of the movie. The storyline with Anakin and Padme can at times be absolutely horrendous and overall significantly weakens the film. George Lucas is trying so hard to show the audience that Anakin and Padme are falling in love, yet we are presented with such an unrealistic love story that basically plays out as an awkward Anakin acting very creepy and impulsive with a reluctant and somewhat disgusted Padme finally giving in to his love when they are about to be killed in the Geonosian arena. The dialogue in the romance scenes is absolutely awful and a pain in the ass to watch, and Hayden Christensen's acting is unfortunately very stale. This movie does contain my least favorite lightsaber battle in the entire Star Wars series as well. It is hard to tell what is even going on and it's just not entertaining. Part of it is just close ups on their faces while they are swinging their lightsabers in the air like animals. It's pretty dumb. Overall, I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars because of an extremely entertaining and interesting storyline with Obi Wan, fun action, and, once again, brilliant music from John Williams but a pretty bad storyline with Anakin and Padme that drags the movie down significantly."
"It was seeing Last Jedi that truly raised this film in my estimation!
Now it seem like a work of sheer genius in comparison!"
This was a horrible movie but still not as bad as Episode 8
"My Sixth favorite Star Wars movie, good story that remains faithful to spirit of Star Wars, not like the new Disney abominations."
"The last half of the movie is wicked, Wayy better than that SJW garbage Disney is making."
Great movie. The love story and Dialogue were awkward and forced but Obi Wan was incredible in this movie and the Gillian Count Dooku was amazing. Only real issue was everything was done on a green screen.
"This movie has somuch depth! Look at a character Iike Bail Organa who barely has any appearances or lines and yet every time on screen he's able to do so much. Look a at his facial express and mannerisms at the end of the movie with Palpatine looking at what he's created, toward the future will pride, while Bail is extremely upset and concerned. It's moments like this that enhance the original trilogy-knowing that Bail has been a part of this gift all along-his reverence for the Jedi leading his daughter, years later, to seek out Obi Wan for help. And the tragedy of Anakin's downfall whose only crime was loving."
"Felt like an actual Star wars film, not some neo feminist garbage."
"A couple good ideas, a bunch of really bad ones, and hands-down the single worst romance I've ever seen on film. Avoid it like it's the f*cking plague."
"For me weakest of the prequels but still a solid Star Wars movie , only one so far of the main movies to feature that many Jedi fighting alongside each other, and set up ep3 really well ."
"Better than the new Disney crap except Rogue One, that was good."
"Cool movie, many flaws, but a good attempt to do something truly different."
I love the fact that there are no Mary Sues in this movie. 5/5 stars!
"The prequels are a terrific return to the Star Wars universe. People do not appreciate the task of creating the entire universe in which the original Star Wars story takes place. In AOTC exploring Coruscant, traveling to the multiple, diverse worlds, seeing the origins of the Death Star and Boba Fett, and the Start of the Clone Wars were a complete treat. Sure, some of the dialogue was challenging, but this is not some haughty weepy drama film, it's Sci-Fi."
Definatley had that clunky dialogue but was a good Star Wars film.  Waited a long time to see young Anakin Wield his lightsaber.  Would defiantly had like to have seen Anakin played a bit more straight laced here but All in all good film.
Meh. Definitely not the best Star Wars movie but but there were a few good moments in this film. Most of it was pretty boaring and there was some pretty awful dialogue. An average movie at best.
better than the new disney stuff
"I was angry about the original trilogy ""special edition"" when the prequel trilogy was released, and I didn't gave these a fair chance at the time. In contrast now to Kennedyfilm's fake sequels, George Lucas's prequels shine. Love Obi-Wan especially in this episode."
Attack of the Clones is two different movies smashed together. The first is a passable space adventure and decent Star Wars movie starring Obi-Wan Kenobi and an investigation into the murder of an alien and a mysterious bounty hunter... the other is a negative star movie starring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen and their stilted and forced love story with some of the most cringe worthy scenes and dialogue ever produced by Hollywood. Ultimately the latter is so bad it dooms the former and the whole movie to a flop. The overuse of CGI also gets dishonorable mention as it looked forced at the time and has aged very poorly.
most pointless of the prequels story wise you wont miss anything by skipping this. Tone of the film is more serious and action oriented.
"Not the best star wars film, but the last hour was decent"
"Like with Episode 1, when I first watched this movie when it came out, I think a lot of it went over my head, all the politics aspect of it. However, now that I'm older, especially this past year, I've gone and watched all the prequel movies and find them entertaining. I get them now, and they (episode 1-6) all fit into a whole, complete awesome. Looking over the whole span of the 1-6 saga, I look back to this movie and it's beautiful to see Anakin and Padme's romance. He's a hot-head, completely smitten with her, and completely awkward in how to talk to her, but he's young and has hearts in his eyes, lol. The novel portrays Padme more of a willing paramour than the movie does, so in the movie her dialogue makes Anakin seem a lot more ""stalker"" like. But i love their cute puppy love interactions on Naboo. Looking over the whole saga (1-6), I really love this movie."
"Better than Phantom, but the romance scenes are painfully written. And then there's Hayden Christensen. Action and lightsaber battles may still be worth the price of admission."
"A touch dull, forced scenes and clunky dialogue and some plain old bad acting, make this one more filler than killer."
"I know it isn't a popular opinion, but I really like this film. It is the intro to the Clone Wars movie & series."
"While this movie has its fair share of clunky dialogue and acting it is underrated as a Star Wars Movie. Take another look. This had some of the best visuals and most impressive battle scenes ever filming in the Star Wars universe. The design was brilliant and there are some great / classic Star Wars moments - Yoda with a lightsaber, Anakin falling through Coruscant, Jedi / Droid battle, Mace killing Jango, The Acklay and many more."
"I had always thought this was the lowest point of the Star Wars franchise, I was wrong.  I saw The Last Jedi and this movie is a complete GEM compared to that pile of trash."
"Worst Star Wars film by far. Cringe-worthy dialogue, unconvincing performances, and a plot that bores to tears. Nearly unwatchable."
So much better than the Last Jedi. Seeing the Last Jedi has given me new found appreciation and love for this movie. I hope Rian Johnson rots in hell for what he did to Star Wars.
"Gets points for being Star Wars but is by far the worst of them. Badly written, poor acting. Have no idea what they were meaning to do with this film. But it can't have been anything good. Keeps me just about interested enough to not fall asleep. But it can't make up for the romance we have all learnt feel nothing for."
"One of the worse Star Wars films due to it's subpar actor and underdeveloped characters, Attack of the Clones' only saving points are it's great action scenes such as the lightsaber fights (personally I like Yoda in a lightsaber duel), the arena on Geonosis, and the badass bounty hunter that is Jango Fett. But otherwise, an addition to the Star Wars saga that will remain ingrained in our minds for all eternity, for better or for worse."
Plan 9 From Outer Space is easier to watch.
"Good movie, plot development ties EpI to EpIII well. At least it makes sense for the most part. Great introducing new worlds, technology, and situations. Its sad to watch Anakin go downhill in his emotional and impulsive nature. But it explains how he slides into the dark side. I don't know why Ep2 has a 57% by viewers, but ok. I liked it well enough to give it a passing grade for a Star Wars canon. Dialogue between Padme and Anakin was abit forced and clunky. Padme has got to have a brick off the load for her to fall in love with him, given what all he said to her. But then again, Natalie Portman's characters fall in love with homicidal maniacs in other movies too like Vendetta for example."
Way better then the last Jedi
Pretty bad but not as bad as phantom menace
"Great cinematography and special effects, of course.

But I wish George Lucas would let someone else direct. Acting is too stilted, especially from Portman and Christensen. Thank goodness for Ewan McGregor.

And someday Star Wars will develop really robust female characters, I'm sure. But not this day."
"Up until the last jedi released this was the worst Star Wars had to offer. Its still terrible in nearly every way. Overused CGI, terrible acting, cringy romance. Why is it better than Ep 8? Because still you came out of the movie wanting to know what will happen next, you still had characters you cared for and you still had the feeling of being in a star wars movie for most of the time. Something that can not be said about the newest installation. Still, if you would take Ep I and II cut most of the cringy stuff out and put it together, salvaging the few good bits, you would get ONE okayish Star Wars movie. 5>4>6>>7>R1>3>1>2>>>8"
My apologies to George Lucas.  His prequels tower above Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi
"People say that star Wars is made for children; Children cannot understand or care about the political intrigues/agendas, about the traders embargo etc. etc. 
All in all it is okay but not a wow film."
"A mi sí me gustó, es una buena pelicula y quienes la critican es por ser fanboys de la trilogia original, la cual no aporta tantop de historia."
Can't get how this can have a better rating than episode I. This is even worse in my opinion. CGI sucks extremly in this one.
This film is great and a true original continuation of the Star Wars saga. The CGI is not the best but the actors except for the guy playing Anakin are really god.
Slightly better than PM but not by much
There are scenes that I don't care for but all in all a good Star Wars movie
"""Wait! This was a star wars movie?""
This was the worst. Not even a good story or characters besides obi wan and yoda and mace and Dooku. Worst star wars."
"The romance stuff is weird and cringey, though not completely unexpected given Anakin's psychological makeup.  The chase on Coruscant and the detective subplot with Obi-Wan are the movie's highlights in my opinion.  The scenes with Anakin's anger regarding the Tusken Raiders (both the scenes at the camp, and when he rages to Padme) are frightening in how real everything feels.  You get a little glimpse into Anakin's mind, and Hayden Christensen does a phenomenal job there channeling his inner darkness.  Dialogue like ""slaughtered them like animals. I hate them"" is brutal in its viciousness, and very thematically necessary to properly understanding the Anakin character.  The final third act on Geonosis starts out pretty cool, but then it goes a little too far over the top with CGI overkill (though, this IS the Clone Wars...).  The lightsaber combat is underwhelming, with half-baked fights.  It would have been nice to see a longer fight between Obi-Wan and Dooku (specifically, I wanted to see more of how Anakin would fight against the Count), and I honestly would have preferred seeing far more of that fight than the Yoda one (which felt too contrived).  Not as good as The Phantom Menace or Revenge of the Sith (Episode III is my favorite of the prequels, and probably my second favorite Star Wars movie behind The Empire Strikes Back), but still entertaining enough (also, it's a highly original affair, in contrast to the ridiculous sequel trilogy)."
"Amazing movie, doesn't deserve all the crap"
"The story isn't bad. I think I like it a little more because it is Star Wars. I don't really like police stories which is really what this is with an awful love story tacked on. George can't write love stories. It's okay, neither can Timothy Zahn. I wish they would get someone who can, to help them out, though!
I really dislike the characterization of Anakin. Growing up a slave I think would have made him far more practical, more likely to rely on himself instead of others, and once he was freed he would have been driven to succeed and prove that he belonged with the Jedi. The whining, spoiled brat that we get instead is a real let down! He's about 23 but acts like a teenager at best. It really seems to me to be one of the first steps in the attempted take down of Vader. GL has made it clear that he never intended for Vader to become as popular as he became and it seem to me that he resents it a little. He's wanted Luke, Obi Wan, Yoda, and the Droids to be the really popular ones; and they are, but Vader is probably the most recognizable of all. He has made comment about how really pitiful Vader because he's really just a sad, damaged cripple on life support. Sorry George, maybe that's want you wrote, but that's not the way it came off. Maybe you should have had the actors voice instead of James Earl Jones awesome voice and then you could have sold pitiful Vader.
My favorite moment is when Anakin goes after his mother and the result.
Jango Fett is okay but really gets no more justice than Boba. 
The clone planet is okay. 
The battle at Geanosis is pretty cool.
Darth Tyranus  is a rather pitiful Lord of the Sith.
Final battle is pretty cool but again this is a take down of Anakin/Vader in favor of Yoda. I love Yoda, but his skill with a lightsaber seems a little over the top.
Bottom line it's cool to see the move towards the Galactic Empire and destruction of the Jedi. Unfortunately the only Jedi destroyed is Anakin. The attempt to diminish Anakin/Vader and the horrible love story really tarnish this story."
"I have found out that this movie is best watched in bath tub. Every time Anakin and Padme are on screen, just put your head under water ""muting"" the manure and rest is quite enjoyable.

I am really sorry Hayden Christensen, but your acting is horrible pile of... (in this)"
"Attack of the Clones, like its predecessor, is yet another highly controversial and underrated installment in the Star Wars saga.

The movie is, for the most part, split between two stories. The first follows Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala which is largely a romance story. The second is a detective-esque story in which Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers two separate armies that are being built to begin the Clone Wars. Ewan McGregor's superb acting definitely makes Obi-Wan's side of the film more entertaining and mysterious, but Anakin and Padmé's story is by no means awful.

I'd be one of the first to say that the Anakin and Padmé love story has some cringe-worthy dialogue but it makes sense within the context of the universe and the characters. Anakin, a Jedi, has been taught to not love anyone and to have no emotional attachments. Obviously, he would be a little awkward when it comes to these things. Their story takes a more interesting turn when Anakin returns to his home planet in search of his mother.

The entire third act of the film is simply phenomenal. A fight with monsters in an arena, followed by the first battle of the Clone Wars, and then a lightsaber battle between Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Yoda really help elevate the last 45 minutes or so of the movie to among the best in Star Wars history. The first act also had some solid action and intrigue with an assassination plot against Padmé. The second act is definitely the weakest, mainly because it drags on a little.

The discovery and intrigue elements of Attack of the Clones definitely make it a great addition to the Star Wars saga. It's a little too long for my taste but other than that, I have no huge complaints."
"Another addition to the star wars universe. Some of the characters are lackluster however the action sequences more then make up for it. Plot is still way above par compared to the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi)."
"While far from being a good movie, it's still better than The Last Jedi."
Great! Please bring George Lucas back ! Disney is destroying the Star Wars legacy!
Some of the worst dialogue in movie history.
"George Lucas creates an epic adventure with great storytelling and incredible action sequences. Although the film suffers from poor acting, the movie is still a fun watch."
Prequels are amazing compared to the new star wars films.. we need Lucas to come back.
Welcome relief from the poisonous PC stench of Disney.
"Just seen The Last Jedi and Disney's Attempt to Utterly Destroy this Franchise with their Crazy Leftist Political Agenda; I now Love the Prequals, George Lucas we NEED you back!"
A fantastic noir/romance movie unlike any other in the Star Wars galaxy. Begun the Clone Wars has...
"To be fair, the prequels (episodes 1-3) weren't so bad when compared with the the sequels (7-9). Of course though, nothing beats the Original Trilogy. (4-6)"
"This movie seems a lot better now after watching the Last Jedi.  At least it has some awesome lightsaber duels.  Why was there not a single lightsaber duel in the Last Jedi?  Battling the guards was ok, but nothing like an actual lightsaber duel like in almost every other Star Wars movie."
The perfect Star Wars experience.
"Remember seeing this at the cinema when it first came out, liked it then as kid and still loved it now."
"the next two films in essence have the same weakness, on the positive side, a great Williams score, again, great characters, vehicles, green screen projections of star wars worlds, thrilling action and on the down side, flat characters,horrible dialogue, little to no romance, silly scenes like Anakin and Padme rolling around in the grass, plots that don' make much sense, (who would send young Anakin to be Padme personal body guard? How stupid are the Jedi, you don't need the force to see that coming!  Too much green screen and flat uninteresting dialogue kills the movie as well as an over complicated plot line that tries to force some of the story line that had been fleshed out in the original saga but falls way way short."
"Plagued with underdeveloped characters and frustrating plot points, this film continues this disappointingly hollow trilogy, despite fun action scenes."
"Hayden Christensen is the weak link in the film. Not a very strong actor. To be fair, some of his dialogue was corny and poorly written. No real chemistry between Padme and Anakin. Lamest love story ever. Anakin is just creepy and Padme seems to feel it too. Fun movie though. Great planets and creatures. Cool fight scene between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett. Big time battle sequence at the end was pretty cool."
"The worse of the prequels. This film is just horrible, the dialogue is verbal diarrhea and the acting is non existent.
I did not think it could get worse and then...the light sabre duel happened...utter drivel."
This episode was amazing and gave us what people have been waiting for since Return of the Jedi the clone wars
everything was great except the writing during the love scenes
brilliant visuals and a stunning battle in the third act! George Lucas made a much better movie than Disney could ever make!
George Lucas's best star wars movie since empire strikes back! Loved this film as a kid and still holds up in many ways.
"Boring, cheesy, and CGI'd to the point of insanity. The mildly entertaining 3rd act doesn't save this mess of a film."
"Okay... real talk time. This move is around 50% terrible. the other 50% should have been made into 100%. The Anakin/Padme plot is very weak and the two of them have zero chemistry on screen.

However! The Detective Obi-Wan plot was awesome, it was a great look into what Jedi did as guardians of the Republic. If they had focused more on that, or changed the plot around to fit more along those lines leading up to the Arena fight, it probably would have been a better movie.

I'm giving 3.5 stars become for all of its fault the movie did show us lots about the universe. We learned more about the Jedi, new worlds, new industries and most importantly we got to see the start of the Clone Wars, something that we've been wondering about since A New Hope. 

Its not a perfect movie, but it can be enjoyable if you skip some scenes."
My 2nd fav Star Wars movie!
"The worse Star wars film ever made. The unbearable love story between Anakin and Padme that leaves you feeling sick to your stomach, a villain that doesn't seem threatening at all and the incredibly cringe worthy dialogue. This film could of potentially have killed the great legacy of Star Wars on its own.    

Final Score 3/10"
After watching The Last Jedi I really miss George Lucas. I've changed my mind about the prequel movies.
They're are things about this movie I cannot stand yet some I really enjoy.
love the action. fun story too
its a pretty great movie. love the final battle
Bad movie but better than TLJ. Could have made the fight between the jedi's longer at the end.
After watching the last jedi I respect this a lot more
A solid effort from Lucas and his team. Cast works well with what they're given and the story is surprisingly well paced and consistent in tone for all it packs in
"Bad script, poor acting and love scenes, borderline criminal underuse of badass Sir Christopher Lee, nice platform for the third movie to start from i guess? , poorly done investigative drama, definitely the worst of the prequel trilogy"
Not as bad as people think.
If it were possible I would have given it 0 Stars. It's even worse than TPM.
"Anakin is left behind, being a creep and giving off a rapey vibe, but Obi-Wan is off doing cool things which is very enjoyable to watch. The Jedi Council stuff is great, the senate politics is complex and interesting. Look its not amazing, but it's cannon and better than Phantom.... Sand."
Pretty sure Tommy Wiseau wrote the dialogue.
"I love the story but the visuals were a problem for me. Most of it looked like a video game. Just wish it looked more real. I actually loved Padmé and Anakin relationship, it was cute although dialogue was cringe at times lol. I loved seeing a glimpse of bad Anakin. Loved seeing the Jedi fighting, great action too!"
Wooden acting? Check. Overuse of CGI? Check. The least-believable romance in film? Check.
"Its seem better than the previous one but storyline not as good as ""a new hope"""
"A mixed bag this movies biggest problem is the corny love story, and a few minor plot holes.  These Issues did not ruin the experience for me but are still note worthy enough that they bring the quality down.  The movie has some interesting subplots and characters, and some visually interesting scenes as any star wars movie does.  Probably the weakesy of the trilogy, If i was to give this a percent rating it would probably be around 67-72%.  I would like to give it extra because its star wars but that seems silly"
A real treat. Not sure where the bad ratings come from
Run away from some of the worst acting and storyline. It would be better if Disney disavowed episode 1-3.
"The actors in Episode II seem to be trying desperately to create a compelling story here, but the action and romance fall apart at every turn, feeling artificial and ham-fisted while one watches. I feel compelled to defend the actors though, as I imagine working with nothing but green screens and fixed tape to act as cues would make even the best of actors fail to feel invested in their scenes. The promise of sweeping battle scenes and the sagacious Yoda taking to the field of battle come crashing down when it is all reduced to so much computer-generated chicanery that doesn't hold up a year later, much less so a decade on rewatching."
Even worse than the other one. A cluster-f!?* Of CGI and some of the worse dialogue in an English language film! Utter pants!
"Gorgeous visuals, action packed, less Jar Jar. Some of the romantic scenes are awkward due to clunky dialogue and the film can be slow at times in the middle. The last half hour definitely makes up for the slower second act. Overall it's an improvement on its predecessor, but has some very awkward dialogue. And we finally get to see Yoda fight!"
"Horrible lines, CGI, and acting. One of the worst movies ever made."
"Puntaje Original: 6.0

Otra película solo de relleno, en realidad no se nota un gran esfuerzo de parte de parte de George Lucas al ponerse a grabar esta película."
"Awkward dialogue aside this movie has some amazing action, less Jar Jar, and has Yoda using a light saber finally. This movie can be a little slow in the second act but the third act makes up for it!"

"Amazing. Some cringy moments, but all in all, better than the Disney SJW movies."
not a good installment. the love story was very underwhelming
"AOTC was a mess. It's really a joke, but not remotely funny. Scenes dragged, the script is appalling and the performances awkward. Most the movie is polluted with dated CGI and meaningless dialogue. Almost every scene was irritating to watch. The most glaring problem was none of these actors have any chemistry with each other whatsoever. That is, when there aren't scenes plagued with another slew of CGI characters. The bounty hunter was the only action before that awful ending. And it was just a fan-boy addition. It was a gimmick.

The plot was a disaster. Some ideas were good, but the execution was so atrocious, I wouldn't concede that. If this was a story about Anakin, than why not focus on his desire to free slaves, not some bizarre thereafter unspoken animosity to Tusken Raiders that goes nowhere ? If Anakin was Padme's personal bodyguard, why does he never actually serve that role ? If this was a story about the clones, why have just a few brief scenes where they actually do anything. It's more about the vehicles. And if it's about the vehicles, why not do an actual good introduction to early Imperial cruisers ? Instead we're treated to Yoda who jumps around a lot, like he's Kermit the frog on a caffeine high. Dumb gimmicks intended to hide what an awful movie they produced.

And the ending, it sucked. Aside from wallpaper cast, there's a hideous arena scene where Jedi look like cheap extras. They ride around like idiots, while 3PO plays the role of Jar Jar Binks. CGI battle scenes were just as bad as the gungan battle in TPM. Meaning it didn't look a thing like SW. Lightsaber fights looked tacked on and needless, not to mention badly choreographed. The cheesy dialogue and poor performances were just embarrassing to watch. Took friend and family to see it, and caught them dozing off more than once. This one's a stinker, and it was evident from the first viewing."
"Not quite as bad as Episode 1, but that's damning with very faint praise. Has not aged well, will only continue to deteriorate with time."
"Ok yeah, minus some lines by Anakin, this movie was amazing. People actually forget that the “I hate sand line” was completely necessary to the canon of Star Wars. The reason Darth Vader does not go looking for the droids on Tatooine in a New Hope is because he hates sand. He hates the thought and feel of it due to the memories it brings with it, (enslavement, dying mother, etc). Constant action and great character development throughout. Might be the most important movie in the saga because of how it sets everything up in the story line. The hate this movie gets is COMPLETELY unjustified."
"The storyline was just average, but the acting was atrocious. Especially from Hayden Christianson. There's no doubt why his career has failed over the last 15 years. Hopefully, Episode III will provide more intrigue."
Subpar for a Star Wars film. This is the only Star Wars movie I legitimately don't like.
This was the worst Star Wars until TLJ. It’s still a bad movie but I think I’d rather watch this over TLJ sadly enough.
"The worst of the series, Star Wars Attack of the Clones only has a few memorable scenes (the last 30 minutes being the most notable) but overall fails from terrible performances (especially Hayden Christensen) and a horrible script that tries to act as a romance rather than a drama. Very little to redeem from this film, however it is still watchable."
Better than it’s given credit for
"Obi-Wan becoming the master is a great part of this, and continues the story well from episode 1. I don't dislike Hayden like many, but I also don't like him in this role either. He's ok at best. I think we all wanted that role to feel right, and it didn't."
"To be honest, I wanted this movie to be good, but it wasn't. I think that is is worse than the Phantom Menace, due to the worst dialogue in any movie ever, maybe a little better than The Room. The CG clone troopers look like they were taken out of the clone wars animated series and slapped onto the screen in this movie. In my opinion this is the worst movie out of all the prequels and the worst Star Wars movie in general. Honestly you could skip this movie and still know what is going on, even when I was like 6 years old, I did not like this movie. One star is a very generous review."
"Quizás sea la película que menos me gusta de la saga que hicieron en los años 2000, me parece muy aburrido todo el tema del romance entre Padmé y Anakin (aparte de lo mal que actúa el actor que hace de Anakin, en ningún momento se ve feeling ni química entre ambos personajes para creerte su amor).

Lo único decente de la película es Obi Wan Kenobi, que es gracias a él que esta película se salva, y todo el tema de los clones y la batalla final."
"Meh. It's Star Wars, but clearly lacking the thought-out dialogue that made A New Hope and Empire so gripping. I couldn't care less about the characters and the stakes aren't that high, given we know what's going to happen. 

Maybe a new script and the use of some live set pieces could've made this film good. Instead, we're left with a jumbled mess where the dialogue is worse than the over reliance on CGI."
"Odd romance juxtaposed with Obi Wan playing detective make an odd pair. Jango Fett, Count Dooku, and Obi Wan save the film."
"This film would not be so bad if Hayden Christiansen wasn't forced to do romance and drama scenes. He just doesn't work. He seems to do fine in the Darth Vader scenes of The Revenge of the Sith, but his performance really is the worst part of this film. Without those scenes the film would have been far more tolerable."
For all it’s flaws I still really enjoy this film don’t get me wrong it’s not up there with the original trilogy or with revenge of the sith but it’s still a better watch than the force awakens
At the end of the day the clone wars offers the biggest battle in the history of star wars and we get our first chance to see Yoda wield a light saber.  Obviously too much CGI but that was the theme of movies during that decade.  Look past that and you can see how this truly connects the dots and holds true to the Star Wars Universe.
"A decent film, certainly not great however. Anakin’s character gets in the way at times because the constant whining can be too much. A few plot holes and cringeworthy dialogue and humor detract as well. That said it successfully sets itself up for the Clone Wars series and also ties together nicely with Episode 3."
Better than Phantom Menace. Character development went a long way in Episode 2. Continues the high of good action scenes and the story is progressing nicely. The acting is a bit choppy at times though.
"Better than The Last Jedi, rather watch Anakin talk about his hatred of sand for 2 and a half hours than watch that movie for as long."
the main battle seemed rushed but end fight i loved
Better than Phantom Menace.
Improvement is the big word with Episode 2. The movie still isn`t the Star Wars magic in the original trilogy but it is much better then episode 1. The acting still suffers but the action can almost make up for it. Episode 2 is an improvement but it still isn`t a good movie.
"Had to rate this just to restore the order in the Star Wars saga. No matter how bad the The Last jedi was, this is still the worst of all the Star Wars films."
"Easily the worst Star Wars movie made, but not without its moments such as the battle of genosis or obi-wans and jango fetts battle. Also Ewan McGregor amazing portrayal of Obi-Wan makes this movie watchable."
The Worst Star Wars movie ever period
Miles better than The Last Jedi! After seeing that movie I realized how good the prequels really are. Get rid of Rian Johnson and get my boy George Lucas back or even J.J Abrams just get rid of Johnson
"Sixth best movie of all time. Say what you want about acting or dialog in it, it's a great mid point in a 3 movie plot arc and introduces us to new and exciting parts of an amazing story universe. The fight between a Jedi and a bounty hunter was alone worth the price of admission."
better than The Last Jedi
Not as bad as people think.
"Disney purposely tried to make everything George Lucas created have no meaning. 

Luke died alone 
Leia was a bad mother who spawned a evil unredeemable child.
Han died alone
The Jedi were wrong and false beliefs
The empire had redeeming qualities. 

It reeks of a corporation creating media to control or minds and beliefs while giving the cheapest of fan service."
"Better than Episode I, but that does't say much. The action is good, and I like the politics (same for Ep 1) but wow, Lucas should have hired someone to fix his dialogue and to direct this for him. Also, the over-reliance on CGI just kills me."
THIS IS THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE AND WE CANT LET IT HAVE A HIGHER AUDIENCE SCORE THAN THE LAST JEDI.
Basically everything is great except for Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman.
"Boring, slow and mostly a waste of time. The last half hour and end battle scenes are memorable. Otherwise filled with cheesy lines , bad acting and no chemistry between characters."
"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) - 9/10
Acting - 6/10
Sound/Music - 8/10
Film Storyline - 3/10
Trilogy Continuity - 5/10

Overall - 6.2/10

Although it answered many questions, it felt very crammed and the love story between Anakin and Padme' left me puzzled as it could've been executed better."
So long so boring... good watch if you need to take a nap.
Everything is great except acting.
"I MISS YOU GEORGE, I LOVED SO MUCH OF THIS FILM"
"Probably the weakest of the prequels, this film nevertheless has improved as time has gone on in my mind. There are plenty to dislike about it: horrible lines and love scenes between Padme and Anakin, a whiny cry baby Anakin, and a dull first half. However there is a dramatic improvement in the second half. The Battle of Geonosis is epic and as good as anything in Star Wars. The masterminding of the war by Sidious is fun to follow and the film is a good layover to Sith. Once again, although not nearly as strong as the other movies (although VASTLY better than episode VIII) it is still entertaining and does not deserve some of the harsh reviews it has received over the years."
No longer the worst episode in the saga
it's definitely the worst Star Wars movie ever made
"Attack of the Clones is perhaps not a step in the right direction for the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. The drama and the emotions are more awkward and unsettling than the previous chapter and even the vast imagination of George Lucas is broken apart by this completely artificial film. 

The story. The characters. The drama. The locations. 
They're more lifeless and artificial than ever before. It's almost incredible just how different Episode II is next to literally any other film. No film has such a unique shittiness to them.  This is what an uncomfortably ""personal"" film looks like by someone who doesn't understand people, emotions or basic storytelling technique. 

I'm a Star Wars fan... but ouch..."
No improvement on the boring affair that was The Phantom Menace. It was no prequel redemption unfortunately as the plot was boring and hard to watch. Action scenes involving Christopher Lee as Darth Tyranus were the ultimate highlights.
Completely boring until the end.
"Easily the worst installment of the Star Wars saga, even worse than The Phantom Menace. Anakin is now a whiny brat that blames all his problems on Obi-Wan, even his mother's death. He is also a creep around Padme and love for one another is utterly forced. This is who will eventually become Darth Vader? Plus, the Jedi Council was left unaware that a clone army was created in secret by a former Jedi Master. The CGI is overused and is sorely dated. Boba Fett is revealed to be a younger clone of Jango Fett. The final battle is visually stunning, but is only included for the sake of Lucas showing off the visual style. The final 15 minutes of the film is the only satisfying moment of the entire film."
"The second installment of this trilogy still never soars as high as any of the original films, but remains fitfully entertaining. Lucas' flaws from 'The Phantom Menace' still remain, such as an undercooked screenplay and an overabundance of busy CGI backgrounds, and Hayden Christensen was clearly not the right choice for a character who is meant to display such internal conflict. This also makes his romance with Portman fall flat, especially since their dialogue is rather shallow. On the other hand, the film has a climax that delivers to the fullest (seeing Yoda in full action for the first time is undoubtedly the biggest fanboy moment). Christopher Lee's presence is also a great contribution, even if his character has almost as little development as the previous film's main antagonist. All in all, the film is a fun blockbuster that makes an entertaining watch, despite its narrative shortcomings."
"Allowing for some dull moments, this movie has considerable visual style"
Good middle story. Not much for a stand alone.
"Actually, I thought this was the best of the first three episodes."
"If it wasn’t for Yoda, the Starwars universe would have fallen."
"As is the case with this movie's predecessor ""The Phantom Menace"", ""Attack of the Clones"" does have it's high points.  One such high point is the well produced action sequences.  They certainly help add to the entertainment value of this movie.  Also the scenes on Planet Kamino which is the location of the production and training facilities for the clone army are also well done.  However the movie is hurt by a number of flaws.  The biggest is Hayden Christensen's abysmal performance as Anakin Skywalker.  He is the central character to this movie and he fails on just about every level.  Scenes that are supposed to be emotional and dramatic come across as just plain stupid due to Christensen's poor acting ability and absolutely cornball dialogue.  Also he has no chemistry at all with Padme Amidala played by future Academy Award winner Natalie Portman.  You know there is a major problem with your movie when the best character in it isn't even a human being.  It's instead a computer generated image.  Specifically Yoda.  Still there is enough to like about this movie to recommend it.  However once you have finished watching it you will remember how good the original trilogy is."
"Corny, cheesy, could have been better.  All-in-all, unfortunately, still better than The Force Awakens."
Good movie with good fights
"Attack of the Clones is an even harder movie for me to review than The Phantom Menace. Though many see Episode II as a step up from I, I'm not quite sure. Though I've given both films 3/5 stars, I honestly have to give a slight edge to The Phantom Menace. Much of the movie feels as if George Lucas took the criticisms of ""too much talking"" in the previous installment and just amped up the action as a result. In doing so, a lot of the action feels hollow, as there isn't the greatest character development. Additionally, as many have pointed out, the acting here isn't exactly the greatest, which is a shame considering the talent on board. This isn't the fault of the cast, as they were not given much direction to work with. Despite these pretty decent-sized flaws, there's still enjoyment to be had here. Though the action is hollow, it still is well-executed and much fun to watch. The general story is also pretty interesting and fits in well with the rest of the Star Wars saga. I know plenty of people dislike how the origin of the Clone Wars was set up, but I don't mind it. I only wish we had gotten to see more of the conflict on film (rather than just the beginning here and the end in Revenge of the Sith), but The Clone Wars TV series would have to suffice that desire later. All-in-all, despite its numerous flaws, I think there is still entertainment to be had with Attack of the Clones, even though I think it's the weakest of the live-action Star Wars films."
"My least favorite of the Star Wars films but oh my god there's still so much great shit packed into this one movie!! I mean Jango Fett is one really cool dude, amiright?"
"While I did not like ""The Phantom Menace"" this film was worst. George, you got face the fact that you did way way way way too good on the originals and they can't be beat."
"The love story between Anakin and Padme doesn't feel right. Plus, the time gap between The Phantom Menace and this movie, doesn't suit the film, as too much has happened between them. Once again, this film feels way too modern and advanced compared to the other Star Wars film. It makes you question ""Why didn't they use that in the original trilogy? It seems to be very useful."" The dialogue is unnatural, and the love story is cliche. Attack of the Clones doesn't live up to what a Star Wars movie should be."
"While Attack of the Clones suffers many problems from its predecessor, it manages to fix many of them. At times, the plot still feels out of place and lost. But nevertheless, we feel like there is an objective or a finish point that the movie seeks. The action sequences are improved, but still barely above average, except the final battle. The final battle is well filmed and visualized, and best of all feels necessary and not forced. The weakness in this movie, ironically is the main character; Anakin Skywalker. At times, you would find yourself rooting against him, which is a big flaw in any movie. Anakin's dialogue and Hayden's acting abilities make it seem like a fan movie could achieve better. The whole Naboo sequence is out of place, and the love story felt really forced and unnatural at all. There are sequences such as the attack on the sandpeople, which should've lasted longer, and it could've offered plenty more development to a much criticized protagonist."
Very boring and too long.
I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
"In my opinion, this one is actually the most forgettable in the series."
"(60/100)
I dont like sand..."
"Star Wars Episode 2 Attack Of The Clones: Slowly paced, boring action an terrible writing. Episode 2 proves to be worse than its predecesor."
"Better than TPM, but Attack of the Clones still fails to be as good as Episodes 4-7."
This movie sucks balls
not better than the phantom menace but really good action sequences
This wasn't a good film. Hate the acting between the two lovers and didn't like it. The plot? was dull along with the pace of the film was incredibly slow Ewan McGregor was the only character I liked in that whole film.
I watched this mere days ago and all I can remember is thinking what awful casting choices were made. Some good visuals in the battle scenes. Thats about as generous as Im gonna be
"With this being the second story in the prequel for Star Wars, you'd think it'd be good right? Wrong! This episode continues episode 1's decent plot and replaces it with a story that feels like an eternity to watch and typically leaves me almost falling asleep with the excessive character building of Anakin and Padme and lack of action scenes, despite the very beginning being one. Overall, I wish that I could forget this episode's existence and move on with more interesting things instead. Definitely something you mustn't watch."
some weird dialogue but not enough to ruin the movie. lots of great action and good set up for ROTS.
Remove one character and the score would improve greatly.
"If Lucas could actually make a romance that isn't creepy and weird, this would have been a lot better."
"I saw this when it was first released and must have gotten caught up in the hype, because upon rewatching, I thought it was quite bad. I'm more entertained by ""Star Wars Rebels"" on Disney XD."
I think it is the worst prequel.
"Attack of the Clones does better than is predecessor The Phantom Menace but still doesn't match the original trilogy. With good performances as usual, the movie is an enjoyable Star Wars prequel!"
"This movie, I admit, has a great action apart from this is the same as The Phantom Menace. A two parallel story which is explained by both individuals about Obi-Wan and the relationship between Anakin and Padmé who will became into one whole story. But, this series is more like to focus on the romance rather than the original Star Wars as shown beyond. It's awkward and wasting too many times, although this is an important point in explaining Anakin's character who fells little by little into the dark side. Obi-Wan has a less part than Anakin although some of the scenes feel like tedious, monotonous, and awkward as well. By the way, I don't see any ""Attack of the Clones"" other than the climax. This is ""The Beginning of Dark Anakin"" which is nearly the whole story that focuses on it."
Lol a bunch of old people hate the prequels and it's ridiculous. Great movie
I hate the prequels. This is a very bad film. The prequels do prove one thing. You can have an almost unlimited budget for special effects but if the story is bad and the dialogue is bad then you are making a really bad film.
So I see some people are not for this movie I don't see why I thought it was a good movie! I noticed it got right down the action and fighting so it starts to get better as the series continues
"A very good film. Yes, the cgi was too much but fortunately we saw less Jar Jar Binks, more great action scenes, and overall a better quality film than The Phantom Menace and certainly a million times better than the Disney trash like The Force Awakens and Rogue One."
A Muddled mess. Weaker story even than TPM
I.HATE.HAYDEN he's such a bad actor
Lifeless and boring!
"Overall, I hate this movie. ""Attack of the Clones"" is a faster film than its predecessor and has some intriguing moments, but sadly it is boggled down by horrible dialogue and a horrible love story that makes this film my least favorite out of all of them. At least Ewan McGregor gives a good performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi...
 For more of my review of ""Attack of the Clones"" and movie news check out my blog at mtmovieblog.wixsite.com/mtmovieblog! It will be greatly appreciated!"
"Though it is an improvement over ""A Phantom Menace"", with better action, the movie still falls flat through bad dialogue and a dumb plot."
"Alright, ""The Phantom Menace"" wasn't that awful ... but ""Attack of the Clones"" was. Holy Shit! What a bad movie. Starting with the romance, I mean, Hayden Christensen is one of the worst actors out there, I mean ever. Neither his chemistry with Natalie Portman nor the romance itself works. The CGI, the wire work and the green/blue screen are all awful, this movie contains of the worse visual effects works ever made in cinema. As well as some other decisions and casting choices made this movie the worst of the entire franchise."
"Jesus this is terrible... 

I still want to say Hayden had something like a rookie QB with a shitty Offensive Coordinator (George Lucas,) but this is close to unwatchable if you are a true Star Wars fan. Wtf is the dialogue about sand and the cardboard characters all of the sudden? 

To listen to us bitch because sand is so coarse and rough head on over to broforcesquad.com"
This was one of the worst films I've ever seen and THE worst Star Wars film I've ever watched
"Oh God, Lucas!? What have you done to this movie!? 2002 was a really dark time for Star Wars. This is really what is supposed to the WORST Star Wars prequel and the WORST Star Wars movie IN GENERAL!!! Even though I liked the battle of Geonosis, even though I thought Count Dooku and Jango Fett were pretty good characters, even though I liked the first battle between Obi-Wan and Jango, what really bothered me the most is HOW MUCH ROMANCE IS USED!!! Anakin and Padme are a good Star Wars couple, but really their introduction as a couple is just FILLER!!! Zam Wessel was a pretty decent character in this film, but really she had so much little screentime like Venom in Spiderman 3 and evil Optimus in Transformers 5 years later. And I'll be honest, young Boba was a mediocre character. THAT'S ALL WHAT I HAVE TO SAY."
"After Episode I, George Lucas strikes back with one more steaming pile of shit. Awful CGI, empty characters, wooden acting (with the exception of Sir Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson - and McGregor too sometimes), one of the most cringe-worthy love stories ever, dozens of useless scenes, shameless exposition... Apart from a handful of sequences that could and should have been better but at least managed to be mildly interesting, anything else herein - even the action - is just plain boring."
"In my opinion, this movie was worse than The Phantom Menace. About 65% of this movie is a love story between the now kinda grown up but still whiny Anakin Skywalker. He was actually really annoying in this movie. There was more complaining from him than there was action in the whole movie! And the romance that Lucas tried to bring about on the audience was just cringy to watch. But, now on to some positives, I just needed to get those rants out of my system. The action definitely was more exciting in this movie. The Sith Lord continues to try and bring about the Dark Side of the force with an introduction of Count Dooku (the new villain for this movie.) The final battle between Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Count Dooku is exciting to watch and we even get to see Yoda fight for the first time in this series. Overall, Attack of the Clones fails to bring about the feels of a true Star Wars movie as too much attention was focused on bringing about the cringiest love story in Star Wars history."
This is not good I don't enjoy it but I like the Jedi fight scene at the end and the concept of clones
"This is looked upon by a large crowd of Star Wars fan as the worst movie in the franchise, and while I can understand why, I respectfully disagree. Far from one of the best Star Wars movies, I will admit that, but it was alright. I don't like the romance between Anakin and Padme since it feels cheesy, awkward, and I never felt like there was a spark in their chemistry, but the environments of this film look great, and the light saber fights are the greatest part of the movie. I especially love the duel between Yoda and Count Dooku. I know some people don't like seeing Yoda fighting with a light saber, but I thought it was cool that he did that. But again, the major downside for me is Anakin and Padme's relationship since it really does bring the movie down from being good."
"Way better than Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones still has some flaws but the CGI looks better."
Good film not better than the first
"Light saber battles and action sequences are filmed really well, but writing is still awful."
You know what's worse than sand?
"Attack of the Clones has a lot of clichés, it really exagerates...ejem ejem.. Shmi Skywalker... the strange development of the love story. 
But the climax of the battle was outstanding and perfect. I really liked that battle with John Williams' music."
"Credit must be given to Attack of the Clones for committing to more action-packed elements and world-building. Unfortunately, the wooden acting and often times static plot overshadow most of the good intentions, amounting to a Star Wars chapter that once again favours spectacle over substance."
"To call Attack of the Clones an improvement over The Phantom Menace would be true but it's also not saying much. There's still a half-assed love story between Natalie Portman and whiny man-child Hayden Christensen, some of the performances from anyone who isn't an already established character played by the same actor from the original trilogy or Ewan McGregor feel phoned in and some of the CGI can get distracting. I know 3.5/5 stars isn't bad but it shows that the film has enough flaws to NOT get 4 stars. There's still a 3 in it after all indicating mixed opinions. At least I'm contributing to the audience score. Anyway, on to the positive things: The visuals can be a treat when they want to, even with all the distracting CGI in the way, the action sequences are pretty fun which include sci-fi takes on car chases and gladiator matches plus an epic final battle and, as I previously pointed out, Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan is great. He's one of the few actors who appear to be committed to what they're doing and not just thinking to himself ""Money!"". True, George Lucas failed to make 2 films in a row from the same franchise on par with his own film that started it all but when you haven't been involved in filmmaking for years after losing much of your fortune when you got a divorce thus resulting in no desire to return to your own franchise, it's not exactly expected to be perfect. Lucas just tried to appeal to modern audiences who want visually thrilling CGI, not silly puppetry and childish stop-motion. Attack of the Clones may be a film that's better than The Phantom Menace but still kinda sucks with Teen Vader being grating having already thrown 3 tantrums in the film but it still becomes darker as the stroy progresses foreshadowing the inevitable events to come in the original trilogy."
This movie is in my very soul...tormenting me!
Still think it was OK.
not as bad as the first..hayden christ. is unbearable
Average movie.Better than the first tho
"Ok...How this one has a higher rating than TPM is beyond me.  This is the worst Star Wars film to date.  Why?  Dialogue.  The dialogue in this film is atrocious.  Far worse than TPM.  It doesn't help that Hayden Christensen chose not to act in the film.  I'm pretty sure a cardboard cut out of himself would have given a better performance.
The only saving grace for this film is Jango Fett, which gave us a little back story to Boba and the entertaining start of the Clone Wars.  That Jedi Battle tho, not good at all.  Wasted opportunity."
"Bad plot and visuals, but more and better action.

6.0/10"
"Trained to use the force to become a Jedi, hmm? That's Yoda"
"I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's coarse, rough, and it takes you nowhere."
Lots of Star Wars action that very fun...but wrapped in romantic melodrama and political jabbering that we really could do without.
"I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's long, dumb, irritating, and its plot is everywhere."
"I'm not sure if this or 'The Phantom Menace' is worse but both are very bad movies. Lucas tries to make us care about Anakin and Padme but in the end there isn't much reason to care about them for a number of factors: the acting, the dialogue, the fact that we already know where this is all going. It's just not very interesting. On a side note, I'm also not sure why it was necessary to have a subplot involving Boba Fett's origin story. It felt like lazy fan-service. 'Attack of the Clones' is an unnecessary installment to the franchise and can be skipped over. Even if you are a big Star Wars fan."
"I championed this second Star Wars prequel on its release because it 'seemed' more in spirit with the classic trilogy than the disappointing 'Episode 1' which, I felt was basically a kids movie sans heart. Then with the release of the quite solid 'Revenge of the Sith', I saw this one for what it was- a turgid, inter-galactic snoozefest with wooden performances, soap opera dialogue, and effects that were too ambitious for the realism they meant to acheive. Or was it simply a case of too much greenscreen for the actors to perform against? The movie is also painstakingly long and demands more attention than it deserves. Also, due to the fact that we know Anakin will turn to the dark side of the force anyway, how can we accept him as a hero? The narrative is kind of pointless (especially against a soppy unconvincing love story) and only serves to bridge the gap to the final act in the Anakin saga."
"I sincerely don't know how they managed to make this one worse than the Phantom Menace, but somehow they did it. This movie makes almost no sense, there is little to no reason for half the decisions made in this film, ranging from the whole business with Jango Fett to the laughable dialogue and petty childish behavior of what is supposed to be the main character of the film, Anakin Skywalker. I could go on and on about why Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor in this installment, but I'll just leave it at that he did not know how to convey any meaningful emotion in this film."
"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones is another REALLY underrated Star Wars Prequel. The movie is good and entertaining. Could some things to the film have been better.. Yes, but is the movie THAT bad.. No. The acting is okay, the story isn't so bad, the action sequences are to be honest not so bad. The CGI is not bad noir good. But the whole movie is good and is not THAT bad, but does have some issues."
"Episode II in the Star Wars Saga is pretty lackluster. It has some fun action sequences and I really like the emphasis on Obi-Wan's character, but the rest isn't that redeemable. The chemistry between Anakin and Padmé is awful, the special effects haven't aged as well as you might think, and the villain is very poorly done."
"Attack of the Clones is widely regarded as the worst of the prequels. Aside from some interesting character moments and sub-plots the film comes off as filler. indicated by the opening crawl, things in the galaxy are okay but are about to be turned upside down. Getting to that point however is a very slow ride. Attack of the Clones suffers from much of what The Phantom Menace did. Stiff acting and poor dialogue. Some stand outs however, that  make the material work are Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi, Chrisopher Lee's Count Dooku, and Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine. These actors portray their characters excellently and help the audience invest in the story. Palpatines scheming is more fleshed out in this film and leaves us wanting to see where exactly he plans to go.Obi-Wan's investigation into the Clone Army and action scenes are highlights of the film. Count Dooku makes for an interesting villain. He is doing a necessary evil in order to prevent further evil in his eyes. It makes for some genuinely good dialogue. On the other end of the spectrum, Anakin and Padme's relationship and dialogue is hard to sit through at times. It is difficult to relate or even believe their affection for one another due to the stiff and sometimes creepy dialogue. Some of the set pieces and the excellent music by John Williams make up for this however. There are instance where you can see where George Lucas is going and what he is implying. The greatest part of their time together is spent on Tatooine where we see glimpses of  Anakin's anger and darker side. Hayden Christensen does a good job of displaying what Anakin is feeling, especially when he sees his mother beaten and on the verge of death. The music and results of that scene are great and carry weight. The climax of the film is visually interesting. Much of the CGI doesn't hold up quite that well but it isn't horrible. The Clone Army in action was a cool sight and the camera work is unique and adds a grittiness to the battle. The ending lightsaber duel is lackluster but its's results are satisfying. Overall Attack of the Clones feels like filler with some cool visuals and character moments, held back by poor writing and abandoned sub-plots."
"why the hell George luca brings same Problem they don't fit this squinty, gently l deny he made up all over again at least action and Music sequence confidently promise Blame Boring Plot. Length Minutes, Bad Hayden Christian Performances writing no tell l get bore every wipe sequence get me bore l hear it."
"Better than Episode I by a LONG SHOT, but still heavily flawed."
"Si el Episodio Uno la considero una ""mala"" película a la que le tengo cierto cariño...esta es un desastre por la que no siento más que un odio profundo.

Y no es que esté exanta de elementos interesantes. Algo que me gusta de la trilogía es su trama política, que si bien es simplona, al menos contextualiza muy bien el universo, especialmente a la hora de construir el Imperio de la trilogía clásica.

Pero ahí se acaba todo. Lo demás es pura mierda. El personaje de Anakin es odioso y está escrito de pena. La actuación de Christensen es de escándalo (de lo desastrosa que es). Natalie Portman parece que está por allí de paso (aunque en la tercera será aun peor). Esa historia de amor....ay, madre...esa historia de amor. ¿George Lucas ha tenido alguna relación amorosa sana en su vida? Por que sin duda esta no solo no parece real, sino que es tan tóxica que da miedo. 

Por supuesto ese supuesto ""descenso a las tinieblas"" de Anakin es tan torpe (incluso teniendo buenos elementos de base) que da la sensación de que uno de los villanos más increibles de toda la historia nace de una rabieta de quincieñero en edad del pavo. La serie de Tartakovsky lo hacía mucho mejor en un episodio de 5 minutos...

Señores, estas son las bases de la gran epopeya que se construirá a continuación, y no solo son ridiculas...sino que son poco creibles.

En fin...la peor de la saga, y un insulto a la gran franquicia que es Star Wars...horrible."
Solid movie with thrilling action just needs some more character development
This movie is some hot ass
"Full of terrible dialogue, horrible casting and a couple with 0 chemistry, Attack of the Clones is the worst Star Wars movie ever made"
"Somehow a step down from Episode I, Attack of the Clones might feature more action, but the dialogue is even worse, and Hayden Christensen gives one of the worst performances in history."
"From the really bad acting to the god awful visual effects, Star Wars episode 2 definitely is, the worst Star Wars movie."
"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"", while it is more watchable than its predecessor, proves to be a worse film still. The performances have no depth to them (in particular Christensen and Portman), though we are given a great performance from McGregor. However the story lacks credibility, and aside from the battle at the end it lacks any excitement."
"DON'T WATCH IT I DARE YOU DON'T
this thing shoudn't exist as a star wars movie
reason-bad dialouges,bad acting,poorly executed action sequences and biggest thing THE TITLE OF THE DAMN MOVIE
SPOILERS




If clone army is helping the jedi masters than why the hell the title says attack of the clones 

IT JUST SUCKS"
"Solid, but not as good as the first."
"Star Wars Episode II Attack Of The Clones is often the Star Wars movie people tend to just not talk about.  It is often stated to be to long and drawn out and with out the feel of Star Wars. Attack Of The Clones, though isn't a normal Star Wars. It is a love story and a mystery story. It's very romantic yet ominous. Plenty of nods to The Empire Strikes Back. Our heros are split up and we find our characters in a dark situation. The dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is often laughed at. It is t the most real relation ship we would find in the real world. But think about it. Anakin has never really been with a girl he has the hot for before. He has spent the last 10 years in the Jedi Order where they say he has to be mindful of his feelings. He is going to come off very rough around the edges and akward. Episode II perfectly continues what Episode I left us off with despite the 10 year gap between the events of the two films. The Jedi are cautious to get involved in growing political tensions to not start a war. The Jedi are also being mindful of Anakin's training and trying to find the sith. The Mystery and investigating part of Episode II is truly the best part of the movie. Seeing what a Jedi investigation is like is very exciting. Episode II leaves many other mysteries to be left explained like Why and How the Cline Army was commissioned and why did Count Dooku leave the Jedi Order. Seeing Palpatine groom Anakin the way Anakin wants because he feel is he isn't getting the positive feedback from his Jedi Peers. Anakin's struggle in this film gives you the smallest taste of his inevitable fall from grace to be Darth Vader."
"Fun film, great action!!!"
"Really enjoyed it, had flaws but really enjoyed it also natalie portman is gorgeous"
"The absolute worst Star Wars cannon film to date. I didn't think that it could get much worse than the Phantom Menace, but boy was I wrong. This is a absolute bore. The characters are terrible and the worst of all the the primary protagonist, Skywalker. He just can't act very well and delivers just wooden lines throughout the entire film. The only saving grace is Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan. He is even given just garbage to work with through this snooze fest of a film."
"The movie that made my elementary school career. I was pulled in from the beginning and wasn't let go until the end. A great second act in a wonderful franchise, and the first that starts to add a bit of nuance to the series. I really enjoy seeing Ani grow up and find his place in the world."
"""I don't like sand""."
Good action sequences but that's about it
"The opening sequence had a need shiny ship that descending towards coruscant.  That whole part was visually stunning.  The was another part where Obi-wan and Anakin chase after a bounty hunter among a highway of airspeeders.  This movie has some good parts, like the ones I just mention.  Two good parts.  Two stars."
"In fact, this movie is a little bit better than 'The Phantom Menace', but it not reaches the quality of the original films."
"Okay, this one was better than the last, but still, the fight between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and Count Dooku was dull."
"It wasn't the best Star Wars movie ever made, but it definatly has its moments that make it stand out from the other movies in the saga."
"I once said that Star Wars Episode 5 is better than Episode 4 because it improves upon it in every way. That's what sequels should be like. However, this movie manages to do the exact opposite, managing to be even worse than Episode 1 and amplifying every problem I had with Episode 1. Awful love story, even worse acting, even worse characters, and an over reliance on CGI. Although I will give credit where it is due, the CGI looks better, but it's still pretty bad, and it's in every scene. The only interesting part of the movie for me was the war between the droid army and clone army, and of course, we only get to see at least 30 seconds of their battle."
"Unfortunately, attack of the clones manages to have the exact same results and the phantom menace. It's boring, characters have no development, the CGI is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the dialogue is even worse than the phantom menace. The story is horribly executed, and the love story has become a meme at this point because of how terrible it is."
"People like to hate this movie because of the 3% of the movie's runtime that Anakin is being an awkward teenager, and frankly, this movie does not deserve that. Ewan McGregor is BRILLIAN in this movie, and Hayden Christiansen isn't nearly as bad as people make him out to be, considering the lines he's expected to deliver. But Anakin is a hormonal teen, and honestly, his portrayal of this character is spot-on. Yes, it definitely could use some touching up, and it is not the best of the Star Wars films, but it is fun to watch, and only stupid for around 5 minutes."
"I championed this second Star Wars prequel on its release because it 'seemed' more in spirit with the classic trilogy than the disappointing 'Episode 1' which, I felt was basically a kids movie sans heart. Then with the release of the quite solid 'Revenge of the Sith', I saw this one for what it was- a turgid, inter-galactic snoozefest with wooden performances, soap opera dialogue, and effects that were too ambitious for the realism they meant to acheive. Or was it simply a case of too much greenscreen for the actors to perform against? The movie is also painstakingly long and demands more attention than it deserves. Also, due to the fact that we know Anakin will turn to the dark side of the force anyway, how can we accept him as a hero? The narrative is kind of pointless (especially against a soppy unconvincing love story) and only serves to bridge the gap to the final act in the Anakin saga."
"Another half baked, badly written prequel with the most unsympathetic, whiny, annoying Anakin Skywalker, some badly over the top action, even more CGI and a story so dull you just want to fall asleep."
"Tedious, hard to follow, and too many annoying characters that barely make this movie worth seeing..."
One of the worst things that ever happened to cinema
"Terrible movie features two CGI armies. Obi Wan's story can be a little interesting, but Anikan and Padme's romance drags the movie down."
Entertaining but too much CGI
"Although not the greatest Star Wars, there's still fun to be had. The middle of the movie can get a little slow, but there are enough elements thrown in there to keep you engaged for the spectacular finish. Some may blame Christensen for his ""bad acting"", but I think it's the script that holds him back from being a great Anakin. Overall, a fun movie that at least sets up Revenge of the Sith well."
Star Wars: Attack of The Clones is an exciting and masterful movie- from its well played characters to its epic battle scenes. One of the best installments in the series!
Nota: 5.9/10 - 2.9/5
"Also another mediocre Star Wars movie and bad acting is the main cause of it. It is a ""meh"" movie."
"Anakin and Padme are disappointing, underachieving characters. Also, a good amount of the overall chosen dialog is unnecessary. Other than those blemishes Attack of the Clones still lives up to epic Star Wars form with its action and beautiful scenery."
"Contrary to popular belief, this is far inferior to The Phantom Menace. Don't get me wrong this is still better than most movies because, come on, it's Star Wars; but the romance between Anakin and Padame is boring and something I skip when ever I watch it. However, The ending is awesome and my favorite battle scene of any movie ever!"
"Lots of action, but little character development."
"Has almost the exact same problems with ""The Phantom Menace"", but this time suffering from an incoherent plot and underdeveloped characters. Making this one a complete bore."
Objectively terrible but my heart doesn't care. Probably the best of the prequels.
"I liked this one better than episode 1, but it wasn't as easy to watch. This one is darker but has some fun action. Anakin is annoying but that isn't that bad. I'd recommend it."
Though awesome action is offered there is an abundant amount of underdevoled characters making it the worst Star Wars installment.
":l

Okay but the cloners are really great creature designs I remember being super inspired by them when i was little and tbh still see aspects of them show up in my artwork now."
"It improves with better action scenes and visual effects (and less Jar Jar Binks), though it still suffers from clumsy pacing, some lazy acting, and a forced romance."
"It improves with better action scenes and visual effects (and less Jar Jar Binks), though it still suffers from clumsy pacing, some lazy acting, and a forced romance."
One of the worst star wars movies ever because the casting and writing was horrible. Waste of money and talent. They should remake the entire prequel series.
"It is upsetting to see a film with phenomenal concept being poorly executed with unnecessary fillers. This is how the prequels should have started and then made us as viewers uncover the life behind Anakin and the rise of the clone army. Overall, the dialogue feels like a updated version of Mcbeth, the cinematography is adequate, the characters were innovated perfectly but the story made a wall that is hard to climb if I want to connect with them. Example being Anakins and Padme romantic subplot was oddly bland and didn't make me excited to see them together. On a positive note its a fun watch and great universe."
"Pretty cool, but pretty boring at times."
"When Phantom Menace was dull, Attack of the Clones leans more on frustrating with a never-ending cycle of annoying plot devices and hideous acting which I've seen repel even the most loyal Star Wars fans. For a movie that was supposed to develop Annakin's character. Episode II does great disservice to Darth Vader."
It was good could of been Better
"Honestly, this is probably the best of the three prequels. The Revenge of the Sith had no plot. It was just a mop up and with a lot of action. The Phantom Menace just sucks in every way imaginable. The Attack of the Clones has a car chase, lightsaber battles, huge battle at the end, and the closest thing you'll get to a love scene in any of the movies. Also, a narcissistic dude who kills a bunch of people out of anger. Entertaining... even if it isn't good."
"Sadly not much of an improvement on The Phantom Menace. Once again, the effects are good, and occasionally there'll be something kind of cool, but nothing cool enough to make up for the atrocious dialogue (""I don't like sand""), wooden acting and dull, drawn-out story. The love story at the center fails to engage (Christensen and Portman have no chemistry, and the character of Anakin is honestly kind of a creep), and Lucas still favors visuals over story. The Force is not strong with this one."
"It's alright. It's probably the worst live action Star Wars entry. It shows ridiculous promise, especially with Obi-Wan's scenes and Christopher Lee's scenes. Unfortunately, this promise is squandered by the awful romance plot between Anakin and Padme and lackluster special effects. Despite this, it's worth a watch."
Doesn't improve since The Phantom Menace with a load of faults and awful writing. And don't even get me started on Hayden Christensens character.
need to balance the score
"I don't like and its course, rough, and gets everywhere"
"""OK this sequel to the prequel trilogy was so bad, it made 'The Phantom Menace' look good. This here is my LEAST Favorite in the entire saga! However the visuals are not bad, the action sequences including Yoda vs. Dooku were pretty impressive, and the score is actually quite good. A few problems I have with this film is the fact that it's a romance film between Anikan and Padmé and the dialogue in this film between them and other characters are so cringe worthy on so many levels! I mean really, who talks about sand? NO ONE! It's uncomfortable!"""
"I may be in the minority, but I feel this is the low point of a great franchise. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman are beyond awkward in the romance. The high point is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. All in all, not bad, but not good either."
"MUCH better than Phantom Menace, but is still weak. However the action scenes do save this film, even if the acting and writing is bland and awful!"
Worst Star Wars movie I hated the plot but there was good effects and action.
"Interesting efforts to expand the characters, but we are left feeling like something was rushed."
"Attack of the Clones suffers from a poor leading actor, a strange and awkward love story, a pathetic villain, and once again a facade of CGI images, but Yoda's light saber skills are worth the viewing."
"Attack of the Clones has a lot of new information under a weak script, whick makes it the less compelling chapter of the franchise, but it nevertheless boasts some amazing action sequences."
The only good part of this movie was the huge battle. It was great to watch and I have gone back to this movie solely to watch that part. Everything else is pretty boring.
"The only reasons why this film is better than Phantom Menace is because (1) more scenes actually contribute to the general plot of the trilogy and (2) there were some great action scenes. Seeing a bunch of Jedi battle on Geonosis along with Yoda fighting with a lightsaber are a few things that fulfilled my childhood dreams. Other than that, this movie was poor, which was a shame due to it's great potential."
"Ever so slightly better than Phantom Menace, but still crap. At least for Star Wars. Hayden Christensen is AWFUL. His dialogue is awful (though that's not entirely his fault), but the action is pretty good, and the Across the Stars theme is great, and thank GOD Jar-Jar isn't in this movie a lot."
"This earns an extra star because it's Star Wars, but the best time to enjoy this movie is when you have friends over and you drink a truck load of the strongest beer in town. ""It's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere."" That line... cringey and hilarious at once."
"Nja, längtar nog till nr 4!"
Definitely an improvement on the Phantom Menace.Attack of the Clones was kinda great and Lucas' method of building Anakin Skywalker is well appreciated by me..
"Attack of the Clones is a great film with a powerful third act. The practical effects are actually present in the film and the effects are great for their time. It has a beautiful score by John Williams, arguably his best and has iconic/memorable performances from Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, and Samuel L. Jackson. Though Hayden Christensen is unbearably cringy, the rest of the film is truly great and my second favorite of the prequel trilogy. It also has great production design and they do sexualize Natalie Portman too much but itâ(TM)s Natalie Portman. Solid 8/10"
"A roller coaster of opinions take sway in the analysis of this film. With Lucas at the helm, many blame him for what is an all time low of acting and chemistry between Cristianson and Portman's major lead roles with the notable exception of McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi. This was not aided by a frank lack of character development and exceedingly rushed plot lines with the sudden addition of Lee's (albeit very well portrayed) Count Dooku. Though, masterful CGI and never-before seen action sequences do raise merit for the films; with epic lightsaber action and interstellar dogfights. Whilst highly criticised, the politics continues to bring an interesting aspect to this highly loved universe; not to mention, the evident lack of Jar Jar Binks was a welcome change to its predecessor. Whether fans accept it or not, the film is not abysmal, and brings new life into the dedicated fandom that is 'Star Wars'."
"In my opinion star wars episode 1 is better than this one. If I watch it I want to go to sleep. If you haven't seen this movie, don't see it. Do yourself a favor."
"Solid movie, but far from the perfection of the original trilogy."
"One of my favorites from the ever growing saga. To see Grand Master Yoda in action, the ignition of the Clone Wars, Jango Fett engage Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu, the arena battle and the genesis of the emotions that would give birth to Darth Vader all make for a brilliant ride!"
More action packed and less Jar Jar thank god!
Disappointing but better than the Phantom Menace.
"With the action better executed and the story told with energy this time round, Episode II is a more entertaining entry to the saga than its forgotten predecessor, but not exactly more impressive.  It inevitably carries the problems that the trilogy started with - slanted acting, cheap VFX, wasted A-listers - and creates new ones (lifeless romance, wining acting) that can only do less justice to the saga than ever before."
"Wonderful movie! Reveals Anakin Skyealker story in beautiful manner, with great music."
"I agree it is undeniably bad. But like Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, I enjoyed for what Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones could only offer."
"Somehow finding a way to be even worse than the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is a disaster from start to finish. The movie is centered around a horribly acted love story that nobody cares about, features more Jar Jar Binks, and once manages to disappoint fans by having Boba Fett appear, only to have him be a total loser and then die awkwardly all over again. There's all that bad and I honestly don't have one good thing to say about this movie. 

You should definitely skip this one. You gain nothing by watching this stinker."
Once again the new era of Star Wars fails to impress. In all fairness this is a much more exciting and action packed film compared to Episode 1 but still falls short of the fans expectations. It's not completely terrible and its an okay yet cringeworthy watch for a Friday night but once again this new era fails to reach the blockbuster heights of its predecessor. If you watch this film don't expect or compare it to the original trilogy otherwise you shall not enjoy the film what so ever. If you would rather consider it as a sequel to the also terrible Phantom Menace then you may class it as an improvement and may even enjoy moments of this film.
Absolutely awful film. Terribly boring and awful acting from Portman. The script is dire. Today must be the worst character in the film. Hate the way he talks and the fight scene is clearly ripped off much better films. Dull dull dull film.
not as bad as The phantom menace but still pretty bad.
"Not The Best, But Not Awful"
"The second film in the prequel trilogy, and my 3rd or 4th time viewing it, my opinions on it are roughly the same as my other viewings. It is not as bad as the previous film the Phantom Menace, but it still is a far cry from a decent Star Wars film. What props Episode II up over Episode I is the inclusion of several new characters and actors such as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), which help elevate the film over it's predecessor. Some of the returning characters and actors also help elevate the film as they either have improved from the last film, like that of Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan, or simply appear more in the film than previously, such as Samuel Jackson's Mace Windu and Frank Oz's Yoda. The CGI in the film is improved from the previous, though there are still points in which you are taken out of immersion due to the contrast between real life actors and CGI backgrounds or characters. However, this is generally where the positives end. While all of the points above sound great and make one think that the film should hold a much higher rating than the 2/5 stars I have given it, the problem lies in the writing, the core of the story, and the wasted potential of the film. The movie is messy to put it simply, the main driving force in this film is the development of Anakin's feelings for Padme and her feelings for him. You are supposed to see the two slowly fall in love and form a bond so strong that even Jedi vows can't tear them apart, you are supposed to see Anakin's slow descent and drift away from the Jedi Order and toward the emotional Dark Side. However, the film horribly fails to convince you of any of it. Even down to the barest level of emotion, the writing team does a poor job developing the characters. Anakin comes off as a whiny, brat with a down right creepy fixation for Padme. There are scenes in which Anakin (played by Hayden Christensen) literally looks like a stalker. On the flip side, Padme is supposed to be falling for him, you should see the love and chemistry start to flow between the two. But Padme only ever looks like she is uncomfortable and creeped out, she never seems in love. So when the climax between these two occurs and the love is let out into the open air, you just simply don't believe it. Couple that with the cringe writing (I'm sure we all know about the ""I hate sand"" comment), you get what feels like a romance movie that was created by a middle school student. There is so much wrong with this movie that, while I did find myself enjoying Count Dooku's presence, Mace Windu and Yoda actually doing something, and Obi-Wan improving as a character, it is such a small batch of positives that can't outweigh the horrid writing and travesty that was supposed to be the main plot point of the film. Next up in my Star Wars chronological list will be the Mace Windu comic and the Clone Wars television cartoon. I have heard excellent things about both and sincerely hope that they are leagues better than... whatever it was this was supposed to be."
"This is my favorite. Because of action, FX and drama tension."
"This movie is boring, joyless, horribly acted, and is the worst movie I've ever seen. This ruined my favourite Star Wars character as well, Boba Fett. Jango is chasing Obi-Wan and Boba is sitting there saying ""get him dad, fire!"" Worst movie I've ever seen!"
I don't even want to talk about it.
"There were so many brilliant casting decisions.  Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid...  So as it happens the one part that was critical to cast well?  It's not Hayden C's fault.  I would have taken that role in a heartbeat two and would only have been a 10th as good.  So it is."
"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is an abysmal film and an embarrassment to the Star Wars Franchise. Never before has there been a film so bad in the history of humanity, and I doubt there will ever be one this bad again."
"While I really love the entire series, I actually remember episodes IV, V and VI more than episodes I-III. 

It's nice to remember the background behind Anakin's fall into the dark side."
"This film has a few great moments but mixed in with that a pointless love story that keeps the pace of the film at a snails pace, the second half is better then the first but not worth slogging through this to watch it."
A okay cast put into a okay script with great visual effects totals into an okay movie.
"Where you'd think that this film would try very hard to be a better viewing experience than its predecessor, it surprisingly ends ups being a worse one. The story is average at best, the two main characters are horribly developed, the sense of wonder and galactic exploration is gone, and the action sequences are bland and just not that great. What's more, this film as a whole is really just a big bore, even when it's trying hard not to be. However, it isn't all bad. While the main characters might be terrible, the rest of the cast is actually wonderful. And while the story is average at best, it is (at least) much more interesting than in the previous film. The visuals still look incredible, and while the action sequences are bland, they do offer much more variety. And what's more, the film does feel darker and more foreshadowing to what is to come. While I do personally find that this is a worse film than ""The Phantom Menace"", it does try at least to do things better, and it does succeed in certain areas. It may be worse, but I do appreciate that it's trying newer things to be different than its predecessor. All in all, it's really just an average film at best."
"It,s ok but still jar jar Binks In the film"
"The worst and most disappointing Star Wars film of all time. Clunky, overused CGI make this film look like a rip off of itself. George Lucas doesn't understand how to write dialogue or direct actors yet again. The most hyped up battle in all of Star Wars lore ends up being the most boring thing about this film which is an impressive feat."
"As the story of Anakin continues, the film still has a bumpy pacing, and is still overloaded with VFX."
"Though its more intresting and straight up better  than Phantom Menace the film is brought down heavily by an awkward and forced romance,bad scripting choices,heavy use of CGI,slow uneven pacing,and underdeveloped characters but aside that it can be considered ""watch able"""
"dude, this is so much worse."
"Coming off the heels of the fun and visually excellent Phantom Menace, Episode II's incurable illness of a bad screenplay, horrible dialogue, and unacceptable acting makes it on par with Revenge of the Sith for the worst Star Wars film."
"It has its moments, but is ultimately a terrible love story with horrid dialogue and acting, and an incredible overuse of CGI. Easily the worst of the saga."
Star Wars episode 2 attack of the Clones was a good start a revealing Secrets behind the Clone Wars.      revealing secrets of Anakin Skywalker's past after the death of his mom he turned to the dark side in turmoil turned as when he became Darth Vader is known as his hatred for Obi-Wan Kenobi.       backstory with a hard on for the Clone Wars story Business movie rating of 10.1
the worst Star Wars movie but still adds many new things to the Star Wars universe has good scenery and has average action scenes
"Worse than the first one. I remember loving the Yoda fight... until I thought about how much it doesn't make sense. When you're a kid as I was when I saw it, the horrifically cheesy ""love"" story doesn't grate on you like it does as an adult."
"The even worse follow up to shit epi 1 this movie has less Jar Jar thank god but has an even worse Anakin ,stupid romance and more boring shit and wodden acting and also has the worst Lightsaber battles of the entire franchise."
Quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever put to theaters and that's saying something.  There are some unforgettable action scenes but there are also cringe worthy dialogue.
It can be sorta boring for the first 2 acts but every thing that happens on geonosis is just awesome the 3rd act alone is worth watching.
"Hayden Christensons performance as Anakin is a disaster, the relationship with Anakin and Padme is forced and cringe worthy to watch and makes me want to switch the movie off, it's my least favourite in the franchise and I'll probably only watch it if I'm drunk"
"The story arc begun in The Phantom Menace lumbered on and improved considerably in Attack of the Clones but, to be honest, it still didn't sparkle with the energy and vitality of the original Star Wars movies. The main problem here is the unbearable script with lines that are delivered in a completely cack-handed manner. The plot of this movie is much better than its predecessor dealing as it does with the production of two secret armies being prepared for nefarious reasons. There are some exciting set pieces and action sequences and good effects but the developing love story between Padmé and Anakin is clumsy and passionless. There are a few geeky continuity references which aren't really needed and add nothing to the saga. Viewed as a stand alone piece, Attack of the Clones looks good and has a dollop of big screen action but sadly it really only serves to remind just how great those first three Star Wars originals had been."
"Worst of all the Star Wars too much Anikan pad me love story

Love Jedi storm and Yoda at end best scene ever all else I could go without 

Interesting also hearing about clones and jango fett but wanted more detail"
"Attack of the Clones is certainly more action packed than it's predecessor, but features characters that don't work. Anakin is supposed to be more grown up in this film, but still acts like a winy child. Count Dooku is not intimidating at all and comes across as an elderly gentlemen rather than a Sith. Instead of Jar Jar, we get awkward romance dialogue between Anakin and Padme. Overall this film is definitely the worst in the Star Wars saga."
"My least favorite Star Wars movie, but still has cool moments in it, like the Arena scene, but still is plagued by horrible dialogue, and a forced love story."
Dialogue is horrible and do things that are different then what they had preciously said (Yoda at the end)
The only event that happens between the start and the end of the film is Anakin's realisation that it's slightly harder to masturbate.
"I love star wars but WHAT THE HELL GEORGE LUCAS?!

Just, no."
"""i don't like sand. its coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets EVERYWHERE"""
"This was George Lucas's attempt to appease the fans for what he did in Episode I. Despite the film being better, it still felt a little flat. The story deepened a bit and Ewan McGregor still turned in a very strong performance as Obi Wan Kenobi, but Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker seemed very ""emo"" and whiny. Maybe this was the director and the script's fault, but Christensen turned many (including myself) off to this character. Best part of the film is the Count Dooku lightsaber duel at the end of the film. Many did NOT see it coming and it was pretty enjoyable."
"Combining horrendous writing and lackluster acting, Attack of the Clones hits a low point for the Star Wars franchise."
"The absolute worst of the franchise. Terrible script, bland and completely stilted performances, really bad effects of CGI that overuses on top of the practical effects and making it feel like a videogame and artificially lifeless, the worst romance I've ever seen in a film, blind fan service as an insult to me as a fan, one dimensional characters and what feels like a pointless film as it adds nothing to the story."
"George Lucas tries and fails to create a timeless epic. The directing is terrible, the actors clearly don't know what to do and additionally the film is almost entirely done in green screen; this overuse of CGI makes the film look unbelievable and  looks dated when compared to modern technology. The only good thing is Obi Wan and he barely has any screen time as well as an uninteresting subplot. Just skip this one, it's not even laugh out loud bad it's simply dull. If you want that watch the phantom menace."
"With a combination of too much CG and an underdeveloped story, Attack of the Clones falls short of its potential. If you're looking for sweet action with blaster guns and explosions, then this is an excellent film for the entertainment. However, I feel there was no passion in the production of Attack of the Clones which left me feeling dissatisfied with what this Star Wars film could have been. Anikan and Padme's romance story arc is awkward as ever, and the acting and dialogue felt completely unnatural. The only character storyline that was interesting was Obi Wan Kenobi's since it actually added value to the Clone Wars story.

Attack of the Clones is just okay and very standard. 2.5 Stars"
Better than The Phantom Menace but that's not saying a lot. And Hayden Christiansen is just annoying and whiny. I'll give credit for the story though and Ewan McGregor's solid performance!
"Improvement over episode 2. Storyline is solid but lacks the intimate details from the novel which would have made it a great film. Love how the clone army was created in secret and how jango is the template. Great action scene through out the film. Also like the politics behind the scenes. 

Only drawback was the romance between a anakin and padame. Could have added a few more scenes showing how their love grew. 

Over a good film"
"It seems that every time a good Star Wars film is made, they follow it up the worst way imaginable. Never did I think that George Lucas could make a Star Wars film that was worse than Return of the Jedi. This one's awfully close. Where do I begin?!?! The plot is all over the place. Obi Wan is investigating the attempted assassination of Senator Padme Amidala and comes across a clone army made on Jedi Master Sifo Dyas' order. But in the movie, the jedi believe he died before the army could've been made. So who ordered the army?? I guess it's a plot point that'll never be answered. Meanwhile, Anakin is supposed to be protecting Padme. First of all, Hayden Christensen's acting is an abomination. C3PO can deliver lines less robotic than Christensen. He's not completely at fault though. The writers do an awful job at developing Anakin's character. This is the man that is one day going to be Darth Vader and he's acting like a whiny little brat. But I guess Luke had to pick it up from somewhere. The writers also try and force a ludicrous romance between Anakin and Padme. Christensen and Natalie Portman have no chemistry between them. The dialogue is laughable as well as the circumstances. Why would the jedi assign a Padawan to protect Senator Amidala?? Wouldn't they want an experienced Jedi?? You can pick this movie apart any way shape or form. It's just a complete mess."
SOMEHOW THIS ONE IS EVEN WORST THE FREAKIN PHANTOM MENACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Overly romantic and very poor acting and story.
"The Phantom Menace was a strong success financially, something which mostly came down to the massive hype surrounding it; yet despite the mixed reactions to the film in 1999, fans nevertheless remained hopeful for the middle chapter of the prequel trilogy. Episode II marked the moment we were introduced to Anakin Skywalker as a young man, the form he possessed before falling to the dark side. While Attack of the Clones does make some minor improvements, scars that remain from the first film still hold it back.

Attack of the Clones picks up ten years after Episode I; tensions are rising in the Republic with several races and planets leaving to form the Separatist movement. With a massive droid army at their disposal, both the Galactic Senate and the Jedi Council are concerned that war is approaching. Whilst this political struggle is going on, Anakin Skywalker, deep in training under Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) grows closer to Padme Amidala; (Natalie Portman) he is assigned to protect her from assassination while his master attempts to investigate who ordered the hit. From the offset, it's clear that there's a lot more going on here and while Episode II still has its moments of boring, drawn out scenes, most notably the scenes with Anakin and Padme, it does a better job of breaking these up with more action packed moments. From the city chase through Coruscant to the brief showdown between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, much of the action feels much more extravagant and sustained than Episode I. Not only that, but you can see the strings of the Chancellor's plans slowly coming to fruition with the entrance of the Clone Army and his careful manipulation of the Senate. In its latter half, Episode II begins a build-up process, laying the foundations for something which culminates in the Clone Wars and the film's sequel Revenge of the Sith; this is greatly personified with Anakin losing his mother to the Tusken Raiders around halfway into the film. We can feel the seeds of anger growing within him and this gives the audience a first glimpse into the gradual downfall of the character. Much like The Phantom Menance, Episode II explodes into action towards the end, only this time working to incorporate in more characters and factions into the proceedings.

While the narrative has taken a step forward or two, the characters unfortunately have not. The most glaring flaws in the cast this time come through Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman respectively. This really is some of the most awkward, forced and clichéd romantic dialogue that has ever been put on film; it's impossible to believe or take their so called ""romance"" seriously and yet it takes up a good portion of the film, distracting from the far better done action scenes. Hayden Christensen isn't a particularly bad actor; I've seen him give a strong performance in Shattered Glass, but here the material given to him drags the film down from good to simply average. What exacerbates things here is that he's the main protagonist, the one person that we're supposed to root for. How can we do this when he's constantly alternating between dull emotionless dialogue and moaning at people? For every moment of genuine emotion, there are five which fall flat. Thankfully, the other characters are again present to make up for things; McGregor's performance is great once again, creating a believable and varied portrayal of Obi-Wan. The Jedi Council isn't just sitting around in this film; they have a more realised participation in Episode II. The final member of the cast is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, who brings a relatively good performance with subdued conversation and solid swordplay to the film; considering that he's introduced towards the film's final act, I only wish he was given more to do.

Building on what was established in its predecessor, Episode II continues to introduce more diverse planets and locations to the series; the water soaked cloning labs of Kamino have a particularly gloomy atmosphere to them and on the opposite side of the coin we have Geonosis, a run-down, dusty and gritty setting which serves a strong backdrop to the opening battle of the Clone Wars. We are also given a wider insight into the Jedi temple on Coruscant and go further afield in Naboo; it's a strong step towards creating a greater scale and more far reaching worlds. These newer planets are accompanied by an expanded selection of theme songs which are swapped seamlessly depending on the location. While the computer effects worked into every shot still aren't the best in class, there are far fewer moments where characters are shoved in front of the camera, lessening the negative impact they had previously. With a few tentative steps forward in presentation, Attack of the Clones can make a stronger claim to immerse the audience, something which would be much improved in Episode III.

Attack of the Clones is really a film of two halves; one made of frantic, fast paced action sequences and the other riddled with painfully stiff and pretentious ""romantic chemistry"". It succeeds at standing above The Phantom Menace, but that isn't really saying much when you consider how flawed the two central leads are. Just as the film sits in the middle of the prequel trilogy, it does the same in terms of overall quality."
"Best order to watch Star Wars 
IV: A New Hope (original trilogy)
V: The Empire Strikes Back (original trilogy)
I: The Phantom Menace (prequel trilogy)
II: Attack of the Clones (prequel trilogy)
III: Revenge of the Sith (prequel trilogy)
VI: The Return of the Jedi (original trilogy)
VII: The Force Awakens (sequel trilogy)"
(1.5/5) Marginally better. Anakin displays Godsmack/Papa Roach-levels of hypemasc whiny angst throughout. Still racist. One more to go.
"I enjoyed this movie as a preteen but as soon as you are old enough to see past the sword fighting and arena duels you realize how unsuccessful Lucas is at portraying love, friendship, or really any emotions you would expect these characters to be feeling. In addition to this not a single scene looks real. It is a mish-mash of confused actors in fake places spouting words unconvincingly."
"Attack of the Clones is marginally better than The Phantom Menace in that the audience doesn't feel condescended to by including Muppet Baby Darth Vader and a CGI Jamaican rabbit. Jar Jar's role is scaled back, although he still manages to doom the galaxy. The plot is a little better focused than Episode I, but it is still a cartoony mess of sensory overload and wooden acting delivering painfully cliche dialogue."
"I had forgot what had I watch right after I walked out from cinema door. Unappealing story, underdevoloped characters, boring story perhaps, well, cause I really forgot what I had watch, and have no plan to watch it again."
The worst of the saga. Attack of the clones really does not know what it wants to be. There really is no plot at some moments. Then to many at other moments. Though the cast is perfect for there roles and the special effects are top notch. The saga takes a big step backwards.
"""Most disappointing thing since Episode I""(c) Red Letter Media"
I did not like this part at all :( sorry fans
"Una trama mas completa y no siente tan pesada, igual los efectos esta bien hechos, como la banda sonora sigue siendo magnifica.
Pero comete lo mismos errores de la pasada película, no hay evolución de los personajes, el guión sigue siendo aburrido, hay muy pocas escenas que son completamente útiles."
decentish film id say with a lot of good and bad bits but i get why people dont like it.
"It is beyond me how Hayden Christensen made it through the casting. He delivers his lines like a robot / clone. There is ONE SCENE in the movie where something is coming out of his mouth ""naturally"" (the scene when the lightsaber breaks / he loses it and he says: ""Obi-Wan is going to kill me for this.""). Everything else sounds artificial.
It's not just how he says things, it's also WHAT he says. When your ""significant other to be"" says: ""I love democracy"", the correct answer if you want to get laid is not ""I love dictatorship."" And HOW your significant other falls in lover after this (and many other similar comments) is also beyond me.
Overall too much going on on the negative side to really enjoy this movie despite the visual spectacle..."
Ummmmm I didn't like it. It was weird and annoying! The best things I can say about this movie is that we saw people in the original appear in this movie but overall wasn't good.
"Thrilling action scenes and visual effects make this film entertaining at least, but is a massive let-down by the absurdly shit dialogue and acting by Lucas and his cast"
"This movie in my personal opinion is MUCH better than Episode 1 The phantom menace An din my opinion is a slight bit bette rthat Episode 3 Revenge of the sith, Although this not my favorite movie in the franchaise it sertantly rivived the Star wars ssaga"
"Star wars episode 2-Attack of the clones is an improvement over the Phantom menace but still has alot of the same issues. the characters were bland, the effects were bad , and the dialogue was awful. On top of that there is a really bad love story that I didn't care about. While I did like the battles with the clones and the execution scene was great the movie overall was a mediocre excuse for a star wars movie."
"In my opinion the weakest of the Star Wars films that still had some entertaining action sequences but wooden acting, poor pacing and direction and a lack of awe and wonder brought this film down."
"Barely being saved by visuals and a more interesting story, horrible acting, horrible couples chemistry and horrible dialogue overall fill up time that could've been spent making a visually good film and make this film the absolute worst in the franchise. Full review is on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMRQq5p90RE&index=20&list=PLvBOglByjFAMzW8Fy68M-pxM-sR3vR8fg"
Worst Star Wars movie in the series and giving 4 Stars to a Star Wars movie is saying a lot. Bad acting...
The best film of the trilogy by far.
"Attack of the Clones is singlehandley saved by a stunningly spectacular final act that is both thrilling and fun. The rest of the film slogs with horrible pacing, wooden acting and a tonally confused script that never reaches the heights it wants to achieve."
"Again, I can't seem to give this a 0.5 as intended. Is something wrong with the website? Either way, this will do."
A bit boring at sometimes due too way to much talking but there's enough action to follow it
"It seems like it's the cool thing nowadays to hate on this movie in particular, but I love everything about it."
The worst of all 7...i cant believe i used to love this movie when i was little.
I think a 66% and 58% are still way to high or this movie
"Attack of the Crap. As far Star Wars films go for me, Attack of the Clones is by far the worst of the Prequel Trilogy. The direction is lacking in so many areas, the acting is even worse than it was in The Phantom Menace, and Hayden Christensen's performance almost makes you wish JarJar was there to take his place; his performance is that bad for me.
This is a 'fresh' movie on Rotten Tomatoes, why? I have absolutely no idea at all. The cinematography is too sterile and 'clean' for a universe that is meant to be lived-in and established; this is a complete embarrassment to The Star Wars Saga.
In light of The Force Awakens restoring faith in the franchise for me and millions of other devote Star Wars fans, Episode II hit the absolute low point here. On the plus side though, it can't get any worse than this prequel.

Damn you Lucas, for making the word 'prequel' a Hollywood toxin, but thank you for giving the franchise to Disney, by saving it from yourself."
"While yes, the Anakin/Padme love interest can be a little cheesy at times, the action sequences are great and the effects are superb. It also serves as great buildup in making Anakin a true tragic hero. I still don't believe it deserves all the hate it gets, but that's how I feel about all the prequel films."
"Lacking the exciting action that would make it great and the undercooked characters that couldn't fill in the roles they were supposed to play, Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones is another disappointment from George Lucas."
"Although Hayden Christiansen's acting is just terrible, this is still a pretty decent movie,"
"Of the six Star Wars movies to have featured George Lucas in their conception, 'Attack of the Clones' is by far the weakest entry. While the first installment in the prequel series, 'The Phantom Menace' may have failed to live up to the excitement and sheer brilliance of the original trilogy, it still provided enough fantastical escapism and innocent joy to allow youngsters to become engaged in the Star Wars universe as their forefathers had back in 1977. With this follow-up, however, George Lucas has drifted so far from what made his creation so beloved in the first place, and descended into the realm of dreary soapiness, shallow romance and an inexplicable obsession with glossy special effects in place of good storytelling, rendering 'Attack of the Clones' a tedious experience at best, and to date, remains the only Star Wars movie I make a habit of avoiding. 

If Star Wars were a television series, this would be the show that everyone would warn you about: ""Episodes I and III are okay, but be wary of the one where the blonde kid blabbers on about sand"" is what they'd most likely tell you. The truth is, 'Attack of the Clones' isn't as bad as it is boring, and the plodding contents of the movie actually match its equally uninspired title. Despite the disappointment of 'The Phantom Menace', Episode II was a second chance for George Lucas. With the re-introduction now completed and paid for, 'Clones' was the installment that should have made the effort to really steer the Star Wars ship back on course, but instead, Lucas drifted it further out to sea. Rather than reignite the franchise in a way that Episode I failed to, Episode II dowses the flame. 

Unlike my review of 'The Phantom Menace', in which I was relatively forgiving towards the picture due to its impossible task of living up to the original movies, I feel less apologetic towards this second installment (or fifth, technically speaking.) Set approximately a decade or so after the events of the last movie, the plot of 'Attack of the Clones' centers on an assassination plot against Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former Queen of Naboo now reduced to the role of a mundane senator, for reasons that are never really divulged. Jake Lloyd, who portrayed the ten-year-old Anakin Skywalker in the previous episode, has transformed into the slightly older and handsomer Hayden Christensen, but beyond his pleasant appearance and more advanced age, Anakin remains every inch the mopey sap he was the last time around; what a catastrophic error of judgment. At its heart, this entire trilogy is Anakin's story, and more specifically, his transformation into the dark lord of the Sith, Darth Vader. The trouble is, there is not one single aspect of Anakin's personality that can be deemed even remotely attractive or relatable in any way. While it would be a cheap shot to criticise Hayden's less-than-stellar performance, his underwhelming acting skills strike me less as a product of inexperience, and more likely the result of poor dialogue and Lucas's blatantly incompetent directorial skills. In spite of what George Lucas may have us believe, Anakin's internal frustrations are not compelling, at least not in the way they've been handled here. We all know who Anakin ultimately becomes, and his struggle between the light and the dark should be fascinating to watch as it gradually unfolds and continues to haunt the young Jedi Padawan. The trouble is, rather than come across as a volatile young man struggling with his inner demons like a Jekyll and Hyde type of character, Anakin is more like a whiney teenager rebelling against his parents (or in this instance, mentor) for not letting him stay out late. When his constant complaining and creepy lusting after Padme isn't getting on my nerves, his childish temper tantrums are making me cringe. Are we really expected to believe that this boy is going to evolve into one of cinema's greatest villains? Right now, I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief, no matter how young and naïve the would-be Vader is at this early stage. 

As events continue to unfold, we're subjugated to one of the most meticulously plotted romances to ever pester our screens, as Anakin's lust for Padme blossoms into a fully formed romance. The trouble is, much like the overused special effects, the Anakin/Padme romance is a distractingly superficial one. The movie constantly informs us that these two are in love, but at no point is there any hint of genuine chemistry between them. My thoughts turn back to the considerably more exciting romance shared between Han Solo and Princess Leia in 'The Empire Strikes Back', a relationship that began life as a unique mix of teasing and flirting, that gradually evolved into a love story. What's more, in spite of their differences, Han and Leia always made sense as a couple. Their personalities clashed regularly, but at least they actually had personalities. These cardboard cutouts we're left with in 'Attack of the Clones' show know signs of individuality. Neither Hayden Christensen or Natalie Portman appear to posses the acting talents required to bring this sterile script to life, and by the time their love finally reaches its fruition, I'm left cold. No matter how many beautifully constructed waterfalls or lush green fields ILM creates, nothing can constitute a replacement for legitimate emotional investment, which is what's really lacking here. 

The rather tedious love affair aside, what are we actually left with here? 'The Phantom Menace' at least possessed a sense of wonder, and although it was often shallow, I won't deny my enjoyment at witnessing the pod race sequence or the climactic final battle between our two Jedi leads and the enigmatic Darth Maul. There was a sense of rediscovery in Episode I that's desperately missing here. Rather than take the screen by force, the plot just sort of plods along, as though George Lucas hashed out a first draft in an evening and decided to start shooting the next day. As a special effects experiment, 'Attack of the Clones' is certainly impressive, but there's also a weightlessness to everything that occurs onscreen. The by-and-large absence of practical effects means that the universe ILM have created feels too much like fluid, completely intangible, and it's difficult to suspend any disbelief when I'm very aware that what I' watching has been generated on a computer. Ideally, the movie should have utilized a mature blend of practical and digital effects, but Lucas seemed far more interested in pushing the technical wizardry further than was necessary. 

Equally distracting are the blatant rip-offs of Ridley Scott. I know they say 'steal from the best', but I suspect Lucas took this advice a tad bit literally. With 'Gladiator' released just a year after 'The Phantom Menace', it's blindingly obvious that Mr. Lucas took 'inspiration' from the coliseum sequences and decided to incorporate them into his own works. That's all well and good, but when 'Blade Runner' is also incorporated in the narrative in a similarly unsubtle way, things start to look a bit suspicious. What's more, these said action sequences lack both the grit and the excitement of the aforementioned films, and harking back to my previous point regarding the intangibility of the visuals, its impossible to become invested in action sequences when they bare less resemblance to the power of cinema, and seem more akin to extended videogame cutscenes. When the clones do finally attack- which, ironically enough, doesn't even occur until the movie's third act- the screen is utterly void of tension. The Clones Wars have been teased ever since the original 1977 picture, with Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi discussing the mysterious period in excited hushed tones, and now we're finally witnessing them for the first time, only to be left cold by a bland struggle between digitally rendered clones and digitally rendered robots. More concerning, the climactic battle on the hive world of Geonosis is only the first battle of the Clone Wars, and with just one more installment remaining in the trilogy, it seems like a miscalculation to introduce the actual war so late in the game- bearing in mind, the franchise's name is Star Wars, not Star Senate Disputes. There's always the alternative of watching the 'Clone Wars' animated series, but ideally these movies should have focused more heavily on the wars themselves and less about their origins. 

I could discuss Christopher Lee's criminally underwritten role as the movie's new antagonist, Count Dooku, the 'insert here' replacement for Darth Maul, or Ewan McGregor's mildly decent imitation of Alec Guinness, but it all seems so inconsequential when considering that the movie failed to grab me in the first place. My inability to invest is what ultimately ruined the picture for me, and if you're audience doesn't care about the characters, then they're even less likely to care about the events transpiring onscreen. 'Attack of the Clones' amounts to little more than a visual effects experiment, with George Lucas's rushed script and lazy directing adding up to nothing more than an excuse for ILM to work their wonders. I'm not against experimentation, but can't escape the notion that it feels irresponsible to do so in a franchise as renowned and beloved as this. I appreciated the visual effects in Episode I, but by Episode II it all starts to feel a little overwhelming, and without a decent narrative thread running throughout this series worthy of investment, I feel hard-pressed to recommend 'Attack of the Clones' to anyone outside the Star Wars fandom. Watch for the purpose of completion, but ultimately, this is a very hollow and underwhelming affair at best, and nothing more than a necessary step closer to 'Revenge of the Sith.'"
The biggest flaw with this film is that it doesn't feel like Star Wars in the slightest. A poorly written love story and teen angst leads a film which is a step back from what should have been a major step forward following The Phantom Menace.
The interesting sequences and locations used in the movie were significantly bogged down by the cardboard cutout characters crowding the foreground.
"This movie is the worst thing made by man since Chromebooks... okay maybe not that bad, but the absolute worse Star Wars movie. Outdated CGI, forced love story, and WHY is Yoda fighting, ruins his whole character and backstory, yes size does matter when you're sword fighting with a full grown man, thanks for ruining Yoda George Lucas."
"It may try to improve upon the previous instalment's problems, but all it does is build upon them, with ugly CGI environments and exposition beyond comprehension, it feels very obligatory.

D+"
"Grade: F (9%)
Rating: 0.9/10 - God Awful"
"The more I watch it the better it gets. Sure this gets the most ""hate"" for the prequels, but it becomes clear that it is designed to mess with your heads. It's Ep5, but not. Inverted and the beginning of the end of the old republic and the downward spiral towards to the Empire, which for many is hard to watch in a 2hour episode, but when viewed as part of the whole 12 hour movie, is an excellent chapter. If only GL had followed through and revealed Jar Jar to be who he really is: The dark side equivalent of Yoda!"
"you really start to see the political ramifications take effect, maybe pacing is a little slow at times but it does add a lot to star-wars and gives a sensible and clever beginning to Palpatine rise to power and Anakins decent to the dark side."
"Anakin is a little whiny bitch who hates sand and cries about everything. Oh yeah, and lightsabers."
"es buena pelicula, me gusto más que el episodio 1 pero igual esta pelicula es un poco floja, pero igual, se me hace muy buena pelicula"
Boring at times and downright stupid at others.
it may not be good but I think its good worth watching I liked the dooku fight and the rest of the genosis battles also jango feat he seemed pretty cool yodas now CGI In stead of puppet i think i understand its the most hated but i don't 3 1/2 stars and 77%
Not a terrible movie but could be way better to much of a love story. Poor Hayden Christensen has terrible lines written by George you know what.
"As my Podcast partner in crime Sean Kennedy said ""Episode II really is the shit smear of the whole series"". I am inclined to agree wholeheartedly with that assessment. It is almost utterly without any redeeming qualities.
Horrible title, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible CG overkill, and just terrible from beginning to merciful end.
Shite Shite Shite upon piles of more utter shite.
If you thought it couldn't get any worse for Star Wars fans that Episode I, think again. This is a stinking pile of fetid warthog innards with a rancid 3 day old turd atop the summit."
"The worst of the prequel movies. Flat dialog read with the same passion you would read your shopping list, is not what you want to see in a sci-fi epic. The most painful part of these movies is that I believe they really could have been ground breaking and unforgettable."
"love that this is classified as a 'cult movie"" no it was a major studio release that did quite well at the box office not some over looked or almost forgotten flick that's the definition of a 'cult movie'"
Another George Lucas success! ð???
Mucho mejor que la anterior. Attack of the Clones muestra una increíble batalla entre los Jedi y los Sith.
"In ""Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"" (2002), a grown-up Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is charged with protecting Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) from some mysterious person who wants to kill her. Meanwhile, the Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is on a mission to find out, among other things, the purpose of the creation of a strange new army of genetically identical clones. A third plotline concerns Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and his increasing consolidation of power in the Galactic Senate under his supreme command. Much of this latter plotline parallels the fascist rise to power in Germany and Italy, and serves as a cautionary tale for our own time.

The movie does a lot in the way of fan service, but which will be fascinating to viewers if they have no familiarity with the series. For instance, fans of the original trilogy were likely long interested in seeing what kind of fighter the short green Henson-creation Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) was, and they get to see his frenetic style for the first time in this film. Even a newcomer to the series will delight.

The Star Wars franchise is and always has been space opera, so the amount of vitriol this film and the other prequel trilogy have received seems disproportionate in retrospect. ""Attack of the Clones"" is a fun, fast-paced popcorn Sci-Fi / Adventure movie. No doubt some of the criticisms are justified. Hayden Christensen DOES give a wooden performance, and some of the CGI in the film didn't even look good at the time. So it goes."
Star Wars 2 was good it got down to fighting and there where Funny parts in that movie and good fights. You will see that Aniken Skywalker was a good fighter and same with Obie one they are 2 good fighters so I would see this movie if you are a Star Wars fan. The music was good.  This movie has funny parts with Anakin and Obi-Wan  Being so sarcastic to each other. And Count Dooku was funny and sarcastic he made me laugh a lot! The battles with the light sabers where great to see! So much more to this movie was great!! See the battle good Vs evil and it will blow you away! Pick your side of the Light side or the Dark side
6.7/10 - slightly better than Episode I
"Star Wars Attack of The Clones, does a little bit better than the Phantom Menace, but it's still a disappointing movie, even though it gets better at the End with the introduction to the Republic Clone Army, and a new villain called Count Douku, also know as Lord Tarnus, played by the late Sir Christopher Lee, it does a better job keeping you in it at the end, a little at the beginning, some what in the middle of the movie. But it gets better in the next movie."
Terribly written and horribly acted only some enjoyment is found within the third act
Attack of the Clones is pretty good! It's not as bad as The Phantom Menace but it's not as good as Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi. I cried when Anakin's mother died in his arms. The battle in the pit thing has always been my favorite scene. And Yoda is always going to be my fave!
"The worst of the three, dull characterization, a mind blowing plot that is only mind blowing because of how the characters act unaware of the evil work that the villains are so clearly behind you must think the jedi have never known the meaning gullible, as for the forced love story u feel is not real but that we are forced to be told they are in love in horrendous dialogue, as well as emotionless fights between clones and robots that the audience feels no connection to, everyone feels like an alien, I can't relate to any character as a human being besides Ewan McGregor s charm which was much improved from the phantom menace, but too many shoe horned characters that did not need to be told such as a specific bounty hunter, and the huge ripping off of homage from empire strikes back yet failed to capture the magic and depth of characters, and the emotion of the scenes, clone wars is one of the worst block buster films I have ever scene in my life. if u are a romance lover you will not enjoy the forced and terrible love subplot in the mess."
I thought this was fan-fiction. lol
Another amazing film loved the clone battles
"Slightly more interesting than the last entry, but still infuriatingly slow and visually overpopulated."
"There is no lack of vision in this one, yet it leaves something to be desired - maybe about twenty minutes less and a more neatly compressed third act. The opening scenes include a lot of action on Corsucant that showcases an older and more dangerous Anakin Skywalker as he is trained by an increasingly skeptical Obi-wan Kenobi. While Star Wars is known as being a visionary trend setter, I couldn't help but acknowledge that we have seen better futuristic city traffic in The Sixth Sense, and vastly better futuristic advertising in Blade Runner and Verhoven's Total Recall.

Attack of the Clones also features the budding romance of Anakin and now Senator Amidala - awful. It's not just that the acting and script are not great, they are actually bad at parts. The superior performances go to Ewan McGreggor, Samuel Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Yoda. In fact, McGregor, Jackson, and Lee have better chemistry with completely animated characters than the two actual human actors who are supposed to be falling in love do.

The last, and worst flaw of the otherwise entertaining film is that it not only looked like it was made to be a video game, but it actually moved like a video game in more gratuitous ways than the pod racer scenes of Episode 1. THe most gratuitous example of this was when Amidala was timing her leaps and bounds to avoid obstacles on a droid assembly line convert belt. I almost felt like I was holding a dual shock in my hands, and by the time all hell broke loose in the insect-like alien arena, I found myself wondering why somebody just didn't enter the Konami code and get it over with.

Other than the city scenes in the opening act, there were some other really great parts of Attack of the Clones. The scene where Obi-wan found himself in a mysterious floating civilization that happened to be producing a clone army was not only visually interesting, it was almost just plain interesting. The character Django Fett was a well designed villain who provided backstory to the popular Boba Fett from the first series. The political sequences in the movie worked, and were minimal, but moved the story along without taking too much away from the action. Anakin's first step toward the dark side were well illustrated, and the light saber fighting was for the most part excellent, including the long-awaited debut of Yoda's light saber skills.

With all of the good scenes and visuals in Attack of the Clones, it's a shame that it wasn't put together with a little more pace and purpose. It's still rewatchable, but I did find myself zoning out a bit during the thickest chunks of clunky dialogue."
This film is really boring until the end. It has a love story worse than Twilights and ruins Yoda in my opinion
Attack of the Clones is just plain bad.Hayden what have you done.
Better than The Phantom Menace at least.
"Filled to the brim with tiresome exposition, incredibly wooden dialogue, and a story that strongly lacks any semblance of fun, apart from the imagination and visuals presented, Attack of the Clones is (as hard as it is to say) a pretty hard one to sit through."
"The biggest disappointment with Attack of the Clones is that, while it addresses many of the issues with The Phantom Menace, it adds its own issues to the mix. Like the previous film, it has many great moments--the chance to revisit the Tatooine homestead is nostalgic bliss, while the water-world of Kamino is unsettling in the best possible way--but the whole is less than the sum of its parts."
"the relation between Anakin and Padmia is so forced and you just don't believe it. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan  is the best thing in the movie. Hate Yoda with a lightsaber, the love dialog is forced, and the title makes no since. It should have been called Star Wars Shrowd of the Dark Side. Still better than Phantom."
"With bad acting, bad dialogue, and a lot of CGI that makes the film look like a video game, Attack Of The Clones is sadly, the worst Star Wars film in the series."
The force in this movie is with Obi Wan but not with Skywalker...with this performance it was just a question of time until he stepped over to the dark side....of acting
So you want to watch a movie so unbearably bad and cringe full that it scars you forever? Watch this.
"With non-stop action detracting somewhat from the paper doll characters and plodding backstory, Attack of the Clones one-ups its predecessor...but not by much. All of the criticism aimed at The Phantom Menace pretty much holds up here for this even busier sequel where - again - very little happens. For all of the frenetic action, you'd think that something must be happening (the original trilogy name-checked The Clone Wars numerous times), but it's all just plasticine window dressing for what amounts to someone else's video game adventure played out on the big screen. As an example, there's one scene where our (anti) hero rides a completely CG-rendered cow-like creature and falls off for comic effect. What's more distressing than the fact that it's not at all funny is the animal's lazy design. With laser-sharp study skills, Disney animators observe the movement and mannerisms of an influence before designing, drawing, and animating a new species. What, George Lucas and Company couldn't watch video of a bull ride before putting pixel to digital paper? The horror show that results looks awkward and just plain uninspired which pretty much sums up the entire viewing experience of Attack of the Clones. 

In this PG-rated sci-fi adventure set ten years after initially meeting, Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé, while Obi-Wan investigates an assassination attempt on the Senator and discovers a secret clone army crafted for the Jedi. 

Seeing (now) Oscar winner Natalie Portman try to work her skills around insipid dialogue and a wooden co-star in Hayden Christensen proves painful, but the digital effects are every bit as soulless as the acting. The only one who gets it is McGregor, who runs in cadence with this chapter's runaway carnival ride feel, needless exposition thankfully falling behind the smoke and mirrors of mindless thrills.  

Bottom line: Attack the Blockheads"
"The weakest part of the prequels, I think. It's jus poor, even though some action scenes are truly fun to watch like that of a fight between Joda and the villain."
"Star Wars Attack of the clones is a better movie than The Phantom Menace in my opinion.  Attack of the clones has more action and a bit more excitement.  The visuals are good again, The music is great as it always is and the lightsaber duels are well done. There is hardly any Jar Jar Binks and Ewen Mcgregor and Ian Mcdiarmid are great in their performances.  And then we get to the bad points again.

1) The dialogue in some scenes is cringeworthy and isn't good, especially the love scenes with Anakin and Padme.
2) Boba Fett shouldn't of been put in the movie at all, Jango Fett was fine but he could of mentioned he had a son or not at all.  It kind of ruined the mystery of Boba Fett.
3) The love story between Anakin and Padme was cringeworthy and could of been done a lot better.  Some of the things Anakin says to Padme, you wouldn't say to a girl in real life, it would just scare her off like.
4) Some of the scenes shouldn't of been In the movie, like when Obi-Wan goes to that diner and is asking that chef about the poison dart and Kamino.

I thought Hayden playing as Anakin, he did ok, he did the best he could of done with the dialogue and everything he was given.  I think his best moments is when he says nothing and stares or looks annoyed, he pulls off a good angry face.  I also liked in some scenes where you can kind of see his beginning on the path to the dark side.  You can see his anger, his frustration, he has a hard time of letting go of things, he's a risk taker, he's impatient.  It's all the things that lead down that dark path, I thought that was ok to be honest.  

Attack of the clones is a good movie, if you can tune out from the love scenes and ignore some of the dialogue."
Worst Star Wars film.
"Better than The Phantom Menace. I wish the deleted scenes would have been added to this film. It would lengthen it by about 15 minutes but would help the film overall.

Rating: B-"
"Disgusting, NO STARS!!!"
"Clones, lightsabers, droids, bounty hunter v jedi fights, Yoda in action! This movie will blow you away!"
"The story is dull, the acting is wooden, and worst of all, no chemistry is felt between Anakin and Obi Wan. Instead of letting a romance naturally flow out of a great story, Lucas forcefeeds an awkward love story in what is the least-Star Warsy Star Wars film in the entire saga."
"So much has already been said about this movie's wooden acting, over-reliance on CGI, and flat characterization, but there are a few specific problems that I have always bothered me about this film. 
The first huge problem is the casting. While it might be easy to blame Hayden Christensen for ruining the movie, he has the exact same whining delivery that he did in Life as a House a year earlier. Just like Jake Lloyd, Hayden has been blamed for what is essentially a lethal combination of bad writing and horrible casting. Oddly Natalie Portman, who gives an equally flat performance with equally nauseating dialogue, has avoided the criticism directed at Christensen. 
Many people have criticized awful lines like the infamous ""I hate sand"" monologue. However, I think these scenes could have been (partially) saved by simply removing the dialogue altogether. So much of the sexual tension between Han and Leia in Empire was created with minimal dialogue. In the prequels every emotion, every motivation, every thought is awkwardly explained in a completely emotionally vacant fashion. Instead of allowing the audience to live through anger, romance, friendship, suspicion, the filmmakers tell the audience what emotions are at play. Notice how many times the characters say, ""I feel..."" This lack of emotional sophistication is a major factor in the failure of the prequels. 
While Jar Jar's role is thankfully stunted, C-3PO is given an extended, childish sequence that feels forced. If you watch the original trilogy there are no moments that even closely resemble this lowest common denominator slapstick. C3PO, who doesn't belong in the prequels anyway, has always been the comic relief, but his humor has always been directly related to the action of the plot. Even at his dumbest in ROTJ, C3PO is still driving the story along. He is necessary for the scenes with Jabba. He is an important part of the agreement with the Ewoks. In Attack of the Clones, he can literally be removed from the entire movie and it would make no difference. 
This leads me to my next big problem: terrible villains. Christopher Lee is an amazing actor and usually a fun villain. However, he is given nothing to work with in this movie. At first it looks like George is playing with some ambiguity regarding Count Dooku: Is he a bad guy or just a Separatist? Why did he leave the Jedi? Are they mad at him for leaving? Is he mad at the Jedi? But instead of creating a dynamic, layered character, they simply make Count Dooku a standard bad guy with no special power, motivation, or even clothing. When it comes to the big fight at the end, there is nothing at stake. He shoots lightning. He has a red lightsaber. 
Which leads me to my next issue...Yoda and his lightsaber. I am definitely not the first person to express dismay at Yoda, whose lack of physical prowess is exactly what makes him a dynamic character, is reduced to flipping around like a ninja. This would have been a great opportunity to showcase some new Jedi powers that we had never seen before. They could have demonstrated that Yoda is beyond using weapons and merely needs the Force as his ally. But alas, they created a video game. 
I could say more about the illogical speeder chase, the misguided use of Samuel L. Jackson as the serene Mace Windu, Naboo's utterly confusing democratic monarchy (they elect teenage queens?), Jimmy Smitts and his British accent, and so much more. 
These issues, however, only address pieces of a larger problem. From the flat dialogue to the sterile CGI environments, this film has no heart and soul. Moments like Luke looking silently at the two suns of Tatooine or Han bickering with Leia in the asteroid belt or Chewie yelling at Vader when he's revealed in Cloud City, these are the moments that we connect with as an audience.
I must admit, however, that there are a few positives. Ian McDiarmid proves once again that he is the only person capable of uttering George Lucas' dialogue, and the rainy ocean planet was an interesting location. But these minor pluses cannot outweigh the enormous negatives. 
In the end, it's only a movie, but it's also a lost opportunity."
"Good movie, but there's a few flaws that stand out.  Practical effects always adds realism, and filling in just a couple plot holes.  Hayden Christensen did a great job for what he was given.  I won't hold any of his somewhat ""cheesy acting"" scenes against him.  Actors follow what the film maker wants.  So its not his fault that the film maker didn't focus on giving him more drama lessons.  Oh, and if it were up to me, I would have given the role of Count Dooku to Frank Langella"
"The second movie of the prequel trilogy is better than the first...but still leaves some to be desired. With ridiculous characters moved to the backdrop and even better action sequences, this is another fun sci-fi adventure that reveals even more about the Star Wars universe. However, it goes wrong by delving into boring political subplots and diverges from the epic drama that makes Star Wars so great. The beginning of Anakin's departure from the Jedi is also boring, with just a couple effective moments thrown in, but overall leaves episode 3 with a lot of holes to fill in. Another solid entry, but don't expect to fall in love with it."
"Great movie and great addition to the Star Wars saga. It has a major focus on the events that happened in Anakin's life that pushed him towards joining the dark side in episode 3. This movie made it easier for me to understand and empathize Anakin and his transformation to Darth Vadar. But I found that some dialogue was poorly written and some scenes unnecessary and poorly done. This movie could have been done better, but did a good job showing the beginning of the darker side of Anakin."
Star Wars II: Attack of the Terrible CGI
This movie is BORING.  Noting happens for like 2/3 of the movie and it also contains the worse love story in movie history.  Every time Anakin was onscreen I was either checking out or laughing at his acting.  The last 3rd isn't much better because it turns into a video game you're watching someone else play.  Bad guy sucked and the last fight sucked.  How did we go from Darth Maul to some old dude?  Jango was cool.  I'll give them that.
"I hate this movie. It's painful to watch. It commits the worst sin a movie can: being boring. There's not much else, just uncomfortable dialogue, silly over choreographed ""action"" scenes, and in a feat of almost impossible stupidity the moron George Lucas has made a confusing, over complicated plot actually pointless, boring, and amount to absolutely nothing. Good on George Lucas, you subhuman piece of self admiring garbage ."
"Better in Some Ways, Worse in Others

Originally Written May 16, 2002--
Set ten years after the events of ""The Phantom Menace,"" the Republic continues to be mired in strife and chaos. A separatist movement encompassing hundreds of planets and powerful corporate alliances poses new threats to the galaxy that even the Jedi cannot stem. These moves, long planned by an as yet unrevealed and powerful force, lead to the beginning of the Clone Wars -- and the beginning of the end of the Republic. In the middle of all this chaos, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Sen. Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman).

I really wanted to like this new Star Wars adventure. After the disappointment that was ""The Phantom Menace,"" I truly hoped this one would be a lot better. I'm happy to report that it is better in some ways, but frustrated to report that it's worse in others. While George Lucas has expanded his storytelling capabilities with amazing CGI advances in the last ten years, what suffers the most here is how wooden the acting is, how awful the dialogue is, and when there's no CGI candy to spice up the screen, how painful it is to watch. We all know that Anakin and Padme are destined to become the parents of a pair of twins named Luke and Leia, but there is exactly zero chemistry between Christensen and Portman. Luckily, the best part of the film occurs in the last 45 minutes when we get to watch the beginning of the long promised Clone Wars begin. And when yes, a certain diminutive Jedi FINALLY gets to show off his stuff! Three stars out of five."
excelente pelicula.. Anakis se esta acercando al DarkSide
It's my least favorite Star Wars movie because of Anikan and Padme in love. Their love just doesn't function.  But the big arena fight was pretty cool.
better than the first part
"Attack of the Clones features a poor performance by Hayden Christensen playing the main character Anakin, an occasionally bad writing and it definitely is the corniest Star Wars movie. However, I still like this film. I like the story and the action is superb. I also like some of the characters here like Yoda, Mace Windu etc. and, yes, I like Padme (mostly because of her looks, though). I think that Dooku is a more interesting character than Darth Maul, because he has a better character development, even though it is slightly lacking. Also, the Bounty Hunter lacks character development. So, i'm definitely not a fan of this movie, but it's better and improved from it's predecessor."
"For its story, Attack of the Clones is surprisingly slow, but has some stellar setpieces. Even more than the first movie, Episode II is hampered by its enormous reliance on CGI. Not having a single clone be a real person in a suit is really tough and dates it immediately. At that point the movie is practically half-animated."
Really liked the back drop to it even though not a big d SyFy person.
"Chaos.  There are just too many things going on in this movie, when the two things that should have been focused on were the love story of Anakin & Padme and the clone wars.  There are always some action sequences that redeem the movie overall, like the bounty hunter chases on Coruscant and Kamino.  The arena battle is unnecessary to the story."
"In my opinion Attack Of The Clones is the worst movie in the Star Wars saga. It has worse acting and CGI than The Phantom Menace, the plot about the secret clone army that is being built for the republic is pretty stupid, like seriously how do you not know about an army being made for you. There were also a bunch of side plots in the movie that were irrelevant to the main plot. The love story is cringe worthy and Hayden Christensen is so bad in this movie it's unbelievable. Attack Of The Clones has some upsides like the arena battle scene or the scene where Obi-Wan and Anakin are chasing a bounty hunter through the city but besides that there isn't much to like about this movie."
hands down the worst star wars movie
"Too many boring, dull talking scenes. The lore is explored in cool ways but it still is just talking and often contradicts itself. If I had a top 10 list for my favorite Star Wars movie moments, I'd have one for every movie, except for Attack of the Clones. Even the lightsaber fight is underwhelming. Yoda flipping around was just stupid and out of character."
"Predictable, and irritating, the wars continue drudgingly. You often wonder what prompted Lucas to make this trilogy and then to make it badly. Is it a phenomenon common with commercially successful directors - once you make something that is purely commercial yet good, you have no idea how to follow it up so you go formulaic and destroy it all? Aside: the romantic angle was so devoid of emotion and bereft of art, that it left a bad taste in the mouth. The beauty of 4,5,6 was that the romantic angle was downplayed and fun. Here, it was worse than commercial Bollywood."
"Christensen's acting makes this such a hard watch. Even McGregor wasn't great but I think his performance was at least believable. It was exciting to see the clones knowing what would become. For me, the prequels fulfil my need for more Yoda and more lightsabers so to be honest, that fills that quota. Still an entertaining watch but nothing ground-breaking happens like in the next episode. Except maybe we accept that Anakin's a little shit that doesn't do as he's told!"
"George Lucas continúa hundiendo la excelente trilogía de ""Star Wars"" con esta confusa y reforzada segunda entrega de precuelas, con actuaciones de lo peor y con unas batallas que son tan rápidas que no se pueden apreciar si usted parpadea.  ""Attack Of The Clones"" se define con 3 palabras: aburrida, aburrida y aburrida.  ¡Y ni hablar de los diálogos de pacotilla!"
A better love story is starting to develop even if Anakin is totally unlikeable and Ewan McGregor saves it all.
"Even as a child, this installment of the Star Wars saga never stuck out to me as much. Perhaps it was its sporadic dragging throughout the film, or its hammy romantic subplot. Nonetheless, Attack of the Clones is more bearable than its predecessor thanks to some a cast that seems more interested in the material, and some admittedly solid action sequences (though the CGI overabundance hurts it to a degree). Verdict: C+"
Horrible Acting.  Horrible Writing.  Horrible Directing.  Horrible choreography. It felt like Lucas just didn't care about giving a good product for this one.  The only good thing was the special effects.  Maybe that's where all the resources went.
"Slightly better, but no great improvement."
Underrated Star Wars movie
"Slightly better than the previous episode, but still full of horrible acting and bad dialogue. R2D2 and C-3PO are the best ones in the film and that isn't saying much."
"On my second watch after a decade the movie felt even better than the first time round although it's not as good as episode 1. The visuals are a treat to watch, the story-line a mixed blessing, while the overall plot is intriguing and interesting, it's overshadowed by the love angle and the stupid adventures of the Jedi knights. The advisory to the Jedi's plays a central part in the franchise and this time he didn't feel as villainous or sinister as the previous ones. Hayden Christensen as Anikin Skywalker is a mix blessing, there are moments when his performance looks like a bad act of a lecher or a hot head and other times we can see the birth of Darth Vadar in his expression. Still a Star Wars movie is a fun entertainer."
"I hate sand, it's coarse and it gets everywhere."
"This film, in my opinion, is worse than the Phantom Menace. This is mainly due to over-the-top and unnecessary CGI, a poor performance by Hayden Christensen and a plot that fails to take off until 2 hours into the film itself. The only benefiting scenes in this movie are the ""Jedi vs Droids"" battle and the ""Yoda vs Dooku"" fight scene. The music by John Williams is still perfect, but it is all wasted on a poor spectacle that desperately tries to be good. And, to top it off, the script for Anakin and Padme's love story is more than horrible."
"Probably the filler movie in the prequals, not much happens as its mostly fluff and chitter chat. Anakin is portrayed as a whiny little boy, its frustrating to watch but crucial in the story as Darth Vaders story develops. By far the worst in the whole Star Wars franchise."
"A considerable improvement from Episode I, Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones is visually dazzling, but suffers from some cliched dialogue especially around Anakin and Padme's love story."
"Attack of The Clones suffers from undeveloped characters, bland acting, love scenes that make you want to gag because of how bad the dialog is, and a dull sterile environment plagued by CGI elements in places where there really doesn't need to be."
"Phantom Menace has in many ways fallen into modern parlance to mean all that is terrible in the world, somehow this absolutely steaming turd of a movie seems to have escaped the same punishment.  It's almost like the critics couldn't quite believe that this is in fact worse.  It's so dull...I mean mind-numbingly so, there is nothing at all here to keep you entertained or otherwise engaged.  So, so much worse than I remembered."
"Probably the least in the Star Wars universe, yet it gives important insight to Darth Vaders rise!"
"Rating: 54%
With an unnecessary romance subplot, less entertaining action, and shoddier work on the script and visuals, Attack of the Clones is obviously the most disappointing out of all the films in the franchise."
Still cheesy but not as bad as Episode I. The action helps. Horrible acting still by Natalie Portman & Hayden Christensen.
Worst movie in the franchise.   Hayden Christiansan can't act.   The romance was unbelievable and forced.  New lore concerning the Jedi sucked ass making them anti-love bad guys.
Criminally underrated.
Its definitely the worst of the star wars movies. The ending was the best part. they wasted tons of great characters to set off for the last movie. still something you can sit through though
Again an improvement from the Phantom Menace. Really really nice graphics. Had a very slow start. But after that the last 45 minutes was a really epic battle. The fight scene between count Dooku and Yoda is really awesome and it sets up the death Star which is really cool. Overall pretty good movie could be better though.
"Ugh. Couldn't wait for this one to end -- a total mess. So much CGI, so little character development (other than Anakin embracing hate -- but c'mon, if your someone messed with your mama, you get what you deserve! And the sappy little love affair with the Senator does not count !! It was nauseatingly saccharine -- i felt like i was watching a young teen drama instead of SW! ) and even Yoda coming to Obi-Wan and Anakin's rescue in Geonisis was a joke. Whatever happened to the simple storyline of Ep. 4/5/6 ?"
Better than Phantom Menace... but the love scenes were drawn out and overdone.  The rest was ok.
"If you thought the Phantom Menace was bad, then just wait till you see Attack of the Clones (its even worse). Have fun trying to watch George Lucas tell an absolutely terrible love story that is just cringe worthy every second. If I can give something positive. I guess Jango Fett is cool, but there is not much else to say."
"Gotta say, I think Episode 2 is a lot better than people give it credit for.  For whatever reason, people hated Hayden Christensen playing Anakin Skywalker.  I, on the other hand, think he did a fantastic job (in this and ep. 3) showing the emergence of The Dark Side.  He shows those emotions quite well.  This installment has a really cool war sequence where we get to see all the Jedi's fight, even Samuel L Jackson.  Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, for being so old, does a wonderful job holding his own against his younger counterparts.  And we get to see badass Yoda do a bit of fighting.  There's a much better storyline than ep. 1, with better foreshadowing of what's to come."
rom-com in a Galaxy far far away
"There is a plethora of things that are wrong with Attack of The Clones.That make it,for me,the worst Star Wars movie of them all.

First off,it doesn´t look like a Star Wars movie.Whereas The Phantom Menace had some shots here and there that were very reminiscent of the original trilogy, in this one we get both a change of environments and settings,and an overload of cgi making up most of these environments and settings.This combination makes the entire movie,with few exceptions,seem like one long video cutscene from some futuristic sci-fi videogame.Were this the only issue of the movie you could see it as just a change in tone and focus for the prequel trilogy and maybe accept it as something different,but still Star Wars,but this is not the case and just adds insult to injury as the movie is not only terrible but it doesn´t fit into the Star Wars vision we all know and love.

A general problem with the movie (and the 3 prequels) is basically that the scripts are terrible,the dialogue is terrible,and the general story,while not bad,is told in such a poor way that it is difficult to salvage anything from the rubble.The poor characters and acting,the settings,the cgi abuse,the unnecesary flamboyance,the overall feel to the story,all these problems stem from bad writing.They were doomed from the start.

Hayden Christensen´s Anakin is the perfect example of this.I´m not saying he´s a good actor,but the guy was crippled from the start.The character is horribly written,with exaggerated outbursts of anger coming from nowhere,with awful dialogue expressing feelings that you never connect or relate to as Ewan McGregor´s solid Obi Wan never does or say anything to Anakin to really justify his rage.Then there´s the unbelievably awkward and forced relationship with Padme.As has been stated before,Anakin is very weird and creepy and stalkish during the whole thing,and his dialogue and acting is cringeworthy as are the scenes that build up this ""romance"".Not even Natalie Portman can save it, reduced to deliver one cheesy line after another.

Character-wise,aside from Obi-Wan,Chancellor Palpatine and Christopher Lee (perhaps the best redeeming factor of the movie) there are not many memorable ones here.Jango Fett is played great by the rough-looking actor,but this brings another problem to the table.Lucas insists on connecting everything from the original trilogy to the prequels,which is as understandable as it is absurd as they are,after all,prequels,set before the originals took place.The entire ""stormtroopers come from clones of Boba Fett´s father"" storyline is just a complex way to bring Boba Fett into the picture,and I don´t mean the actual Boba,but his father,which is basically Boba Fett in different colored armor.It´s ludicrous and comes from either listening too much to fans or just being childish and trying to put every cool aspect of the original trilogy into the prequels (see Death Star references).

Returning to the visual feel of the movie,and to punctuate with a striking aspect for me,I can honestly say that there is 1 (I´m sure there a few more,but I cannot recall) shot in the entire movie that looks like a ""Star Wars"" shot,visually and camera-wise.It is when Padme is in the hollow recipient in the droid factory, about to have molten metal poured inside it and onto her,and the camera zooms in on her face.It is amazing how far this movie goes into new visual territory, departing from the original trilogy and what the Phantom Menace held onto (not that it wasn´t that much).

It is another problem of the film and one central to the prequels;No restraint,no limits,no boundaries.George Lucas has always stated that these movies were Star Wars movies made as he truly envisioned them,products of a time when technology allowed him to fulfill his vision with no barriers.Alas,this has been his and their downfall.Early on in the movie we are treated to an orgy of CGI and special effects that are uncalled for,unnecessary,and instead of inmersing us in the film,detach us from it.For example Obi-Wan crashing out the window and grabbing onto the drone sent to assassinate Padme in her room.What follows is Obi hanging on and flying all across the city´s sky amidst air traffic,with Anakin following him in his vehicle,and actually throwing himself from it to fall onto another one in midair.It is quite flamboyant to say the least,and like the droid factory hijinks (including fight scenes that remind me of Minority Report´s equally unnecessary and flamboyant car assembly fight scenes) they just showcase how CGI has erased the limits once present in the original trilogy (and movies in general back then) that made such wondrous art possible through painstakingly creating,making tangible the stories in our heads,as opposed to shooting actors against a green screen and creating from scratch in a laptop.

I might have to rewatch this to think of other things that are wrong within it,but I think I have sufficiently stated my case as to why I believe Attack of The Clones to be the worst part in the Star Wars saga.Hell,even the music sucks."
"Arguably the worst of the Star Wars saga, Attack of the Clones proves that George Lucas completely misses the point of the prequels and after the pointless and terrible Phantom Menace, this movie focuses on the romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala more than anything else, instead of the friendship of Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi and the corruption and seduction of Anakin like how it was explained in the original Star Wars trilogy. The Clone Wars begin too late because of the pointlessness of The Phantom Menace, and misses the opportunity of improving Anakin and Obi-Wan's friendship so it can matter more in the next movie. The pointlessness of The Phantom Menace also forces the last film to begin at the end of the war which shows that the whole Clone Wars angle is a missed opportunity. It doesn't work as a Star Wars movie because of these.

Despite all this, it also doesn't work as a movie on its own either. The story is basically a horrible love story, and the parts that aren't part of the love story (which is the Clone Wars arc) is quite stupid.

The characters aren't interesting either. Our main character, Anakin, is a whiny, murderous, creepy stalker, and I hate him. His romance with Padmé is written horribly, and it's arguably the worst love story ever put on screen (yes, even worse than Twilight). Most of the other characters are boring stereotypes. The only good characters in this movie are Obi-Wan and Yoda.

Without a good story or characters to be invested in, all the amazing visual effects, thrilling action or another amazing soundtrack don't matter at all, which makes this movie another dull Star Wars movie. Try to avoid the official movie at all costs. Watch a fanedit of this instead."
it's alright but it was a bit dramatic. it could use some more war scenes
"I really don't at all find this better than ""The Phantom Menace"". Even though I had issues with ""The Phantom Menace"" for some big reasons, based on my opinion, I find this one to be the least of the Star Wars series.

The first thing that the movie suffers is how it gives out so many expositions. I don't believe that the film does an excellent job explaining the plot or the situations that's happening in the film, so that was a problem. But that's not my real problem. My real problem is the relationship between Anakin and Padme. I don't think it's sweet nor effective. I just think it's tedious and uninteresting. I don't find Hayden Christensen's performance as wooden as Jake Lloyd's performance in ""The Phantom Menace"", but he is close.

The film does deliver nice special effects and a lot of effort, so I'll give points for that. It's fine that people will say that this is better than ""The Phantom Menace"", but for me, I dislike this one a little more than ""The Phantom Menace"". 4.5/10"
More action. Less whining.
A technically superb bore.
"I have no idea how Lucas managed to make a Star Wars movie boring, but he did. Attack of the Clones is the absolute worst prequel by far, due in large part to the horrendous writing and the mere existence of Hayden Christensen."
"While not as bad as episode i, this film should have a rotten score."
It's quite a decent adventure. I like the steady flow of action and moxy of Obi-One. The romance is not well done and adds to a slightly overlong runtime. It also needed better character development.
Who paid the 66% of critics to write positive reviews about this rubbish?
"easily the worst star wars movie, with its main problem being that anakin just comes off as whiny at times and creepy at others"
only a little less garbage like than Episode I
"I don't see how you can be a Star Wars fan and not like the prequels, maybe excluding Ep 1. In some ways I feel the prequels are more Star Warsy than the originals. It's Lucas's full vision, with all the worlds, a huge diversity in creatures everywhere; this is how the galaxy was back before the original trilogy. 

The whole time I feel for Anakin like ""No! Don't be so angry. Stay positive."" But he is on this downward spin and you can see it coming, and then this is contrasted with his love for Padme. People disparage Hayden Christensen but I think he's pretty good; you can see the turbulence on his face the whole time.

It's the origins of everything. You get to see Boba Fett as a child. You get to see Yoda's skill, and you understand why he's so respected. Anakin is extremely strong and he still gets his arm hacked off at the end-I forgot he lost lost his arm!-which of course harkens back to his son, who would lose his hand years later. There are layers to everything. Yoda is a main character, and dispenses wisdom the whole time. I appreciate the creativity of the world building, and Lucas expressing it fully. These are supposed to be different from the original trilogy because it's just about Anakin. It's about how he becomes the greatest villain. Darth Vader will always just be Anakin to me."
"Easily the worst Star Wars ever made. Laughable dialogue, cringy love angel between Anakin and Padme, Lucas going overkill with CGI, etc. The action sequences are fun, like most Star Wars movies, but that won't excuse how poor this film is."
This movie has a great story and some decent action scenes but some of the dialogue is horrible and it looks like your watching a cartoon at times with all the visual effect.
"Once again, at least an hour of this prequel is tedious and seems unncessary, however it does begin better than the first. It quickly loses that upperhand by introducing useless villains, repetitive action scenes, and so much CGI I thought I was watching a cartoon at once. Anakin is an insufferable lead and it's extremely hard to buy the quick and unrealistic love story that comes from himself and Padme. However, there are some scenes that make it worthwhile, and once again the effects and creatures and insanely cool. This movie benefits from world building and showing us more than the later installments do."
"The story is interesting enough, but the dialogue is noticeably weak in this episode, and to most seems laughable when said aloud. The effects are again impressive though, and we are beginning to piece things together in our way back to the originals. More of the darker stuff is what we need."
"Peg it on the Star Wars Nerdism(?) in me, but I just can't help myself."
"A marginal improvement over the previous disaster in the saga, but Attack of the Clones is still plagued with shockingly awful acting, hollow characters, horribly offensive racial stereotypes and an overwhelming, headache-inducing amount of sub-par visual effects. It benefits from a single plotline that seems to actually have even a smidgen of relevance in the Star Wars saga."

Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones - Movie Review
Never in my born days would I have believed George Lucas could have completely lost the plot like he did making this film. Apart from Ms Portmans sexy curves there is nothing redeeming in this film whatsoever.

The plot, narrative, screenplay and script leave an awful lot to be desired. The scripting of the characters is so empty of any feeling I was sat there in my chair using the force to find it. Sadly it didn`t improve. The digital media the film was made with is far too stale and not near enough technologically advanced to produce a film with. Long shots might looks superb, but sadly they don`t give the viewer the whole picture.

This film is an insult to the star wars genre. The plot is far too overcomplicated with little attempt at explaining the situations within the film in any detail. The editing of the film was obviously done by an overzealous butcher with a hatchet because in certain parts of the film you can see where bits have been snipped without even considering the impact loosing the scene would have on the end product."
