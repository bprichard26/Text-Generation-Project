"Top 5 movie of mine. still hold this just a tad better than Empire. You had to be around when this came out, it was like else. I was a young toddler when this came out and what a shock to the system it was to me. A classic"
"This is one of my favorite movies out there. It's definitely my favorite 1970s movie. This film started this amazing franchise. It's a must watch for everyone. I've seen this movie many times, and it's really awesome."
una obra maestra del séptimo arte
Star Wars begins its influence and pop culture legacy with an epic space opera with groundbreaking visual effects that still hold today and a compeling narrative.
One of most well crafted blockbusters of all time... it builds and builds to a fantastic climax... it progressively gets more interesting
"If I'm going to be honest, this film bored the hell out of me. 80%."
"This sci-fi classic is one of the best movies of all time. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and James Earl Jones did a spectacular job in this movie. George Lucas did a spectacular job as well in directing it. The plot to the movie was very good and the action scenes were awesome. The special effects at the time this movie was made were pretty cool as well. If you haven't seen this movie yet. I strongly suggest that you do. You'll love it."
"It was actually pretty great! I am not much of a Star Wars fan, but it still pretty cool to see how much technologies improved back then for this movie to be this cool."
"The original and a 70s classic, this film is a landmark in any kind of genra"
It's the OG Star Wars movie theres truly nothing to hate about it. This movie is a classic and a masterpiece.
My favorite franchise ever!!!!
"Jedis, Empire, and Rebels oh my! The movie that started it all by George Lucas! A timeless tale of an unknown called to greatness through the hero's journey, but in space! Most of the special effects still stand up to even today! A young Mark Hamill portrayal of a naive boy wanting more Luke Skywalker that captivated the world. James Earl Jones' commanding and menacing voice with David Prowse's physical performance and character design of Darth Vader created one of the best movie villains of all time. Kenny Baker R2-D2 and Anthony Daniels C-3PO as the droids who witness it all and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca the lovable walking rug. Harrison Ford's charismatic and mysterious Han Solo. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa the faux damsel in distress who ends up helping save the own heroes in their own tale! Alec Guiness as the aged and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi help sell and ground the film. Peter Cushing as the sinister Grand Moff Tarkin! John William's legendary score."
Has to be a five star its the original and my second favourite below Empire and just above rise of skywalker.
Star Wars is the most amazing gift to history George Lucas could have given us!
the beginning of a space odyssey that must be seen by anyone who loves good stories
2nd only to Empire Strikes Back
Great start off to the Skywalker Saga. I don't think it is as good as the other films in the Original Trilogy but I still love this movie. A New Hope won 6 deserving Oscars and changed the film industry forever.
"Who could be scare you more as a kid other than Darth Vader, possible the best villain ever made. And also a fan favourite character all over the galaxy, Luke Skywalker. Young Luke living with his Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen is completely unaware of this 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' after seeing a message that his new droid R2-D2 was carrie-ing. See what I did there? No, ok. R2 is desperate to find his old master Obi-Wan, but other droid C-3PO (who had his memory erased after the clone wars) tried to snap R2 out of it and accept Luke as his new master. Luke wonders if Ben Kenobi might know this Obi-Wan but later he is to learn that old crazy Ben was Obi-Wan! Obi-Wan teaches Luke the ways of the forces to go and help him at Alderaan and face Obi-Wan's former apprentice Darth Vader. This film was so enjoyable apart from the graphics, but hey who cares about that?"
Nothing better than this way of storytelling to embark you (audience) on a wonderful new journey to a world far-far-away.
Definitely in the top 10 of all time. The story and technological advances changed movies forever and made the actors major stars.
Iconic movie that everyone over 18 should watch. I say over 18 because I didn't like it that much as a kid but grew to love it. Maybe watch it when you are 10 and again when you are over 18
"An average movie that came out at the perfect time 

Not a big Star Wars fan, but like everyone else I've seen the movies a few times, recently watched this again and man does it not hold up well. All of the sudo British accents and posh attitudes that some of the characters had that were quickly abandoned halfway through the movie. The worst being Carrie Fisher, it was hard to ignore and even harder to give it a pass. The movie had great timing. A few years after the Vietnam War ended and also at the tail end of the Hollywood New Wave that consisted of long artsy serious bleak films that focused on drama and character development. Suddenly here's this action-packed space adventure with robots, space ships, swords, chosen ones, ancient myths wise old men, bad guys in all black, good guys in all white, turn your brain off adventure. Looking back now it's an average movie with a lot of holes in the logic and filmmaking."
Star Wars is a phenomenal cinematic artwork by George Lucas. He is able to portray emotions and feelings well. This movie shows the better future of Sci- Fi movies.
Didnt have jar-jar so its a bad movie. Its pretty good
"Brilliant show! Perhaps the best of the lot, although the original is better without all the silly CGI and background noise added. Alec Guinness, Peter Cushing and Anthony Daniels are absolutely ingenious."
Best movie ever! Saw it as a kid and have watched it many times over the years.
"Increible inicio de esta trilogia, gran presentacion de cada uno de los personajes principales. Buenisima."
"Many believe this to be one of the best movies ever made. For most people Star Wars is life. Trust me I can see how people easily get sucked into this franchise. It will forever be the biggest franchise and will always gain new fans. As a fan who first seen this movie as a kid in the early 90s, I can say it has me hooked for life. I am not a hardcore fan or anything, as I believe there are better films then this franchise. But you can't argue the magic of it. Star Wars could be the first movie franchise that could captivate you when your a child and stick with you throughout your life. A New Hope is still to this day my favorite Star Wars film. Watching our heroes sneak around on the Death Star is still fun to watch to this day."
One of the best films of all time
The basis of a whole genre of filmmaking for a reason.
A new hope is amazing but it can be very slow at times. This one is mainly focused on the story but still has good action scenes. This movie was very good.
An instant classic with incredible effects and great world building. The sets have so much personality and the scenes are iconic.
A great coming of age movie but in space. Sn excellent start to a franchise that will define many generations to come. Amazing!
I love this movie. The only way I could like it more is if I was in the 80's or 70's when the graphics weren't dated but besides that this movie is perfect.
"It will be the force It will be that the force is with me but this film I have already crossed out as my great weakness, this saga is my weakness, a film that is a masterpiece of cinema, which marked a before and after, a saga that has been become on its own merits, the most important in the world, because even 40 years later, remastered films, t-shirts, dolls, imperial helmets, video games and even stuffed animals of this characters, or better than fiction, continue to be released and sold. Science Fiction par excellence begins its journey in an episode IV, which leaves you speechless. The well-worked characters and the direction of 10. May the Force be with you."
"An undeniable classic, a masterpiece of a film"
Still a great movie to watch with friends to this day.
The concept is simple: a fairytale in space. A farmer boy heads out save the princess from the evil knight. And this is why it works.
"THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF CINEMA, MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME"
"This is how you start a franchise; this movie is a masterpiece! John William's score is unforgettable; Darth Vader is an amazing villain; the acting is amazing and all the characters are super fun and well-developed. The action sequences, especially the final battle, is awesome and the visual effects and CGI for the 1970s is incredible and they created the world perfectly. The story as well is amazing combining action, humor and heart and it introduces us to the main concept of the franchise perfectly. This is the best example on how to start a franchise."
"Well, it might have been a good movie in 1977-which I doubt that too. However, watching a 1977 SF movie is as much bored you can get. There are not many dynamic scenes with some sound effect or music. Every action scene is extremely dull."
if you haven't seen the OG's then you must be living under a rock.
A memorably expansive and aged exploration into a sci-fi universe that has fun and genuine performances too.
A must see for all generations!
The greatest blockbuster of all time
"Though there are obviously things that could be better like the lightsaber fights, this is a great movie and very enjoyable. Even if Han doesn’t shoot first anymore, and there is horrendous CGI animals in Tattoine now, I still love this movie."
"Yes, it's old.  Yes, it looks cheap. Yes, Luke whines a lot.

Putting this film in context, it changed everything.  Not just for scifi, but for cinema. It eschewed the 70s demand for realism and grey characters and doubled down onto Joseph Campbell and WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. The story is lifted directly from King Arthur, or Gilgamesh, or King David, or any of a number of preceding tales up to and including a Messiah. 

Setting it in a different galaxy removes all expectation and consideration for culture or historical precedent.  The characters are free to move about and impact more than their village. Humanity, writ large, and with rubber masks."
This is what I call a true sci-fi classic.
"There really is no need to review this movie -- especially at this point. I saw it recently so I thought I should write about it. ""A New Hope' is the gateway into the greatest cinematic universe ever created. From the first scenes of Darth Vader entering Leia's starship with John Williams' 'Imperial March' playing and alarms ringing to our introduction to Han Solo and Chewy in the cantina, this film is a classic for a reason and one you can safely take to a deserted island."
Mark Hamill very good
"Top 5 movie of mine. still hold this just a tad better than Empire. You had to be around when this came out, it was like else. I was a young toddler when this came out and what a shock to the system it was to me. A classic"
"This is one of my favorite movies out there. It's definitely my favorite 1970s movie. This film started this amazing franchise. It's a must watch for everyone. I've seen this movie many times, and it's really awesome."

It's the OG Star Wars movie theres truly nothing to hate about it. This movie is a classic and a masterpiece.
"""A New Hope"" is a fun, easy to follow, carefully edited, charming, and exciting story with all of the Sci-Fi goodies that many Sci-Fi movies lacked before and after it's release. It has its flaws, but it's good enough to start its franchise as we know to be called ""Star Wars."""
"This is an adventure film  with an amazing story.The cast is fantastic.The  maijority of the peaple liki this film.The plot starts with a boy in a planet called Tatoine.The boy found  two droids,one is a robot that speaks every language and the other is R2D2.In this film Skywalker is he boy trainig to become a jedi.This film is very old."
"It was a beautiful film and very interesting, it's actually an action film, because it has an amazing soundtrack, the plot has many details, the story of each characters is very interesting and you`il enjoy the film, was a beatiful film!"
"Probably one of the top five movie of any ever made. Started great franchise, which is now unfortunately dead. If you sit down and watch Episodes 1 through 6, this saga is one of the best ever made. And do not believe someone when they tell you about rumors of other episodes, thankfully those don't count as canon, just ignore those jokers."
My favourite of the Start Wars universe. The Death Star attack is epic and my favourite movie scene when I was a child.
It transcends generations. There's something for everyone to enjoy. The beginning of a legendary series.
"Plenty simple, but when establishing a universe, that's often the key. So often thought of in the context of the empire that the property became that people often forget that there's a solid film underneath it all."
"the one that started it all, this movie changed cinema in way it can't even imagine"
"The Film that started it all.....This is an amazing film, it might even be a cinematic masterpiece."
"Great introduction into the Star Wars universe. Some of the effects are a bit dated but still hold up. Can be a bit slower for audiences used to the more quick speed of modern movies.

George Lucas and his team did an amazing job bringing this movie out to the masses.

4.5/5."
"An absolute masterpiece. This is the definition of the perfect movie, even including slight flaws. Not only is it timeless and a given sense of nostalgia for most fans, but it began the entire ""Star Wars"" franchise and also lead to many more blockbuster movies."
"The movie that kicked off one of the most famous franchises of all time is still a brilliant movie. It introduces us to so many iconic characters and has loads of memorable scenes. The lightsaber duels and the final spaceship scene are so thrilling and always keep you captivated. Han Solo has a nice arc throughout the film and Chewbacca, CP3O and R2D2 are all great additions. It has its issues though, especially when Luke's aunt and uncle are brutally killed by stormtroopers and then its literally forgotten and not mentioned for the rest of the movie."
"This movie is fun, action packed and extremely original. Star Wars can be enjoyed by kids and adult!"
"A classic, timeless film, with an amazing score."
This movie is my favourite movie of all time. We are introduced to characters that we fall in love with instantly and the storyline is very impactful on.
"It was really good in almost all ways possible, except for the visuals. For the time, it's amazing, but it does not make it in this day and age. Amazing story and characters though!"
"Its overrated, and I think if it wasn't so overrated, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. Its not a bad movie, it's good, but it's extremely overrated."
My favorite Star Wars movie and one of my favorites in general.
Absosolutly amazing!
"Just about The most innovative, influential movie in pop culture"
"Suggested Audience: Everyone |
Critical Rating: A |
Nostalgia Factor: Insane |
Viewings: 4+ |
Detail: Star Wars is among the most important films of the 20th century. The film boasts groundbreaking special effects, a mashup world drawing from 1001 influences, iconic characters, and a classic score. Every moviegoer should give this a chance."
"The sixth best SW movie and the first Star wars film in the world! Thanks to George Lucas Star wars, since 1977, become the most excellent science fiction franchise of all time!! Great characters, good story, best musics and the most iconic vilain of all time : Darth Vader ! But the film was surpassed by others SW movies, but thanks of it and the special edition, it become epis.4 : A New Hope; a great hope & give birth of prequels and spin-offs in the franchise. The father of all Star wars universe."
What can I say other than science-fiction would be nowhere what it is today without this movie.
Still looking for flaws. And I still can't find any. Flawless piece of art.
"Where do I begin? STAR WARS (1977) later retitled as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is one of the cultural touchstones of the American Cinematic experience. It has spawned countless spin-off movies, tv shows, books, comic books, radio plays, parodies, video games, toys, and even a Starkid musical. Star Wars is one of the biggest movies of all time, that created one of the most profitable properties ever. I can't imagine George Lucas or any other person on that production even thought, in their wildest dreams that their little movie would turn into the absolute juggernaut of culture it is today. If you are on this website you probably already know the characters, you know the plot, you know the themes. This movie is iconic beyond iconic. The characters are relatable and likable, the world imaginative, the plot simple and approachable. There is tension and humor, and mythos all wrapped in one package. This movie is consistently said to be one of the most culturally important movies of all time, and it deserves it. Of course it has flaws, inconsistencies, clunky dialogue, and weird acting choices. Dated costumes, cheap sets, and some very simple writing. But for a movie from 1977 transporting to our contemporary world, there is no doubt that these flaws fall away. This movie is one of the greatest of all time, and even if you never watch another Star Wars movie, I'd recommend this one. -Rhenn"
")Pros: A New Hope becomes one of the most influential movies in history. The cast is great and Obi-Wan is the best he has ever been in StarWars in this movie. Han Solo and Chewbacca are loveable characters. The plot is simple and that is part of its charm. The formula that they use in this movie works the best in this movie. Darth Vader is a great villain. Luke Skywalker learning how to use the force was fun. When Vader and Obi-Wan meet again after Revenge of the Sith it is a good fight and quite emotional despite the bad choreography. The Death Star scene is great. This movie has gotten better over time and is just a lot of fun.
Overall I really like this movie and I do have nostalgia for it because it is the first Starwars movie I ever saw although there are some flaws.
Cons: I think that the pacing on Tatoinne is a bit slow before we meet Ben. I feel like Leia should have had a bigger reaction to her planet being blown up because millions of people died and it kind of got brushed off. some part of this movie is a bit dated but I am forgiving of that because this film came out in 1977.
This movie is still exceptional though and it is one of my favourite adventure movies.
I'm going to give StarWars Episode 4 A New Hope an (A)"
Amazing movie! It is a classic and I will always love it
It's the wars bro! And it's perfect
"The Director's cut is the best way to enjoy this movie. Even tho' it's 40 years old, it holds up well."
The one that kicked it off...such an amazing score serves as the backdrop to the start of a great saga.
Simply the greatest sci-fi movie if all time
Para mim o quarto melhor filme da saga Star Wars um filme que começa muito bem a trilogia e a saga Star wars
"My favorite film ever. While Empire Strikes Back has a darker and more evolved story, this is my favorite. For a start, the characters are memorable and lovable. I personally love C-3PO and Darth Vader the best. Also, the film takes a simple good vs. evil story and puts it on a galactic scale. There is so much to love in this film, but the setting is the best aspect. The immersive, visually mind-blowing world is incredibly creative with unique people, places, and things. From game-changers like the Death Star and X-Wings to minor details like the Space Checkers game R2-D2 and Chewie play, this world has so many interesting things to watch. I could watch the film without sound and still be more than satisfied. This film is a masterpiece in every respect, so watch this film before you die. It is truly amazing."
"Arguably the most important film in cinematic history – the film that started it all and created a mega pop culture empire. Countless directors and films have been inspired by ‘A New Hope'. 40 years on and it is still as important and relevant as ever. A classic ‘good vs evil' story introducing us to stories, characters, and lore that will last forever. I personally prefer ‘Empire' and ‘Return of the Jedi' over this but nevertheless it's a timeless classic."
This is a movie so perfect that it forever changed the way movies are made and stories are told.
"Its perfect tone, iconic characters, revolutionary effects, and John Williams' magnificent score make Star Wars the timeless classic that it is.  Few films have ever captured the sense of wonder, or the spirit of adventure, quite like it.  This is what has always made Star Wars great.  Not lightsabers."
A beloved sci-fi classic for all the right reasons
"Great movie, important to me, just could do without the special editions, but that isn't my choice. First Star Wars movie I ever saw, too, bak in 2008"
THESE ARE THE BASIS OF THE MOST WONDERFUL SAGAS OF THE HISTORY OF THE CINEMA. And this is the first one
"I think that this movie is overrated. It's not bad, but it's not that cool."
What a great introduction to the best story and franchise ever created.
its good i recommend
"Der wichtigste Film seit es Filme gibt. George Lucas legt hier den Grundstein für eines der größten Franchises der Welt. Durch seinen mythischen Charakter und die legendarische Erzählweise aus langer Vergangenheit dient das Star Wars-Universum wie Tolkiens Herr der Ringe als Vorgeschichte unserer eigenen Zeit. Von seinen Nachfolgern und späteren Versionen hebt der ursprüngliche Film sich vor allem durch Reduktion auf das Wesentliche, ohne putzige oder computergenerierte Kreaturen, Weisheiten aus dem buddhistischen Sprüchekalender oder konstruierte Liebesgeschichten, wohltuend ab."
"Beautiful story, awesome special effects. Star Wars: A New Hope is one of those unforgetable gems."
"Muito bom, fora o começo do filme"
"Greatest movie of the 1970's easily, and sad that it never won best picture (lost to ""Annie Hall"")"
"Aha, the movie that changed everything!"
"Epic, extremely entertaining, an enveloping story, charismatic protagonists and great visual effects. A New Hope is a firm start for this franchise"
"""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""

Pre review:

It's writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.

Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".

Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that deeply trusted in Lucas genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.

The filming of the movie was difficult, full of mishaps, problems with practical effects, a bad first edit of the movie, but that did not stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, the Fox Study began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...

Review:

Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure and excitement. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...

One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.

The story and the characters are original and compelling. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.

The visual composition is authentic and gives the movie a powerful aesthetic value, such as the 'Binary Sunset' scene, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he can see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for the dreamer he really is.

The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.

For sound design, Lucas wanted real noises, not synthesized science-fiction twitters. Thus Star Wars's spacecraft doors open and sandcrawlers rumble with whooshes and clatter from the Philadelphia subway, recorded by soundman Ben Burtt.

Star Wars is far more experimental than believe. Lucas's new methods baffled Fox executives, as he used two and sometimes three or four cameras: encouraging improvisation, he reserved his options for postproduction. He called for naturalistic acting to anchor the space fantasy. He started in close, avoiding establishing shots. He wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" but kept changing key lights for a ""flashing, strobing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.

Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focused on minor characters... The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.

10/10"
"This movie is iconic and so much great things can be said about it, it is iconic and the start to some of the best sci-fi EVER!"
"It was ok, nothing special probably the worst star wars next to phantom menace and last jedi."
A classic that will stand the test of time.
"9/10. It isn't difficult to see why this movie was such a hit, or how it has continued to impact modern cinema. It's incredible in how many ways it is iconic - the opening orchestral hit, scrolling exposition, and slow crawling chase that reveals the sheer scale of the destroyer (and foreshadows the scale of this sweeping universe) only scratch the surface. It has an aesthetic that set the standard for sci-fi fantasy and holds up ridiculously well today, a dozen or so iconic characters (including one of the greatest movie villains in the history of film in Darth Vader), and ground breaking special effects. John Williams turns in an iconic score, and  the action still thrills decades later. The story and writing are a bit pedestrian in comparison, but that hardly matters when everything else about this movie is so awe-inspiring and down-right fun. It's effect doesn't diminish - after dozens of viewings over my lifetime it still inspires joy and wonder."
"Great classic, where it all begun. A New Hope has great story, characters and visual appeal as Hero's Journey."
WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY The RIDE
Incredibly well paced and a lot of fun. A piece of movie history that everyone should experience.
"One of the greatest movies ever, i love it."
a classic and a must see.
This is my favourite of the saga. Really love it.
"Satesfying at it's finest! A great action, sci-fi and comedy movie!
Actually, the first time i watched this i tought that it was the best film i have ever watched! But then i watched the ESB and well lets say that i got shocked! In an awesome way!
10/10!"
"In my opinion the weakest of the Original trilogy, although still a movie worth watching. Just seems rushed at some points."
"For more reasons than the movie itself this is the best sci-fi movie ever made.  The movie was great, but it also caused a paradime shift in sci-fi and movies.  I saw this 8 times in the theater during its original theatrical release.  Back then there were very few cinemas.  The first time I saw Star Wars (2nd week it was out I believe) we waited in line 8 hours to buy tickets, another hour to get in and then the 2 hours to see it.  A month after it was out it still required standing in like 2-3 hours to get tickets.  I think after 2 months it was down to maybe an hour wait.

That caused major changes in cinemas.  In the time between A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back many new cinema screnes were built and opened (because of Star Wars!).  When Empire opened it only took 2 hours or so to get in.

Star Wars also caused massive changes to movie special effects.  Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic continued to be on the cutting edge of special effects for many years.

So given the movie itself plus the changes it caused in cinemas and special effects makes this the best sci-fi movie ever made.  And because I don't expect any future movie will be able to have the kind of impact A New Hope had I don't expect any movie will ever be able to wrest the title of best sci-fi movie ever."
"Great beginning of something even greater. Not one of my favourite Star Wars films, yet essential viewing"
"Good Stuff: The beginning, the middle, the end, and everything in between. A perfect movie.
Bad Stuff: Absolutely nothing"
Great film. The original trilogy still the best.
"Great movie, instant classic, but it would get built on and improved"
Amazing I love this film <3
I have always loved this movie! and watching it this time was no different!
A must see and one of the most legendary movies ever made. A classic
GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
"Cinematic masterpiece. Near perfect story, effects, score and casting. The male and female leads are strong characters. Wish I had a copy of the original theatric release."
When you wake up in the middle of the night and can't sleep and figure you should log some movies to keep track SW REWATCH CAUSE I WAS A KID AND FORCED MYSELF TO STOP OBSESSING AND THIS WAS A NOSTALGIA TRIP AND WHY ARE THERE LIKE NO FEMALES AND I HAD MY ISSUES WITH HOW BASIC AND BLACK AND AND WHITE EVERYTHING IS but I loved cause nostalgia anyways this is not my actual review that's more in my head and in instagram story spams!
"Would be the greatest of all time, but then came along Empire. Second is really good in this case."
"An amazing introduction to the world of Star Wars! Imaginative and with great story telling, A New Hope brings one of the best film sagas to life."
Great exciting movie and watching it after not seeing it for a while really makes you realize how good it actually is and it introduced the franchise that I love today. The only reason that I have it at 4 stars is that to me it's the only one in the original trilogy that didn't age as well as the other 2.
"Amazing movie, don't think i disliked anything in it"
"Iconic. Fantastic. One of the greatest movies of all time. Introduced us to this amazing 
world of sci fi and plants and just.....everything. Introduced some of the most iconic characters of all time. Amazing, amazing, amazing."
I love this movie so much
The movie that started it all
good movie. might still be the best in the series.
"This is a wonderful movie, and it is the bedrock of all the Star Wars films. There is honestly nothing to truly critique. The story and characters are all great, and the action is outstanding."
OMG! It's brilliant. Best thing in cinematic arts. It's great. Star Wars is ♥️♥️♥️
"My best Star Wars Film all the time!!!!

this is the true beginning!!!!"
There is a reason why people even over 40 years later still talks about this movie and that is because it is so good. This movie would spawn the largest film franchise in history and one of the most culturally significant pieces in modern history and after watching the movie it is no reason why. This show from its atmosphere to the story to the acting is superbly made and everyone who has some sort of appreciation should watch this marvel of a film. Watch it.
Great beginning to the space epic!
"My all time favourite movie, not just in Star Wars Saga. I really recommand this! Even special editions are great."
"Action-packed movie, great start to a spectacular movie franchise, great casting, memorable characters, unforgettable movie, highly recommended by me."
Good I like it and great movie to start off the saga
One of the top 100 movies of all time. Enough said.
Grandes actores. Muy buenos efectos para la época. Pero realmente no entiendo porque gusta tanto. Es la única que vi de la saga. No noto demasiada diferencia entre ver Star Wars o los dibujos de He-Man.
"I love it. There is nothing bad to say, it's the greatest Star Wars movie. It's the Star Wars. This made all of Star Wars possible."
"This movie set the bar high for all sci fi, fantasy, westerns to come after it."
First Star Wars.....
the original version the remakes suck. Han shot first!! FU Lucas you sellout
No wonder this saga is so popular. It started off with a great classic movie that will please people of all ages.
*is speechless and crying*
"I went into Episode IV without ever seeing a single Star Wars flick, and I'm more than happy to say it exceeded my expectations. A New Hope is deserving in every single accolade it has gotten. A true, beautiful space fantasy with iconic characters and a fun story."
This movie is perfect.
Anyone who doesn't agree that this is the best starwars film is gay.
"George Lucas's space epic - breakthrough in the field of special effects and work with the setting: stunning scenery, costumes and music of John Williams became the hallmark of the brewing franchise, and paid off the film in 46 (!) times, the fees proved the incredible interest of the audience. After more than forty years, the canvas looks impressive, but when viewed does not leave the feeling that, despite all the technical peaks, memorable characters, staging and scenery... it's a TV movie. I do not know what this is connected with, but no other blockbuster of the past was as stingy on cinematography as this, undoubtedly brilliant, work."
Its awesome and if your a star wars fan no explanation required.
"George Lucas keeps hurting this movie with each remaster but overall it is still iconic and a movie that everyone needs to see. Everything about this movie is I C O N I C: Han Solo, Darth Vader, the Death Star, Princess Leia, EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE."
"A timeless start of to the star wars saga, with groundbreaking visual effects!"
May the Force be with you.
2nd Best Star Wars movie. closely beat out by Empire Strikes Back.
A amazing start to Star Wars
Brilliant - it's easy.
Best star wars film ever!!!!
"Revolutionary and classic, Fantastic characters and plot, changed film forever!"
A great start to Star Wars
Nothing Beats the original!
"Need I say more? This film is an absolute classic. The effects are dated in some areas, but I think considering it was made in 1977 and nothing like it had ever come before, I'd say it looks pretty damn good. I like that they've updated it to keep up with the other films."
Just a beautifuly crafted movie.
"Simultaneously an Auteur's vision and cheesy piece of entertainment for the masses, nothing will ever be like Star Wars again. Not even Star Wars.

A bit rough around the edges, and definitely showing it's age now, this film will still forever be timeless. Like classics before it, the Zeitgeist will forever keep Luke, Leia, Han and Vader alive- even for those who probably haven't even seen this film.  

You aren't a fan of film if you aren't a fan of this movie. It's really that good."
"The movie was excellent and closed out a lot of issues left over from the last jedi. Only criticism I have, this movie at times rushed through scenes to squeeze everything in during the 2.5 hours. I believe if jj Abraham's would have directed last jedi, alot of the issues would have been resolved during last jedi and the last skywalker would have not rushed to close out some critical issues. Excellent movie to close out the saga."
A great movie and a Cinematic Classic.
"For me, the most inspired and captivating film of my childhood and as an adult. George Lucas created pure magic in film form. His characters and worlds far, far away have lived with me practically every day. Genius."
"An absolute masterpiece. The soundtrack, the effects, the characters, the writing, the cinematography, pacing and cut of the film, it is all glorious cinema and makes for a film that stands the test of time and outshines all other Star Wars films as the only film that can possibly exist as a stand-alone film and deliver an amazing experience that will awe audiences young and old."
A classic. The best.
Iconic film. Way ahead of it's time!
El inicio de todo siempre tendrá mucho respeto. Gran película en donde todo empieza
Seen it 100s of times ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The movie that started the blockbuster culture of film making. This movie showed everyone what was possible to accomplish in film making with the right vision.
"How do you come out with a standalone movie, call it 'Star Wars,' and then make it one of the highest-grossing franchises ever? This is how."
A New Hope is the one that started some of the greatest movies in the world a New Hope is one of the best
The movie that changed
"The movie that launched a phenomenon that changed cinema forever. George Lucas crafted what could be described as a ground breaking shift in what cinema could be. A mind blowing spectacle telling a timeless tale of good vs evil.
 
It has its limitations of course but they are easily ignored due to the quick connection to the lead characters. The dynamic leading trio, although not quite yet fully on song, have chemistry by the bucketful.
 
With this movie, Lucas showed the world a galaxy far far away... and we're all still living in its legacy."
"A New Hope is a great film, and cannot be denied as being the film that started the most beloved - at least until The Last Jedi - film franchise in history. 

That being said, its age is starting to show, not in its effects which still look great 43 years later, but in its action and storytelling. The reason why people love The Force Awakens is that it is A New Hope again, but I argue that The Force Awakens is a better version of A New Hope, because Awakens does everything A New Hope does better. 

If the duel between Obi and Vader was more dynamic, or if the attack on the Death Star had more action, this may be the second or third best Star Wars film and not the fifth. 

In all, this film is a must-watch, and I watch it twice a year at least.

My Review: B+"
My 3rd favorite on the list
The start of it all.
Star Wars A New Hope was a great entertainment action fun sci-fi movie. But great for the whole family.
"Star Wars became the backbone for the rise of the New Hollywood Era. It all started as an idea from George Lucas in which now is considered one of the best movie ever made. The screenplay is amazing, the performances from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are awesome, and the creativity of the aliens and battle scenes contains realism. Even the music score from John Williams touches each scene from a sadden climax to a happy ending. In the end, Star Wars had taken the film industry into new heights."
"This film is SO ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. All the visuals look fantastic, the action is always phenomenal, and the classical good and evil story make for what seems like a perfect movie!"
"Though star wars a new hope is fun, it just didn't hit the landmark for me and could've been better then it was."
an original but the lightsaber moments don't live up to expectations
"Great start to a franchise, can't imagine seeing 77 but i saw it in 2000's."
"The movie that kick started off a franchise and it was a movie that not just changed blockbuster films, but films in general... the story of a simple farm boy who gets whisked away to save a princess along with a smuggler, 2 Droids and a old man who has powers and who got wisdom. To destroy a space station. That simple premise of a story from George Lucas changed the way of films. This film for me went a quick pace, there isn't anything that slowed down for time. The story isn't the best in the Star Wars franchise and the effects are not good to some people and people will definitely have big issues with the special edition changes that Lucas made, that doesn't really bother me in this film particular. The lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader isn't the greatest, but it's still good to watch. The acting is abit questionable from the main actors but they didn't know how big it would be...    But this is and always will be a classic film, one of my favourite films ever, its just a fantastic film."
Great movie with great effects but a few campy moments that don't detract too much.
Good story and for that time good SFX
It amazes me that this was made in 1977.
A classic must watch for everyone!
"You have to love this movie for what it is, and for the time and the budget what was done here was extraordinary.
The acting was mediocre but this was the first of it's kind and modern movies still fail to rival it."
"An absolute classic, effects still hold up today and all of the characters are interesting, likable, and the story has absolutely no fat in it."
"The first installment introduces the main characters with really good story telling and amazing action. This movie gives room for Luke to grow smarter physically and mentally while he faces his problems. The film is showing some age but it feels more authentic than a CGI overload. Although this movie is considered a cinematic masterpiece, I do find little flaws in it. The movie has a dragging feeling in the beginning and the end seems predictable."
The greatest movie ever made.
"Perfect movie if you watch the GOUT. If you don't, you will still have a fun time but with dated effects and unnecessary changes, other that that the special edition is still a solid flick."
"One of the best and most influental films ever made, this movie has had a massive impact on filmmaking and has inspired so many people, truly one if the most entertaining films of all time with the genius world building, characters, story, music the list goes on and on. A+ or 10/10!"
Exquisitely powerful and beatiful visuals and original vibes of spontaneity are so much more than enough to overpower a slightly dull storyline.
Arguably one of the greatest movies ever made ever
(1977 Original Theatrical Release) Rating: 10/10
"A New Hope introduces a new beginning and a new hero, Luke Skywalker!"
"Amazing and Astonishing are the best words to describe Star Wars - A New Hope. It's the movie that started the biggest Franchise. The characters, the visuals and score is just great.
The talented actors are bringing this si-fi flick to the heights in Galaxy Far Away…"
It's the Star Wars classic known to be the one that started them all.
Perhaps the best sci-fi film ever made.
"A fantastic step for George Lucus in the Sci-Fi genre! Some special effects aren't that great anymore unfortunetly, but that obviously doesn't make this a low tier film."
"This movie doesn't even need reviewing.  A charming, fun, rightly classic sci-fi fantasy adventure a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  It forever revolutionised cinema - and not surprisingly, either."
Who is reading reviews of Star Wars. Seriously?
One of the best movies I've ever seen!
A must watch movie that has significantly impacted our culture. A classic tale of adventure told in a far away world.
Probably my favorite film of all time.
How could anyone not love this movie which started the favorite franchise?
"Having grown up with this film my opinion is most likely a bit biased. This film is spectacular achievement in what a space adventure can be. It paves the way for so much story telling in a universe with unlimited potential. George Lucas was smart to write a story with common archetypes that people can identify with, but gave the universe and immense level of depth that he could play with. This film began to break the box and allowed us into his imagination. Incredible achievements in effects and cinematography."
"Simply the greatest science fiction film of all time and one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. This film has brought fascination to a film genre, that of science fiction, which was losing public interest. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope it was the highest grossing film in the history of cinema for 16 years and has completely changed the film industry with visual and sound effects never seen before. This film is a cult and won 7 Oscars and frankly also deserved the one for the best picture."
"Brilliant in every way with amazing original story, amazing and different characters, while also setting up a universe that is so unique it is a wonder to explore throughout the film."
"One of the greatest movies of all time. Not only did it spark one of the most successful franchises ever, it can stand alone as a great journey even without the incredible sequels."
Do I really need to explain why?
"I'm 20 years old so although I appreciate this movie, I still can't help but feel that time has had an effect on my enjoyment of the original star wars trilogy. Still enjoyed it"
"It's so cool for a 1970s movie but now i found the last scene so boring, but its an awesome movie by the way"
"It is the ultimate heroes journey, and that can be said about the whole original trilogy."
Star Wars: A New Hope is amazing! One of the best movies ever made.
"What is there to say. A sci-fi classic. Great characters, great story, great cast. Obviously 5-stars!"
"Ambitious, creative, and magnificent. Star Wars: A New Hope is definitely the tie that will bind"
"This movie is an absolute classic! definite must see, amazing movie"
"The Star Wars movie that started it all. It's just awesome, man."
"Perfect, the start of the best franchise (minus the new Disney ones) ever put to the big screen. Loved every second of it. Just simply perfect."
"A legendarily expansive and ambitious start to the sci-fi saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to the possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same."
"The first Star Wars film is a masterpiece, from the amazing characters to the timeless practical effects. It's a space twist on the classic hero's journey story that also does a great job of setting up a sequel, 10/10."
The start of my teenage years.
So amazing a well deserved 5 out of 5 beginning to this franchise.
A classic film enough said
Amazing movie. A must see if you haven't already watched it.
"Like Harry Potter, Lotr, Jurassic park, etc.. Beautifull stories.."
An absolute classic! Well acted and the actors were well cast for the roles. You really felt the presence of both good and evil in this film. The breathing and voice of Darth Vader really make his presence strong on screen. I absolutely love this film and never grow tired of watching it. A must watch!
"absolutely phenomenal, redefined how films are made, and paired with a kickass soundtrack. shame that they added too much CGI in the 1997 version but amazing film nonetheless"
The OG . Still excellent cinema .
Legendary classic.  Great acting and incredible cast and crew.
"If you're a movie watcher. It is Imperative to see this film. It changed everything about the Film industry as well as being a fantastic story, With brilliant and memorable characters. Plus a Brilliant score."
"Simple yet simply perfect. When explaining why something simple works, one can either take the short route, or the really, really, really long route. I'm gonna take first one here as I assume almost everyone has seen this film or at least has an opinion. While virtually every aspect of filmmaking is working in full force with great care being put into transferring the tropes and visual appeal of early space adventures into the directing style and story elements of Kurosawa's samurai films, the most important thing here is the pacing and how well put together everything is, the rate at which new information is revealed, the ratio of action scenes to quiet moments, the time that we spend at every location or setpiece, and the fact that it changes the regular formula of adventure stories of ""go there do this"" to the basic but often forgotten ""WANT this, CAN'T do that"""
A classic film essential for all ages to enjoy.
A piece of cinema to treasure forever
"A wonderful start to an epic journey. A truly remarkable film

A"
All around a very good movie. It's hard to believe it has anything to do with the politically driven nightmares of Disney.
"Easily the best space opera of all time. George Lucas original Star Wars film takes us down the rabbit hole of Joseph Campbell's ""Heroes Journey"" lets us explore the most interesting universe of all time."
Still a great movie.
"When considering the fact that Star Wars is such a cultural force I found it odd that I had never actually seen the film that kicked off this movement but recently I was able to remedy the situation and actually watch this movie in full. Science fiction films aren't usually my thing although I can understand why 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Solaris (1972) and Blade Runner (1982) are called masterpieces. I wouldn't put this film in the same echelon as those excellent films but it still entertains 42 years after it's release and the appeal of the comedy and intergalactic action sequences to young men is understandable. I never completely fell in love with it but the special effects still dazzle and some exhilaration can still be extracted from the battles between good and evil. Still an absolutely essential film to watch due to the influence it has had over popular filmmaking in the last 4 decades and what a large following it continues to have.

Young Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, who has grown up on Tatooine becomes a freedom fighter when he witnesses a hologram of Princess Leia, Carrie Fisher, who leads the Imperial Senate asking for aid in defeating the Galactic Empire and their fearsome leader Darth Vader. He is mentored by Obi-Wan Kenobi, Alec Guinness, who educates about the ""Force"" and what would be needed to become a Jedi Knight. He teams up with Han Solo, Harrison Ford, who transports him to the Death Star where Leia has been imprisoned by Vader. The Millennium Falcon, Solo's spaceship, is captured in the Death Star's tractor beam and the men have to struggle to get the Princess back and avoid being caught and murdered by the Storm troopers who are under the command of Vader. Eventually the three come together and are able to destroy the Death Star.

The loveliest sections of the film come when the young Skywalker is taught about the ways of a proper Jedi by the elderly and wistful Kenobi. Of course Guinness' portrayal of his character is masterful even as we now know that he had contempt for this film and the part he had to play in it. He never strains too hard to appear sagacious and intelligent even as George Lucas' none too subtle screenplay does him no favors but instead chooses to play his role in the style of Laurence Olivier in Sleuth (1972) as he is very matter of fact about his erudition. Hamill shows some signs of being an inexperienced actor but at the end of the day it is difficult to imagine any other actor embodying Skywalker better than he does and his freshness and lack of experience lend to our comprehension of the character. Lucas does what so many of the imitators aren't able to do as despite how obvious and clunky some of the screenplay is the surrogate father figure undertones work and the ""Force"" is described clearly and in a way that will entice young children to want to witness it being used. We do feel anticipation after hearing about this difficult to learn ability and we are able to care about the generic young man we are presented with because the bonds he forms seem very similar to those that we experience. 

Unfortunately the film did have issues as Fisher's acting is atrocious and some of the action scenes can become repetitive but it is easy to forgive these flaws when we can appreciate the stunning visuals and the hokey charm of the comedic back and forth between the droids. While I would have liked to have seen an actress who can actually act play the only major female role in the film I will admit that Fisher gets very little to work with and it would be sad to see Judy Davis or Amy Irving wasted on such a nothing part. The action scenes also may have been brilliant at the time and for people who are more fascinated with that sort of carry on it may satisfy their needs. I actually look forward to seeing the sequel to this film as I am aware of the fact that it is considered a significant improvement over this one and if it contains more of the same excitement I will be thrilled."
"Overall amazing film from the action to the soundtrack, the now classic film that started the whole saga."
It's the original and it's awesome it's not the best but all these are well done. And it introduces everyone WOW
"Of course, this is considered the 4th Episode/Movie of the Saga since the Prequels (Episodes I, II, and III) weren't made until 1999... It was my first Star Wars movie and it was so good."
Star Wars Episode IV changed my life.  This is the most influential movie I've ever seen in my life.
"A little boring, but it is a classic one!"
"What can I say about this film that hasn't been said already. It is a cinematic masterpiece and a very compelling and well written story from a director who, back in the day, was brand new, 
and unknown, but he had created something original that has never been seen before on the big screen. Today, it is a pop culture phenomena and practically everybody has heard about it, but why is it so good, I'll give my own opinion and explain what I love about this movie. This movie just throws you right into the universe that it takes place in, and you know nothing about it. They lay the whole world before you and it gives you little bits and pieces along the adventure. C-3PO and R2-D2 are hilarious and make quite the comedic duo that keeps you laughing and also curious about the world around them. Mark Hamill was really good and sold that he was someone who wanted more out of his life than farming, his character has many layers to him, and he is easily relatable to a ton of real people. Harrison Ford is as charismatic and likable as ever and brings some lovable smuggler wits along with him. Carrie Fisher to me wasn't quite as good as she could have been, but she improves from each movie. I think that they should've explained who Bail Organa is and where princess Leia comes from because the destruction of Alderaan is emotionless and carries no weight to the story because literally all we know is that it is Leia's home world. Alec Guinness is awesome in this movie and really brings the veteran presence with experience perfectly, and his death was both emotional and motivational to the character of Luke Skywalker. The practical effects were amazing, and the score for this movie composed by John Williams is flawless, timeless, and can never be replaced, remixed, remade, it is easily the best part of the movie; except for Vader who is such an interesting and menacing villain who makes you instantly fear the Empire, but he also has an excellent element of mystery about him that makes you want to know who he his and about his past, but Lucas leaves him completely ambiguous until the prequels ( And we all know how that turned out ). All in all this is a beautiful work of art and must be watched by everybody who ever watches movies ever."
The first film that created a Mythical Saga
"Any criticism of this film I've seen seems to revolve around the dialogue and acting. These are absolutely fine reasons to dislike a movie - we all have our own opinions on what makes a great movie.

For me though, rarely, if ever, does a movie perfectly replicate how humans talk to each and behave around each other. It's kind of impossible to expect perfect acting and perfect dialogue.

So sometimes a movie need to be judged on what it does well, rather than what it doesn't. Star Wars does almost everything else perfectly. It's a brilliant story, brilliantly shot and has captured the imaginations of and inspired millions, and continues to do so.

I think this is more than enough to receive a positive review."
This is the first that launched the greatest trilogy known to mankind. You fall in love with every one of our protagonists and the villain of Darth Vader is the most iconic in the history of movies.
"The start to an epic film series loved by many and it was a great start to the long story. This film was a simple film with a simple idea and now it is one of the most profitable names ever. The story to this is still great that the boy on Tatoween becomes a Jedi master who fight Darth Vader is still famous and classic today. This film introduces some of the most fun and original characters in film from the young Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to the evil Sith Lord Darth Vader these characters opened film makers eyes to make new bold characters. This film changed film making forever in a few ways firstly, it opened up eyes to the sci-fi genre secondly, it made new characters from good to evil finally the completely original story that has sparked so much interest even 42 years later. Overall this is one of the most monumental films of all from the story to the characters it really was a New Hope to cinema."
"Enjoyable, now matter how many times you've seen it. The classic dialogue, the banter and rapport between the characters. The space battles, the laser shootouts, the high stakes, its no wonder that over 40 years later, it is still worth watching."
"The first in the Star Wars saga and far from the best, but still very enjoyable and the effects actually don't look that bad compared to today. Of course, we have to give credit to introducing us to Dart Vader, now the ultimate bad guy of the age. Of course, Harrison Ford is brilliant, and R2 - D2  and C - 3PO  are great fun. It's very far from being the best of the batch (but then, it's sequel was the Empire Strikes Back.) but is still a great watch and is a far better opening than The Phantom Menace."
"Boring Movie. I never bought that Solo return to help Luke nor Vader as villian of somekind. Then it was passable, but today is far beneath Prequel trilogy which actually buildt universe and created interesting conflict.
Without PT this movie falls flat"
"The original Star Wars is a classic and a must-watch for all, combined with Lucas's direction and script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Taylor's cinematography, the editing by Hirsch, Chew and Lucas, Barry's production design, Christian's set decoration, Mollo's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Star Wars represents a leap forward in how movies are made!!!"
"A truly amazing film with revolutionary graphics, wonderful characters and an iconic score, what's not to love? 9.5/10."
This movie is my childhood and also one of the best movies I have watched
"Cheap and unbelievable.  Actors, early in their career, do not have the gravitas to pull this really cheesy looking vehicle into relevance.  This was a kids' movie and continues to be.  It is already several decades behind other science fiction works.  Why this worked can be laid to the feet of kids."
StarWars made my childhood of new hope born with prequels the  New hope with the books EU love new hope to me
"What a fantastic first entree to the Star Wars franchise! This was the film that gave us iconic characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Chewbacca. There are so many iconic and memorable moments in this film including the binary sunset scene, the cantina scene, and the incredible Battle of Yavin scene. With groundbreaking special effects that still hold up pretty well today, an amazing John Williams score, and a great story, A New Hope is a truly amazing, near-perfect movie. A+ 98/100"
Quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.
"The perfect start for a saga that has gained fans around the world for 40 years. 
A movie that started a change in cinematic industry and became a pop-culture phenomenon due to its charismatic characters, its exciting and unforgettable battles or lightsaber duels, and its great background story: a story of love, hate, friendship, loyalty, power and fear, but at the end... family."
the best Star Wars film ever made !!!!!!
"The movie that started it all. It is a fun, action packed juggernaught of a film."
It's an amazing movie with a great story and some incredible actors
The classic Star Wars. Stay on target!!!
"This film was a great film and a start to something spectacular! A new hope was the first of its kind and a great film for its time! The nostalgia in this film is unreal and Luke Skywalker was a character anyone can relate to. The three main characters Luke, Han, and Leia were all spectacularly written."
"So how can a person review one of the best movies ever made, pretty much like this. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE! While it's not my favorite of the Star Wars films, there is no denying the iconic characters, music, scenes, and moments this film has brought. We wouldn't have half of the films we've got today without this gem. If you've never seen it, all I can say is give it a watch and transport yourself to the titular galaxy far far away."
"This is a great movie, still holds up 40 years latter"
"The beginning of the greatest Scifi saga of all times. Thank you George Lucas for your universe, your stories and your characters, may the Force always be with them !"
"Maybe there is no perfect movie but I feel this comes close.  The hero is good the baddie is bad, one doesn't have to muddle the story to have a good movie."
An unforgettable vision from Lucas himself!
"Star wars is a movie that benefits from a great cast, great story, great characters, great score and great acting giving us alot of iconic scenes such as the Obi wan sacrifice, the cantina scene, the Vader choking scene and the final showdown and ceremony star wars is a movie definitely worth your time 9/10"
"The worthy beginning of one of the greatest sagas ever written, ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" takes science fiction to a whole new level by setting a precedent in the genre of space opera. An absolute must see for any cinephiles wishing to see the beginning of an epic space adventure."
"A cinema changing masterpiece, this stereotypical fairy tale on space immerses viewers on a rich story of heroism."
Amazing movie I love every movie in this trilogy.
A new Hope is really good. This is very well written it has a good story. Now Darth Vader is a good villain but the characters I hate are Luke Skywalker's Uncle and Aunt suck. The only thing I don't like is Princess Lelia she just come out of no where at the beginning of the film she's important but we don't really know her maybe introduce Princess Lelia more in the next film?
All time best movie ever! Great story about good vs. evil.
"The saga begins... This hero's journey is not entirely unique; however, its setting in a rough galaxy with immovable empires, tense dogfights, and plenty of scum and villainy truly take you to a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away."
Saying this is the greatest science fiction action movie of all times is an understatement. This movie framed the entire serious science fiction genre.
This movie will always hold a special place in my heart. It is the first Star Wars film I ever saw. It changed the way movies were made. George Lucas is a genius.
One of the greatest films ever made. Legendary. Never gets old.
"After a long time I saw this movie again, and I really remembered very little of it except the important details.
Not to believe that it was in 1977, this film would not shame many movies that came much later, in terms of effects.
All the ""stars"", ""robots"", ""soldiers"", ""aliens"" and more, it's just a huge investment. In general, the whole idea is ingenious. I imagine, what people thought about this film at the time, in terms of effects.
As for the characters in the film: R2-D2 and C-3PO, they add a lot to the film, especially humor.
Han Solo (Harrison Ford), was excellent, he also added a lot of humor to the film, and in general he played the best in the film.
Darth Vader, is one of the biggest and most famous characters in the history of cinema.
All the other characters are excellent too, what an investment.

In summary: This is an excellent film, and one of the best SF films that we have had, the films that follow it (5,6), even better."
It's perfect in just about every way.  There's your review!
A must see movie for every generation.
Fantastic ageless classic!
"Fell asleep twice. Bad movie. Maybe good for that time, but today its obsolete"
Besides some excusable bad acting at times by a really young cast this movie is perfect.
"I would rate this movie higher, but already got too much hollow praise and have way too much plot holes and boring moments"
this is the standard for fantasy entertainment. Everyone has seen it or should see it. It changed movies forever and has always been my favorite!!!
"After all these years you can still go back and watch where it all began. Way ahead of its time it still makes us want become a Jedi knight, hold a lightsaber in our hands while we hear all about the the rise and fall of these once great Jedi warriors. A simple but engaging plot that lunch our expectations and excitement to a galaxy far far away."
"A good movie that ultimately, drew millions of people together as fans of the Skywalker saga."
star wars is a masterpiss
I was 9 in 1977 and this movie blew my mind!
"This is now around the 19th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope and I can gladly say that it was just as good as I remembered.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is the 1st Star Wars film ever to be made and the 4th Star Wars film in the Skywalker story line. The film was directed by George Lucas who would later go on to direct Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. The film stars Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The acting may not be the best, but it's at least 10,000 times better then Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Some of the actors were fine like Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, but there were also some actors who I thought did a very good job like Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Peter Cushing as Wilhuff Tarkin.

The characters in my opinion are some of the most iconic and memorable characters from cinematic history. I Personally think that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are two of the most perfect depictions of good and evil from fictions history.

The cinematography was very strong with some great and iconic shots of the scenery and characters.

The settings for the time in my opinion are really strong and memorable from Tatooine to the Death Star.

The set designs and props were done really well from the building designs to the various weapons.

The costume designs and makeup is also really strong especially with the Stormtroopers and Darth Vader.

In my opinion the practical effects are amazing from the various puppets to the various space ships.

The film also has some really memorable and well done action scenes from the blaster fights to the space battles.

The film also has some extremely quotable dialogue from the very start to the very end of the film.

Personally I think that the music is some of the greatest ever put or ever will be put to film.

The story I personally love from the message to the various plot points here and there. 

The film also had some good comedy especially with the characters R2-D2 and C-3PO.

The film at points also had a really strong atmosphere especially around the character Darth Vader. 

The film is also extremely enjoyable and something that I could watch everyday for the rest of my life. 

Over all I give it a 
9/10
99%
4.95/5

One of the greats"
"While most of the effects REALLY don't hold up, as well as most of the acting, A New Hope is still a really enjoyable film that revolutionized film as a whole."
"One of the greatest starts to a franchise ever, a must see for not only science fiction fans, but movie fans in general."
"A classic, the movie that every blockbuster want to be and almost in every case not are even close to this."
"Star Wars is near perfect with incredible acting, story, action, and has a perfect score. Star Wars is one of the greatest movies of all time and it does deserve it. There is so much to love about this film. It can make you really get to your emotions through the story, the music, acting, and visuals, but can also make your blood pulse with thrilling action scenes."
"The overall best ""Film"" in the Star Wars franchise. It started so many cliches and added so much to the Sci-Fi mythos and to filmmaking in general. If it's watched in the mindset of the '70s, it's a perfect film and it can be considered the most legendary film of its time. In today's mindset, its near-perfect but some alterations change it for the worse and it does have some flaws."
"The beginning of a saga. The start of a legend. Originally titled “Star Wars”, Episode IV is works both as a standalone tale of good vs. evil, and as a chapter in the saga’s ever expanding narrative."
All time classic! Very original movie back in time!!
"Excellent movie. Wish they wouldn't keep ""upgrading"" it, though"
Excellent movie. This started it all and is better than 99% of the movies made today.
No movie would deserve the 100% more than this one. Just perfect!
The start of a beloved genre that will makes us want to go to a galaxy far far away.
"What an incredible film. George Lucas had a vision to create the best space, sci-fi, fantasy, epic ever and he delivered. The visuals of this film were so complicated, he had to create an entire visual effects company to handle it. From the opening shot of the Star Destroyer chasing Leah's Lucas established how groundbreaking his visuals are. That shot still holds up today. Most of the film does with it's incredible miniatures.

It isn't just a visual spectacle; the story, characters, and world building are amazing. Although the script is a little shaky as Lucas didn't know how far and successful the franchise would be. Luke, Han, and Leah are the perfect trio of characters. The stary eyed child, the smuggler, and the princess all juxtapose each other and lead to great dialogue and character development. Darth Vader and General Tarkin are two great oppressors. They're the embodiment of tyranny, evil, control by force, and brain washing."
"Short story, shows what it wants, good movie."
"Fun film, but not as great as everyone says it was.  Probably was loved as much as it was because there wasn't much anything like it at the time.  This isn't true anymore.  Although, the studios are getting away from this with less male action/adventure movies."
"One of my all time favourites. Timeless and amazing space opera that follows me always since childhood. I watch it at least once per year. It has it flaws, yes, and it's not the best one of all the original trilogy, but for sure it's among the best 3. Great movie from a galaxy, far, far away."
Second highest grossing movie of all time. A historic event the like of which we won't see again. Watched it at the drive in theater as a kid and was captivated.
was the first scifi movie i saw when a kid and loved it and all that followed expect for 7 8 and it looks like 9 going to sux as well
incredible and perfect movie
"(Review for the 1977 Theatrical Release) - The way that this movie makes audiences feel with it's special effects, actors, and uniqueness is incredible. This movie presents itself as only the beginning for a larger story but still satisfy's the audience with it's personality and exciting moments to make it stand alone as nothing short of amazing. I have never before been so amazed by a film. While it does suffer a bit from odd editing, it doesn't have the self indulgent CGI that the 2004 version has. Everyone should try to watch this movie the way it is supposed to be watched."
"Everything about this movie was awesome and no im not fanboying here im giving it my critical opinion on it. The movie had a low budget and it still mange to be a good movie. The acting, the action and adventure felt great but i think the best thing was the score it was one the best i heard this movie was powerful back in 1977 it did great in the box office and can just talk hours about this movie"
The movie that started it all. This movie revolutionized the cinema. This movie introduced us to awesome storytelling and awesome characters. This movie has a special place in my heart. Not my favorite Star Wars movie but I have a lot of nostalgia for this film. Grade: A+
"Sceneggiatura e recitazione discrete. Buona la scenografia. Colonna sonora di J. Williams perfetta. Nel complesso film carino. Voto:7,5"
Best First Movie Of The Trilogy
"Truly one of the greatest films in modern cinema - it shaped my childhood, and created a life-long love of the sci-fi and fantasy genres. Every kid should see this!"
A true classic in the scifi genre.
I am old enough to have seen this in the movie theater as a kid. Honestly changed my life and I am proud to have introduced my kids to it as well.
A landmark achievement of modern culture. Comparable to Greek mythology in terms of importance.
"wow the original strong film, with strong charactors, good verses evil, a strong princess who does just as much to rescue herself as those who are trying to rescue her are capable of. A fim I watched that many times I can't count, a film that was staple viewing at Christmas for a many numer of years and I could sit down tomorrow watch it again and enjoy it as much as I did the first time"
Review applies to the non special edition version
"When this film debuted it was absolutely groundbreaking. while there have been several revisions and versions released, this is still the original, the one that kicked it off, the model, the one that set the tone of imitating Japanese Samurai films.. and any SW film that DOES NOT to that... ISN'T a Star Wars film."
"Exciting, fun, well-made. Star Wars: A New Hope is the perfect movie to watch at any time. It's humor done right. It's action done right. Honestly, it's film done right!"
"OBVIOUSLY one of the greatest blockbusters of all time, STAR WARS from 1977 is still to this day, 42 years later, an extremely fresh and exciting film with originality written all over it. I continue to watch this film (the original cut) with the sheer sense that I am watching it for the very first time, and it hits all the right places EVERY SINGLE TIME. Without a doubt, one of the most quotable and timeless films. It reminds us film lovers that you can do SO MUCH with simplicity, and STAR WARS  does just that. A true masterpiece of the science fiction genre, an essential in one's movie collection, and a staple in pure film history."
"A movie proyect that change the rules about special effects, so inspirational and a fundation in the modern movies"
5 Stars for the original trilogy (not the CGI puked all over Special Edition).  Han shot first!! =)
The Original Star Wars is a great sci-fi Film. Even though it is really dated.
"The one that started it all, and still my favourite Star Wars film."
"The birth of a galaxy far, far away is solidified as one of the most influential and entertaining films in history. Between the fascinating story, richly written characters and score from John Williams, we are treated to something truly special. This was the perfect launching point for the greatest franchise in cinematic history."
"A suprise to be suer, but a welcome one"
What needs to be said the ultimate classic Sci-fi movie.
"The movie that changed history. This franchise is gold, not counting the Last Jedi. It is the movie that started it all"
What is there left to say about Star Wars?
"I understand that this movie is revered quite heavily. But, from a film lovers point of you, it is probably the worst of the original films. It plays like a bad episode of a low budget sci-fi TV show from the 70s.  Not to mention that it completely lacks any depth or substance, and often feels like a giant toy commercial. I wanted to love it, but it kind of just falls flat. I donï¿ 1/2(TM)t take it for granted, I know it established Star Wars as a pop culture phenomenon. But, I am not going to jump on the bandwagon just because itï¿ 1/2(TM)s cool to say that itï¿ 1/2(TM)s a good movie.  I think itï¿ 1/2(TM)s important to be objective. And from that stance, if you were to hold some of the greatest films ever made next to each other and rank them, I feel like it would rank pretty low."
The best movie of all time.
"A film classic, and one of the essentials in its history. The original Star Wars has some script problems, but none of it distracts from how important this landmark truly is."
"- Epic lore
- A hero who would both flaws and a rising potential 
- Great build up that was followed through 
- A strong female character that was focused on their galaxy's politics"
What can be said that hasnï¿ 1/2(TM)t already been? Simply a towering achievement in adventure cinema.
‘Stars Wars is one of those Blockbuster classic with well written iconic lines you never seem to forget .
Still as excelent as it ever was.
"Great start to of the greatest movie franchise of all time. Just loads of fun but has some depth with an underlying universal message about the force within us and the force that binds all living things. They struck gold with the casting of Harrison Ford, Alec Guiness and James Earl Jones - this franchise may never have become what it has were it not for those three performances which transcended the genre and made it something more."
The cinematic masterpiece of the 70s. That's it. That's my review.
A great start to the saga.
Amazing movie that introduced us to this wonderful world of Star Wars.  A classic that will live for generations.
The film that created Science Fiction and still is one of the best to date. Classic !
"A classic sci-fi ""popcorn"" movie that's mostly about advanced,  flawless concept art and design and simple, escapist good vs evil motives. Powerful soundtrack and dynamic cast helped impress audiences also. Much loved film became, for better or worse, a sales franchise that demands further iterations whether the story elements are worthwhile or are frustratingly bad! I would of course give the movie ***** as a rating, but unfortunately in 1997 George Lucas inserted a scene where Harrison Ford talks to a computer animation of Jabba the Hutt in a landing hanger, and the gangster looks like a giant TV-quality animation made of turd. If you own a video file editor (Premiere Pro etc) you can actually make a version of the film with it removed, up to you."
"My childhood was built on this masterpiece, so how could it not be a perfect film to me?"
Nearly cinematic perfection.
"One should never wonder why this saga became - putting it mildly - a phenomenon. Originally called simply ""Star Wars"" is a beautiful mix of fairy tale, western tale and above all - an epic tale about good versus evil. A combination that in theory sounds silly and bizarre (which is partially true), was done seamlessly and what's more important - imposingly, taking under consideration the history of production from the very beginning. With addition of fun cast, now legendary soundtrack, groundbreaking visual effects and non-stop action, one of the greatest movies of all time is right in front of you.

There were more complicated plots in the history of Cinema, therefore the movie is not demanding. Two fractions fighting each other - each has their leaders, but one of them has constructed a weapon so powerful, that is immediately on the winning point and therefore, it becomes a space menace. Nevertheless, every menace has its weak points - and this is the key plot device, the plans of ultimate weapons that hopefully will reveal its weak point, allowing for immediate attack and destruction. Our MacGuffin lands on rather boring planet - right in the hands of or young protagonist who yearns of adventure. Now, having precious plans in his possession, he has a perfect opportunity to start his journey. But this is only top of an iceberg."
"Calling this movie awesome would be an understatement. Calling it a legend in the history of cinema would be more or less precise. This film not only introduced the world to a sci-fi franchise, but to a whole new phenomenon: STAR WARS."
The best movie of my childhood I absolutely love Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa.
"What has not been said about this movie? Rather than tell you views on acting and visuals that defined a generation and changed the industry let me just describe one visual. A boy sits in a green pinto at the Sundance Kid Drive in within Oregon, Ohio. He's watching this movie eating a cookie. He is so amazed that he stops chewing and sits wide eyed for over an hour just staring at the screen in amazement. 40 years later he still does the same thing, yet makes sure to close his mouth while watching it. Star Wars, among 3 other films defined my love of cinema. I'm sure it did the same for you if you were around during that time. It most likely could have done the same for many generations after. What more is there to say?"
"Awesome film, best film ever made."
a life changing movie
"It's not perfect, but is groundbreaking and deserves it's great reputation. This is my favorite of the saga, and possibly of all time."
"I Grew up watching the original triology. A classic that everyone should see. It's funny,  creative, and ground breaking for it's time.
 A film that is timeless."
"This was an overall good movie, it had a start, middle and end for the reason being George Lucas did not know if the movie would be a hit, and I think he did a great job with the Sci-Fi action movie."
Its like whisky destilled in a movie
Great introduction to the Star Wars universe
Itï¿ 1/2(TM)s a classic
"Behind George Lucas mesmerizing imagination, Star Wars marked an era for cinema as a whole, becoming more than an event and developing in an almost-cult for nerd culture. This space opera entails everything that made the saga as popular as it is. An underdog story, great character development, a unique world, an iconic villain, and a futuristic setting that encapsulated a whole generation and is a staple for modern pop culture as a whole."
"My all time favorite movie. Although I wasn’t introduced to this franchise until later in my life, my introduction couldn’t have been more enthralling. Despite the fact that I’ve seen this movie countless times, I still find myself on the edge of my seat during the climactic showdown on the Death Star, due to the amazing world and characters that George Lucas took great care in bringing to life. One of my few select “perfect movies”."
This is my favorite movie of all time. It keeps my attention throughout the entire movie no matter how many times I watch it.
Great for the time.
"Now to finally talk about something positive after i ranted about the shit jedi, Star wars, The film that started it all, this film and the other 6 star wars films are my childhood, i love all the star wars movies, that i accept as canon for me flawlessly except for rogue one, tfa and solo ( i dont accept tlj as canon), so i love star wars 1-6 flawlessly, jar jar and all, people doubted george lucas when this film first came out and he proved all those naysayers wrong, and star wars after 1977 become probably the most popular and beloved space franchises of all time until december 2018 when the shit jedi came out,"
"Star Wars is an amazing film, but somewhat overrated. Why does it have a higher audience score than genuinely better movies like The Terminator, Blade Runner, Face/Off, Spider-Man 2, Iron Man, and Logan? All of those movies are better than Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. People (especially Baby Boomers and Xennials) are blinded by nostalgia. This movie's plot is very simple to understand. There is a galactic civil war going in a different galaxy far away from the Milky Way. The war is between the Galactic Rebellion (the good ones) and the Galactic Empire (the evil ones). There was an ancient group of skilled warriors who have laser swords as weapons, know the ways of the Force (some binding energy surrounding the galaxy), and were the guardians of peace and justice known as the Jedi (singular and plural) who are extinct in this time period. The only remaining Jedi is Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi who is an old hermit that lives in a sandy planet called Tattooine. The protagonist of this movie is a 17-year-old farm boy named Luke Skywalker who lives on Tattooine with his aunt and uncle who are farmers. There is a space princess named Leia Organa. There is a space outlaw named Han Solo. There is a gold protocol droid named C3PO. There is a little cute droid named R2D2. The characters are great and all have personality. Luke is a young, adventurous, enthusiastic, brave, heroic boy who dreams of becoming a Jedi Knight like his father was. Ben is a lonely old man who is kind, helpful, witty, and full of wisdom. Leia is a damsel in distress but then becomes a badass female and is a good rebel leader. C3PO is a prissy, cowardly, amusing, cautious, sensitive, and friendly robot. R2D2 is a cute droid that just says bee-boo-boo-bop. Han is a cool bad boy type of guy who is a space outlaw, but then as the movie progresses he slowly starts to become a good guy. The action scenes in this movie are great. The lightsaber battle is really dated and underchoreographed but was probably a good fight scene for its time. The story is amazing. The acting is good. The soundtrack is wonderful. This movie is a timeless classic. George Lucas invented and created a huge and iconic concept and franchise.

Rating: 9.7/10"
A beautiful sci-fi movie to start the adventure of the Skywalker family.
amazing but not 5 star because there is better ones in the orginal trilogy.
The First Star Wars Outing Is One Of The Best
Hard to be objective with this one.... but one of the best of all time. Nuff said!
A fresh start(literally)
"Film history aside A new hope is just very good filmmaking. Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and itâ(TM)s a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you havenâ(TM)t already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga.(Lucas's masterful direction make this a great watch)."
"I don't have much to say about A New Hope, other than it's an awesome movie that started an awesome franchise. A New Hope has a great soundtrack, story, and very memorable characters, and it does everything else competent enough. It's definitely my second favorite Star Wars movie, a classic. It gets a 9/10."
"As a dedicated Star Wars fan, to me, this is the pinnacle of everything a movie should be. It represents a classical story arc with a sci-fi twist. It's an incredibly fun view, even if it doesn't hold up to modern-day graphics.
 The only thing that I'd say is a detriment to this movie, unlike the others in the saga, is that the storyline itself is a little shallow. The film opts for a fun ride rather than a deeper dive. However, that is one of the best points of ""A New Hope"" as well, because it doesn't really spend any time wallowing in plot.
Overall, ""A New Hope"" still holds a special place in my, and the worldwide audience's heart, as it captures near perfection for a quality watch."
"This is one of the best movies of all time, this film made scifi mainstream, and elevated movie special effects to an artform. It is and always will be the standard all epic movies will be judged against."
This is a flawless movie imo. One of the best of all times.
Great film unlike the last Jedi
"It is and will always be, one the the most groundbreaking films in history."
"Uno dei film più importanti della storia del cinema, ha praticamente inventato il concetto moderno di blockbuster. I suoi effetti sono stati estremamente innovativi, fanno scuola ancora oggi, e né la fantascienza, né il fantasy sarebbero quello che sono oggi senza questa pellicola. Star Wars è l'epica moderna, quello che l'Odissea, l'Iliade, Ercole erano per il mondo antico, e tutto è nato da questo ""piccolo"" grande film."
"Refreshingly original for its time and inspiring a new era of entertainment and media, ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" proves to be one of the greatest blockbusters of all time."
"Seeing this movie for the first time is one of the greatest movie experiences most people ever have, it is truly magical."
"I wasn't alive when this movie was made (born in 1986), but it is incredible in my opinion. Everything about it seemed so real and it truly felt like it happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. This movie will be timeless, especially for people who enjoy storytelling and character development. If you're into visuals and those types of movies then you will have a hard time viewing this movie. You almost have to put yourself in the time period of the mid/late 70s when watching this movie to get a full appreciation of it. 5/5 stars for me."
"I can't believe how they saved this movie in the editing, but they did."
This movie changed movie making and story telling in movies.  still a great movie today with a positive message.  i watched this movie daily as a kid.
"This is how you do star wars Disney, LEARN FROM THIS."
It’s amazing how this movie holds up over time.
"Great movie!  Tech doesn't hold up well, though"
One of the greatest fantasy films of all time.
"While most of the effects REALLY don't hold up, as well as most of the acting, A New Hope is still a really enjoyable film that revolutionized film as a whole.

7/10"
"Kickstarted arguably the biggest Hollywood franchise of all time. And 41 years later, it still is amazing."
"This film borrows from themes from myth and legend that came before it. Something Disney Star Wars just doesn't get! Instant classic. Try and find the original version, not the special edition hot mess."
I loved this iconic film. Lacks something however I don't know what it is.
"Great, iconic, sci-fi movie that still holds up today. Not much more needs to be said."
The start to George Lucas's iconic Star Wars franchise is a very solid introduction into the universe of Star Wars. If you're looking for some classic heros vs villains with a space opera twist look no further than A New Hope.
Best movie of all time
A legendary classic that changed cinema forever.
"How is this not 100? 
Smh.
So your telling me there is a better movie that did a better job this then after all these years ? Really ?"
The first film in a saga that has changed the film industry.
World-changing and life altering.  People of all ages and backgrounds can get something out of Star Wars
"Set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope starts the Star Wars saga off strongly, with stellar acting, a good script, and an exciting story."
"Film History began with A New Hope in 1977 and to this day its effects are being felt in Hollywood. Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels.

Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga."
A film that still holds up to today and will be a classic for generations to come.
"This film is the standard by which all other action/scifi movies are measured. The pacing, camera work, and character development is taught in film schools and written about in film theory books all over the world."
"Film history aside A new hope is just very good filmmaking.

"A classic, that to be honest has plenty of cheese."
"One of two MUST WATCH films, in this series, in all of cinema."
"I can still remember standing in line with my Dad as a child to go see this masterpiece. The original Trilogy is the best by far. Thank you George for making my child hood amazing. FYI do not see the new Star Wars movies if you like the books, comics, original Trilogy, and even the second trilogy, Last Jedi does not follow the Star Wars lure it will ruin the other movies for you"
The movie that started the summer blockbuster.
"Lucas is the best movie maker of all time to create a new universe or awesome creatures and new worlds, Thank you George for inventing the best thing of life Star Wars I will always love star wars seen it 100s or thousands of times, I live star wars"
A pretty much perfect space opera. I'd say it was perfection if this saga wasn't about to go one better......
one of the greatest fantasy adventures ever
"While its not perfect, A New Hope is a great start to the Star Wars franchise with its energetic space fights, and fun characters."
"This movie is a masterpiece, absolutely, no question"
"Star wars was the movie that started the best sci-fi saga of all time! It was a great film with characters that we have come to know and love like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, R2-D2, C3P0, obi wan Kenobi, and of course Darth Vader. It's just an absolute masterpiece!"
The movie that started the legendary saga.
"I used to not like this movie. But I got the chance to watch it a couple months ago, and I really liked it. I saw what people liked in it. It has its flaws, still a great movie though."
Absolutely legendary movie in my opinion just as good as Empire. George lucas created a masterpiece
"A milestone in film history, with revolutionary ideas and themes"
The best Star Wars movie.
"The first Star Wars movie is fresh and original with great action throughout. Unlike future entries, this is based of nothing whatsoever. This is the best Star Wars movie without a doubt.
-9/10"
"A New Hope (1977): Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga."
The epic that started it all
"This movie started my favorite franchise on planet earth. Star Wars has very iconic moments, iconic characters, and iconic lines. Star Wars is a true classic."
A good movie but underwhelming and disappointing given the hype about it
"I like it but, for some reason the original trilogy always seemed to bland for me"
A true classic. Can watch it over and over and over and never get sick of it.
"This is one of the most epic, amazing, and mind blowing movies of all time. I rarely give movies 5 stars but Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope is a great Sci-Fi movie, and a classic. In fact I have seen this so much and every time I watch it, it only gets better. It just blows your mind. Star Wars is an emotional story and has GREAT character development. And the planets and creatures are amazing. From small little cute Ewoks to big great evil Rancors I love this movie. I do recommend this movie."
Great movie. Revolutionary.
"Possibly the best film ever made, it has everything you need."
"Too good for words. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"What is there to say about one of, if not THE most influential blockbuster film ever made? It's story and visuals have fueled decades worth of sequels, books, comics, games and TV series, and continues to enthrall new generations of fans. The film is exciting in nearly every respect, with great characters that we can identify with and builds to a nail biting climax. There are a couple of weak moments, such as Luke not mourning the gruesome death of aunt and uncle, but they don't distract from the excitement too much. 

What is most impressive about A New Hope is that it tells an amazing story that stands on it's own. Even if there hadn't been another Star Wars movie, we could still watch this one in awe of every new planet or creature, cheer for the heroes and hiss for the bad guys when they're on screen. It's that type of movie: no matter how cynical a viewer, this is one that grabs you and all but forces you to enjoy every minute. The definition of a classic film."
"5/5.  The original Star Wars is a near perfect film with excellent acting, awesome effects, and some of the best pacing and energy ever captured on film."
"How can anyone not love this movie?  The heros journey complete with a set of believable villains, well rounded characters, and a struggle to survive impossible odds.  It's beauty is in its ability to deliver a quality story anyone can relate to.  No build up, right into the action."
"Kicking off one of the most iconic cinematic franchises, ""A New Hope"" was the beginning of the Star Wars universe and released in theaters way back in 1977, over 40 years ago. It's the film that introduced us to this whole new galaxy of heroes that we love, like Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie, but also one of the most menacing and infamous villains in the history of cinema, Darth Vader. In the midst of a civil war between the Rebellion, led by Princess Leia and the Empire, who aims to build a space station called the Death Star and use it as a weapon, the rebels are captured by the evil Sith Lord, Darth Vader. In order to help the rebels destroy the Death Star, a young Jedi, Luke, must team up with the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookie friend, Chewbacca. The cast is very carefully selected, particularly the main trinity of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. The film is packed with insanely entertaining and timeless sequences of action, humor and drama. The practical and visual effects are top notch quality and astonishingly refreshing and creative for the time that the film was released and still manage to hold up nicely. The score by John Williams is absolutely epic and unlike anything that has ever been heard. In other words, ""A New Hope"" is a flawlessly crafted space opera and only the beginning of an unforgettable adventure."
Lol!!! Very liked han solo!!
"Was the best film in its time, but has not aged well at all, most effects are now too obvious and film has come along way."
"While not my favorite Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope is still a great sci-fi opera film! Not much to add here that hasn't already been said. Its a timeless classic."
"Sure, it's movie #1 for the Star Wars franchise, but it does seem a little bland in the 21st century. Probably the least entertaining lightsaber duel, but there are yet some decent sequences."
"The first will always be my favorite! The heroes journey of Luke Skywalker, the badass Princess Leia, the smooth -talking smuggler Han Solo, the wise old Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the awesome villainy of Darth Vader just cannot be topped!"
Had to watch this cinematic masterpiece again just to cleanse my mind and spirit of that abomination that was The Last Jedi.  Thank you for this George Lucas.
"Freaking kitashi mushrooms!!! Nothing more iconic and nothing more awesome than watching Han, Leia and Luke along with Darth Vader. Cinematic piece of history!"
Love Love Love it!!!
"My favorite Star Wars movie. One of the greatest hero's journey in all of cinema. A classic, what can I say, it will never age."
"Fantastic story, acting, music and combines TOGETHER... created something truly amazing."
The movie that started it all mega han shot first though nuff said
Original 1977 release is my all-time favourite movie.
ONe the best sci fi movies ever
"When I saw Star Wars for the first time when I was 15, I was immediately captivated and absorbed every Star Wars story I could find like a sponge. It literally defined my sense of right and wrong during my formative teen years because the lessons in pre-Disney Star Wars are timeless, and I love the sequels even more.

It's a triumphant classic that coined the concept of ""blockbuster"". I shouldn't need to have to say anything else about it. I can't wait to introduce my boys to it, and the entire Expanded Universe."
"This was by far the best Star Wars film, being the original. The amazing visual effects and acting make the film almost perfect. Darth Vader and Han Solo are probably the two most iconic characters from this film. Han has his charm and Harrison Ford plays him like he has been Han all his life. Did I mention that all of the actors and actresses are like that? James Earl Jones has a certain thing to his voice which makes him seem like just the person to play Darth Vader. The movie tells a complete story in my opinion, but you can add to your Star Wars experience with the amazing 2 additions to this trilogy. The mediocre prequel trilogy from the early 2000s are bad. The new trilogy is pretty good. The new prequel trilogy is okay. Overall, Star Wars: A New Hope is an amazing film to get to watch, and it's an essential must watch for all movie lovers. I'll give A New Hope a 100%. I'd really recommend that anyone who loves movies should see this."
"Honestly, a well-made movie that shows what can happen when people work together to make something great. Worth your time."
The film that starts the Star Wars franchise.Star Wars : Episode IV-A New Hope has a wonderful story with incredible action scenes and excellent visual effects
This is the reason people love ?? Star Wars
Love this movie! GreAt introduction to the biggest franchise! Love Luke Leia and Han. Very fun and incredible visuals.
Classic. One of the best movies of all time.
"The first time I saw this, I had to stand in a long line in a Manhattan Theater for a sold out show.  Then I saw it 4 more times after that.  The story was great but there had never been animation like that before.  It was amazing."
The best of the best
"41 years later, this film is a must watch for any star wars fan."
The original and one of the best movies in the franchise. Great story and great introduction to the best and most loved characters.
The classic that started it all.
A classic with an excellent story and great characters.
Amazing film is impossible to hate.
"While slow at times, with dated effects. The practical effects still shine through. george lucas's original vision was fantastic. The Score of course shines through, thanks to john williams. It's a must watch, sitting through the cheesy moments is worth it."
The movie that started it all. The movie is amazing and still holds up today. Darth Vader is an epic main villain and the hero cast is also amazing. This movie is still one of the best movies of all time.
The film that started it all!
"The first of the original trilogy and thus gold, but Empire Strikes Back was a better movie. I must give it high marks however because it started it all and was a breakthrough in technology and storytelling at the time."
"The first and the best one out of the saga (1-8). Excellent writing, outstanding characters, and a wounderful soundtrack. Just a masterpiece and a great classic. George changed the world with this one. 5*"
"One of the greatest films of all time. I wish they never made another one after Empire. Its too bad what's happened since then. The special editions, the prequels and all the Disney movies have almost ruined the original. My advice is to get a hold of the despecialized version, forget all the nonsense that's happened to the films since 1981, and just enjoy it as it was."
"Epic, and fearless.  Great characters (unafraid to give non-humans, women, and guys who shoot first, a key role). Vader deserves his iconic status.  Luke was a great pilot and a great shot but could not USE the force or a light saber because no training had occurred...prefect heroes-journey movie for Luke and Han, perfect subversion of the ""princess"" stereotype, immaculate score, unbelievable (for its time) effects, amazing cinematography, great ensemble chemistry, (apparently) inspired editing, the list goes on!  Topped only by Empire, but not enough to remove 1/2 a star in comparisson (I can't give it 4.95 stars). A shining beacon of perfection and good film making, before the dark times..."
"Great film, loved it."
"Not my favorite one but I like Obie wan vs Darth Vader that was a good fight other then that night my favorite, maybe if there was more action and light saber battles that would’ve been nice! But now we have Luke skywalker that’s gonna learn how to be a Jedi. But will he know how to use the force and learn well."
"Classic. Princess Leia is actually a thoughtful and compassionate leader (unlike in the newest films where she's reduced to a throwaway prop). Luke, Han and Chewie and the entire rebellion are fun to root for :) very visceral and all done with 70's era sfx which show how much Lucas cared about his audience and his story :)"
"I watched this release in 1977 over 27 times while living in Hawaii. By far, the best movie George put out!"
An amazing movie has aged well
"Not just nostalgia, but this is a superb high fantasy space opera adventure"
What is there to say.. The film that started it all.
Easily one of the best movies ever made.
"Thank you, George Lucas! That is all."
Best movie in the 70s era
The Movie that started it all. I will treasure it....Always.
Just about as perfect a movie as has ever been made.
"Love, Love, Love this movie! Every time I watch this movie I go to a galaxy far far away...."
"One of the most iconic and and kickstarters to a franchise, this movie delivers incredible action, creatures and engulfs you in the world of Star Wars."
Incredible movie. The fact that this movie hasnt aged a bit in 40 odd years is incredible. The benchmark star wars movie!
Everyone says Empire Strikes Back is the best. Nah. This movie will always be the best for me. Works as a standalone film. Works as Part One of a trilogy. And it even works as a sequel to Ep3 and Rogue One. Timeless classic. Had to come review it just to pay my respects. Have to watch it again soon to get the disgusting taste of The Last Jedi out of my mouth.
This is my favorite movie of all the franchise. It has everything a hero's journey needs. Visionary in its time and still holds up today. Still hopeful and holding out for a release of the unmodified original on BluRay.
"This brings me so many good memories! What a great introduction to the franchise, innovating, heartfelt, and unique! Love this movie!"
The best of course of all the movies that follow. It may be old but it still is worthy to this day for generations to enjoy.
"A very good film for the time, pure entertainment"
A timeless classic.  Enduring and endearing.
One of the greatest films of all time!
"Dated, I was Rooting for the Empire, against the Empire, Luke Lost his Uncle and Aunt but  was more concerned about a mangy Wizard, and Leia led the Deahstar back to the Base, KNOWINGLY... Why didn't the Empire Search for a Flaw when try left Immediately..
 The Rebels found it Immediately, and Crash a Star Destroyer over the Hole???"
An amazing film that would be remembered by everyone in the future. It's sad because TFA was pretty much just ANH with some things changed.
The iconic start to an immortal franchise..Enjoyable from beginning to end.
"Not Gonna lie, this is probably my favourite movie of all time, Sure its a bit outdated, But when You feel like the more recent star wars movies are weighing you down, you still have this to come back to."
A awesome display of a action movie that displays out of this world heroism. Loved this film
"When I watched this, it was what brought me into cannon. Such struggle, you really see the characters rise"
For original not bullshit remake.
This is a masterpiece of a film because the way that George Lucas thought of this idea is incredible. The acting is fantastic in this film. Han Solo is my favourite character because how he acts like a know it all if you what I mean. My favourite part in the movie is when Luke looks at the two suns and the music playing behind it. John Williams does an excellent score in this movie as well. I love how everything is basically is a set and not made in CGI. I like how this movie is still watchable today and I hope it will be in the future. I really enjoy this movie and I'm definitely going to give it five stars.
"With a scale and ambition worthy of praise, ""A New Hope"" introduces a universe of unrecognizable scale that will forever remain timeless due to the near-mythological story structure and the easily identifiable arc that allows it to effectively stand alone as a formidable story of its own. To this day, it remains the only Star Wars film that can exist independent of all its successors and still make sense."
"Loved the story, but the graphics were like the same as Mary Poppins."
AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS BACK THEN
A New Hope is a legendary piece of film making and changed the landscape of cinema with incredible special effects and excellent characterization.
"The original ""Star wars"" will always be a classic, no matter what."
timeless and ageless classic
"Classic Story, masterful editing, magical sets and places, reinvented the genre 
-nough said"
"Love all Originals and Prequels, wish I could say the same for the Sequels"
"Star wars is a combination of action, humour, etc.. close to anything a perfect movie could be."
"A fantastic beginning to a journey to one of the most infamous sci-fi sagas in our long history. A new hope gives us character, tone, dialogue, and good acting, which is something the prequels completely lack. A great and memorable movie."
The first film in my favorite trilogy of all time.
A great Star Wars classic with blood
Balls to the wall fun
The movie that launched my imagination and gave me hope... 'nuff said...
star wars is one of the best film's you can find it has great characters and a simple but great plot a classic every one need's to see
The greatest fantasy film of all time.
"As of today the ""Professional"" critics have A New Hope (the original Star Wars) at 93%. And The Last Jedi at 91%. As if they were anywhere near each other! Disgraceful. Zero professional integrity!"
"What can you say, it’s the original. Rating: 4.5/5 87%"
"The introduction to one of the greatest movie trilogy’s ever created, 1 million stars."
Really good. But the special edition nearly ruins it.
the beginning of a legend
pure funn and thats what i want inn a starwars movie
"An absolute classic of a movie, even if it's not my go to for re-watching."
"A classic sci-fi film with groundbreaking special effects, fun characters and an equally thrilling story."
"With an enduring cast of characters, groundbreaking special effects, amazing music and a very simple story of good vs evil, the original star wars remains one of cinema's most important films. While there is some prequel-esque dialogue around, the movie is much better paced, directed and acted than those later films. An absolute must-watch."
Epic! A titan of pure sci fi greatness
The anthem to my childhood
"This is a fun adventure/sci-fi movie that has stayed with me ever since I first saw it at the theater when I was a child. Empire may be the best movie of the original three but this is certainly the most fun. Regardless of where the franchise has gone over the years, this will always be one of my favorite movies."
Great and very rewatchable
"This will never be as compelling of a story or visually stunning as Empire, it is still one of the greatest films ever made. With characters and scenes that will forever be remembered."
gotta love the cheesy acting
"If you're gonna start watching Star Wars, this is where you start. One of the most innovative movies ever, your journey begins here."
"The first, and the best Star Wars movie. Sure, the lightsaber duel doesn't really hold up very well, but that's just one scene. Everything else about the movie is just as flawless and awesome today, as it was 40 years ago."
An absolute classic.
Obi Wan dies. I love Star Wars.
"to be honest I've never been massively blown away by A New Hope. I find the pacing a little slow but in terms of iconic story telling, characters, genre defining and innovative, it's a cut above the rest a film on which so many dreams have been made"
"Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope began this legendary Sci-fi franchise in a spectacular way, by blending in long-lasting effects with good setting and audio, creating a flawless movie inhabited by iconic characters, terrific storyline and some of the most memorable moments and locations to ever brace the big screen."
"Well, who hasn't seen this film?"
"With a terrific story, awesome score and a talented cast, Star War a New Hope, delivers on so many levels."
"It's a classic and everyone loves it! It has plenty of flaws though. In all honesty, If I had never seen this movie until I was an adult it would be forgettable."
"The movie has a strange feeling at the beginning, Tarkin makes a profound tone in the movie, is all a trip to some interesting cultures, it's very technical, the attack on the death star scene is very exciting, the concept of the force feel good, is strange, amusing and enjoyable"
"I watched this first run in 1977 and was awestruck.  How lucky I am to be able to see this great universe revisited in 2018!  Too cool, keep the movies coming."
If you have not watched any of the original saga.  There is something wrong with you.  All three legendary movies go down as some of the greats!
"the best space opera movie with empire strikes back. it is a masterpiece that combines the classical hero saga to japanese samurais, arabic figures, the western knights, the idea of 'chakra', classical sci-fi films, and lovable characters."
This is one of the BEst filmd ever made
Pinnacle of story telling
"A good opening film to a franchise, it lays a lot of groundwork. Unfortunately because of this the film (particularly the first 40 minutes) feels a little slow.  Whenever i introduce people to this franchise i always worry that they feel a little bored during this one. Overall though a good movie. Luke can be a little bit whiny and Leia keeps switching between a British and American accent (which one could argue she uses to mock the imperials, most of which have British accents). 

This movie pays homage to many classics though, with a classic, yet simple story of a farm boy, and a wizard rescuing a princess, with its Flash Gordan style of opening crawl, ties to Japanese samurai movies and classic swashbuckling movies and WW2 dogfighting movies whats not to love? Star Wars takes all of these ideas and weaves them into something new and fresh. Even if a little slow, this movie is worth a watch. Go check it out."
i think this movie is better than citzen kane
"A classic that has withstood many generations to remain both a household classic and a household name. Star Wars has become perhaps the single greatest cultural addition to mankind that cinema has ever brought us, and nothing in cinema has been the same since Star Wars."
A wonderful piece of cinematography.
A great movie that feels timeless and great and its an amazing film
"A magic journey into, what some believe to be a life changing experience, just like me."
From the characters to the story to the visuals this movie has everything required for a perfect fantasy sci-fi adventure movie.
One Of The Best Sci Fi Movies Ever Made
It's Star Wars. Nuff said.
"The original Star Wars managed to shock audiences with it's great storyline, world-building, and visual effects for the time. Star Wars is a timeless classic, and is almost a masterpiece...Yet it isn't the best film in the star-wars universe...
 I'll give it 
         - 94%"
Classic movie with overall cheesy acting and a basic plot line but there's a reason its the most enduring film franchise of the modern era.
"The movie that shaped my childhood, enough said."
"A legendary beginning to an iconic saga, Star Wars: A New Hope is one of the greatest sci-fi fantasy films in existence. It offers love-able characters, beautiful surroundings and an enticing story. I give A New Hope 96%."
"This is the first installment of George lucas's intergalactic fairytale. The first time it was stunning and even now it's still a joy to watch. In this film we see Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford at their best. And we are introduced to three characters who will forever have a place in everyone's heart, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2"
"A wonderful piece of cinematography. The plot, acting, music, everything just steller."
"Although I like to watch them chronologically, this is the movie that started a phenomenon that became my life!"
"The film that started it all meets a very tall order: It establishes a universe. Though very little of the galaxy is ultimately explored, this movie invents the landscape and history Star Wars from scratch. Every character in this film is also a standout, and Luke works as a very likable and relatable protagonist. Despite clear aging, this film is definitely one that will withstand the test of time."
One of the best movies ever and it changed the face of movies has great graphics for a 70s movie
One of the greatest movies of all time

"One of the great films of the 20th century.  Started a whole revolution in filmaking.  Second only to "" Emipre "" in this saga."
There is a reason everyone loves the original movies.  The writing/story has yet to be matched by the sequels.  Some of the parts of this trilogy are genuinely awe inspiring.
"The movie that revolutionised special effects is something that is worth re-watching for me just before I go and see a new Star Wars movie. Almost everyone in the galaxy would gloss over this film as being one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. The CGI in this movie still holds up today and this was released in 1977! Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, James Earl Jones and Alec Guinness are all great as their iconic movie characters. This movie is the greatest sci-fi movie of all time (until ""The Empire Strikes Back""."
Great First Film!!!!!
Created the most popular movie fantasy world.
"This movie only has a good rating because it has the name ""star wars"" plastered on it. The first hour of the movie is filled with cheap and forgettable dialogue while the rest of the movie is filled with cheap and forgettable special effects. A true train wreck, in every sense of the phrase, yet somehow this movie sparked a cult phenomenon....I'm baffled."
"This masterpiece changed the way movies are made. With a perfectly-fitting cast, great practical effects, and the introduction of (arguably) the most iconic movie villain of all time, A New Hope thrilled audiences everywhere and will continue to do so for years to come."
"I used to not like Star Wars when I was young, but since I saw this film on Saturday night, I feel I'm nearly becoming a Star Wars fan.
It's a really great film - with perfect musical score, characters and a perfect storyline. George Lucas really has done a good job on this one.
Give this film a gold star - or a star war! I think a gold star should do it!"
I could watch this a thousand times and still not tire of it. They can't make films like this any more..
This is THE BEST star wars movie imo this made my childhood. i cant explane in a few words. 9.9/10
"This is my 3rd favorite Star Wars movie. The movie that started a spectacular franchise. This movie is one of the best movies ever made. Even though I was not alive when it was first release back in 1977 it is one of my favorite movies of all time. It has an amazing storyline and screenplay. The actors Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, and Mark Hamill gave stupendous performances. The visuals and animatronics were gorgeous especially R2-D2. The musical score was also amazing. A+"
"I vaguely remember watching this when it broadcasted on UK TV in 1988. I was 8 years old at the time. All I could remember was getting the toys for the following Christmas not really knowing what I'd gotten! Back than I was more into Fantasy and cartoons (like He-Man, Dungeons & Dragons, Visionaries, The Storyteller) than Sci-Fi and movies.

It wasn't until 1991 when The Empire Strikes Back broadcasted on Christmas Eve that I began to recognise how much of an impact this franchise would be to me. Then The Return of the Jedi broadcasted 4 months later to complete the trilogy. I finally got a copy of A New Hope a couple months later on VHS and would go on to watch the trilogy in one whole weekend. Then did it again the following weekend and numerous weekends thereafter until the VHS tape got too worn out!

I was 12 by the time I got to watch A New Hope again. 4 years since my first viewing when I admittedly disinterested. This time I was ""mature"". More ""worldly"" and ""aware"" of myself(!) There I felt I could relate to Luke Skywalker struggles with his responsibilities and also the wanting of finding adventure.

The movie had all the ingredients I sought for in my fantasy genre programmes despite being a Sci-fi movie and in a galaxy far far away. it was in an era that was a long time ago, with mysticism, magic, and heroism. It had the protagnist whom I could relate to, a wisened teacher, the rebelious but loyal friend and his obscure sidekick. At the time I saw Leia as the token female of the group, but quickly came to realise she was just as important and much needed to the group than any other member. The diversity of the different races, all being able to communicate with each other regardless of how fantastic their language was.

A marvellous story throughtout that made me laugh, cry and cheer. Despite requiring a second viewing, it is arguably my favourite of the original trilogy."
"Brilliant film! Wow for originality!  Awesome special effects, amazing characters and epic space battles. One of the best films of all time."
I love the original Star Wars best movies I remember from my childhood!
What can you say? It's the film that started it all...
"A New Hope is simply a masterpiece.  All of the characters are, beyond a shadow of a doubt, iconic and eternally memorable, but Alec Guinness and Harrison Ford's performances stand out among the rest of the cast.  The story is so unique and exciting that even now, over four decades later, movies still struggle to top it.  Filled to the brim with action, emotion, and rich storytelling, this is a gem to behold.  Don't even get me started on the soundtrack.  I really don't have much more to add, all you need to know is that this is where the fun began."
"This movie is a top contender for the most entertaining piece of art ever played in cinemas. From beginning to end, this movie presents the viewer with a universe audiences never imagined could be shown in such an entertaining and action packed way and with every watch it never fails to leave me with a sense of awe. Each character, location, scene, piece of music, line of dialogue, and blaster bolt fired is extremely memorable and will forever remain an essential part of pop culture. For 1977, this movie was revolutionary for audiences that had never seen anything like it. Sci Fi was a nearly dead genre, and this movie revived it. Sure, it has a relatively simple story, but I have never cared about something so simple more in my life. The main trio of actors, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher deliver spectacular performances as what would become three of the most well known cinema characters of all time. Sir. Alec Guinness shines in this movie and is one of the last remnants of the Jedi order that we would not see in its prime for another twenty two years until ""The Phantom Menace"" and he gives an amazing performance. Darth Vader, perhaps the best villain ever created for cinema, is a force to be reckoned with and rightfully so. This man is an absolute badass that strikes fear into the hearts of anyone that has the displeasure of looking him in the mask (that's why he is creepily looming in the background for the poster of the movie). All characters aside, the special effects and graphics of this movie are absolutely phenomenal and blew the minds of viewers when it initially came out. If I said anymore, I'd simply be saying even more things that you already know. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it. Now."
One of my favorite movies of all time
"The iconic twin suns, could the second sun be a hint at the skywalker twin dynasty? Who knows.
A movie destined to fail, has risen to the ranks of legend."
"This is the Luke we want, not the monstrosity that Beta male cuck Rian johnson and Feminazi Kathleeen Kennedy engendered."
"The greatest single piece of art ever created by man.   So staggeringly good that even now it has only been desecrated by sacreligious remakes.   Sure empire might have more action and twists......but this stands alone, complete.  As much as you can say star trek after kirk n spok was no longer star trek....one if a true purist can say everythign after this is not really star wars.  Certainly everything after the first 3 movies.  I am so sad lucas did not make more than the first 3 while young and hungery still......before the sjw cancer set in in the 90s ruining scifi boosk NBA and everything...."
The movie that changed everything
Greatest film of all time.
"Nice movie, not better than its sucessor, but still very good."
"Very entertaining and exciting story, never a dull moment in this film. Some of it felt a little cheesy but in a fun way."
"George Lucas'  Star Wars: A New Hope set the gold standard for the science fiction genre, bringing to life a beautifully crafted story that will go down in history as one of, if not the best film, of all time."
"One of the greatest trilogies out there, the beginning of a near perfect sci fi story telling, of the Hero's journey, a template of ""The Hero with a thousand faces"" showcased to the point here, simply timeless and fantastic. 

Disney will never achieve this magic, because they don't have what it takes to make such a movie."
Must see in its original theatrical cut as restored by Harmy in the Despecialized Edition.
This is one of the two greatest movies every made.
The movie that started it all!
Speaks for itself. Iconic. Brilliant. One of the greatest films of all time.
"A space adventure film of a bygone era, full of optimism, hope, romance.

Free of the modern Leftist and Feminist drive to portray women as one-dimensionally strong and flawless, Princess Leia is allowed to be the infinitely complex creatures that women are: beautiful and modest, strong and vulnerable, independent and motherly, caring and sassy.

The play between the characters is the real strength of this film.
The sci-fi action is the most childish - but it is a children's adventure film."
Absolutely groundbreaking. The best.
I give this a 99/A+.
It has it flaws but it is Great. I was not born when it came out but this made me love star wars for my entire life. To bad the Last Jedi was so terrible that it tarnished the Star wars Franchise
One of the greatest movies of all time!
5>4>6>>7>R1>3>1>2>>>8
A masterpiece 40 years ahead of its time!
One of the best films ever made!
"Not Only A Classic
But A Part Of History"
"Epochal, innovative, magical, cultic, incredible. The film gave me the magic of childhood."
Saw it opening day and over a hundred times since. Fantastic.
"A masterpiece, an iconic work which sets the pace for all action sci-fi movie from then one.
Characters, storyline, quotes, special effects, from laser swords duels to epic X-wing to H-wing duels ... just memorable."
"Great story.  Feels fantasy, optimistic and uplifting. Easy watching and entertaining."
"This has been, and will forever be the greatest movie in the franchise, and perhaps one of the greatest all-time. Even if Star Wars did not continue past this movie, it could standalone and still be an all-time Classic."
"I saw this back in 1977 when it was originally called Star Wars, Episode IV. This was the most entertaining movie I have experienced and have yet to feel that again even now. I thought Mr. Lucas did not add anything to it by adding digitalized scenes and adding New Hope to the moniker."
Where it all began....... Really.......
The movie that started it all. Star Wars has been a big part of my life.
"The original Star Wars film that was just fantastic even today, with great characters and plot."
"I remember seeing this a few times in the theater and at the drive-in when I was four. I was mesmerized from the opening. Spaceships, laser guns, and light sabers. I was hooked."
An amazing start for an amazing trilogy! An New Hope is a film that would start an empire! One of the greatest!
"Star Wars - A New Hope is a classic! The plot is exciting,  the visuals are iconic & the characters are the most memorable in film history! Definitely a must watch!"
"The greatest film ever made, and yea the greatest art ever made.  America is the most moral country ever, and capitalism ended slavery."
A classic. Shame Disney has ruined the Universe this film started.
Great characters and great writing makes a great movie? Who knew?
"A New Hope is the textbook definition of a cinematic classic. Thanks to the ever-enduring legacy of Star Wars, it's more relevant than ever.

The film's iconic opening of a Star Destroyer chasing a rebel blockade runner is ingrained in the minds of an innumerable amount of people. It really gets the movie going. From there, it slows down a little too much in my opinion with a large focus on the droids R2 and C-3PO but it does pick up again.

The chemistry between Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is really prevalent here. George Lucas said he picked out actors that seemed like they could play old friends and it definitely shows. Alec Guinness also turns in a great performance by Obi-Wan Kenobi but I think the villains Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and Tarkin (Peter Cushing) are the standout roles. There's a reason Vader is considered one of the greatest movie villains. He has such a presence on screen.

A New Hope does a great job of making you feel like you're in another world, from the Mos Eisley Cantina scene to the power of the Death Star. I still think that many of the saga's best moments can be found in this film (the destruction of Alderaan and the Battle of Yavin come to mind). The second and third acts of the film are definitely the high points.

While I think that George Lucas improved after his first Star Wars outing, A New Hope is still a timeless film that will likely remain a favorite of both kids and adults forever."
"This movie will get you hooked into star wars. Some of the most iconic characters and lines come from this movie. If you haven't seen it I compel you to watch this original trilogy. However do not watch the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi) if you don't want to sour the taste of star wars."
My favorite movie of all time.... This is the type movie a person can watch over and over again and I have seen this more than any other movie ever.
Best film series ever
"Tremendous characterization, simple-effective plot, fabulous world building. This movie has everything the later installments lack. It is also beautiful."
A New Hope is one of the best movies and definitely one of the best Star Wars movies.  Just rewatched it after watching The Last Jedi.  Trying to forget everything about The Last Jedi.
All time favourite film ❤️
"Star Wars is a masterpiece of film, it is in a league of its own, what is amazing about this movie is not the acting that isn't all that great, or the sets which aren't all that great, or the special effects, though revolutionary for their time certainly have been since eclipsed, It is what happens in the rare event, that the right script, the right director, the right vision, the right actors, all come together, in a under dog long shot movie, that went over budget, almost was cancelled, everyone who was involved with it doubted it would be successful, and then, by some sheer moment of movie magic, John Williams score breathes life into it, Jame Earl Jones voice Darth Vader, the sound of light sabers and speeding space crafts all explode on the scene.  Suddenly the audience is looking at something we had never seen before, a magical movie with a princess, and a rescue, and a death star and space monkeys and what have you.  A surprising and addicting blockbuster that anyone who watches the original (not CGI remake) will recognize immediately as fun and entertaining, and an instant classic.  Not because its perfect, but because of its unpolished genius, this is a 100%, a real rarity in film. While Star Wars did not have deep characters, or shared deep insights into the human condition, it did share the basic formal of heroic myth in a very light and entertaining movie...that is the magic of movies."
"from my review on Comic Crusaders: incredible! What else can I say, in 9 films the creative juices are fresher than ever. The fact that they dare to take chances and have different creative teams on each film helps to keep the series fresh. They aren't just re-treading what went on before. There's interesting new characters as well as creatures that we've never seen before. There's the obligatory scroll which is always fun and then we jump directly into the action. We're not told how the alliance made such a quick comeback after chapter VII, we simply accept that it has. Star Wars has never been real big on long exposition, thank God. I'm trying not to do spoilers here, suffice to say that certain characters will rise in rank and certain others will be demoted. Other characters will learn about their abilities and grow up a little bit. Interestingly there is a gap between the critics and the audience likes on Rotten Tomatoes. the critics give the film, as of this writing, 93% approval but only 66% of the fan base liked it. (slight spoiler) Perhaps making a Star Wars film with the original cast but without Han Solo and only someone we've never seen before as a supposed friend was a mistake? Want some advice Disney? Bring back Han and Luke (unfortunately they can't bring back Lea.) We never saw them together in episodes VII or VIII and I want to see them in action one more time.

The story, as such, is incredibly fun and like I said It hits all the beats of a Star Wars movie. The action scenes and special effects are some of the most impressive ever filmed. Kylo Ren (Driver) now has some competition for the favor of the supreme leader in Gen. Hux (Gleeson) I must admit right now that I'm not that big of a fan of Adam Driver (here comes the hate mail) but I just don't think his Kylo Ren is a worthy successor to Darth Vader, even though Vader is technically his grandpa. He seems more whiney than threatening to me. It doesn't affect my liking of the film at all, in fact the supreme leader also chastises him as someone who couldn't beat a young girl who had never picked up a light sabre in her life, which I found very amusing and dead on to his villainous abilities. If he hadn't killed off his father (in a cheap move reminiscent of what might be the light sabre version of a sucker punch.) in # VII, one of the most popular characters in the franchises history, there would be very little about him to hate.
There is an interesting scene which makes me like him a little bit more this time around. When he comes up to general Lea's ship, he goes to put his hand on the trigger and hesitates. It does show a slight human side to him and compassion for his mother, which he had none for his father. However the strong points of the film are his mental connection with Rey, the Finn and Rose story is kind of uneven for the most part, they have a certain chemistry but it's wasted by that subplots outcome. The film could shave off 20 minutes and we wouldn't have missed much and it would have made a tighter, more enjoyable experience as it drags slightly in the middle.
The film's climax relies on a new kind of weapon and it's seemingly hopeless for the rebels. Will they make it out this time or will the Alliance prevail? I'm not gonna tell you, you will have to watch the film to find out. All I will say is that when they begin to deploy that weapon it reminds me of the original Star Trek episode The Doomsday Machine. Mark Hamill turns in his best performance ever as the reluctant Jedi that doesn't want to return to the fold and his reasoning is sound. Watching Rey try to convince him to return without quite knowing how is a good part of the fun in this film. ***1/2 (8.6 rating.)"
"A classic from the beginning, George Lucas introduced to us the blockbuster spectacle of a franchise filled with stunning fight sequences, and lovable characters portrayed by Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and the ever-great Alec Guinness."
Game changing classic movie. A must see.
"One of the best movies ever made. So original and unique. Great characters, dialogue, humour, special effects and action. Just a fun movie filled with adventure."
I give the original cut 5 stars. The special editions get 3 stars.
All the stars. This is top ten all time. I don’t know how you can watch and not love. *****
the first star wars movie i ever saw - love at first sight!
Entertains on a galactic level. A New Hope is arguably the most important blockbuster ever made.
"The film that started it all. A classic film that introduces us to the most iconic characters in film history. A great kick off to the original trilogy.  Even by today standards the film still looks great. Its visual effects are stunning and the story itself is still as satisfying as it was back in the late 70s. 

Final Score 9/10"
"A slow start, but the movie quickly picks up after an older character is introduced, becoming one of the most enjoyable movies, for both solo and group viewing, ever produced."
The movie that started it all. Second equal in the series with Rouge One after The Empire Strikes Back. And like for so many people one of the most defining events in my childhood. No other movie has been able to repeat what Star Wars A New Hope did in 1977 when it comes to the phenomenal way audiences responded to it's release and the positive hysteria that was created around it.
"Can't say enough about this movie.  Loved it when it came out, love it now.Great story of good vs evil, hope vs despair."
"(Original release) Perhaps slightly cheesy at times, but overall an extremely captivating and inspiring film."
"One of the most important films in the history of cinema, and  it's obvious why to anyone who treats themselves to it. A masterclass in editing, character development, and visual effects"
Cinematic and cultural MASTERPIECE
I never thought I'd like this franchise but after watching New Hope for the second time I've come to love the thing
"Are you kidding me? Does anyone need an explanation for why this movie is amazing. This is Star Wars. If you watch it fewer than 5,000 times before you die, you have wasted your time here on this planet."
Favorite movie of all time!
"One of the most important, and memorable, movies in history."
"a beginning of a journey never seem before sci-fi movie on that era, still relevant till today tech!"
"And epic story with great characters that have on screen chemistry, this movie is just shy of being the best one, the movie runs smooth and has almost nothing stopping the plot from advancing, not much to complain or talk about hear, it does what it does and does it all well, the only thing in i would say the acting falters a bit in parts but its not as bad as in the 2nd trilogy which i don't think is as bad as people say.  This movies popularity among the star wars fans in not just because it is the first it is because it one of the best put together scifi movies out there."
"Hope is with you, always."
"This movie was so well made, filled with great dialog, writing, and screenplay."
"A rip roaring, swashbuckling space adventure for the ages. A rare film that gets better with each passing year"
Non-special edition is what you want.
"After the blockbuster prequel Rogue One, ANH sucks! After a decent intro, we're treated to C3PO's big adventure. The whole thing is such meandering crap. Without Han Solo, this movie would probably be un-watchable. Most the other characters are whiny anal brats or masked weirdos.

A barren wasteland and dull hallway sets compose most this movie, besides the falcon set. Ship screens look dated. Geriatric geezers play with glow sticks, and they all run around a lot. They finish the movie with pilots who sound like telemarketers and redundant trench run scenes, because there weren't enough boring scenes in this load of garbage. Still needs a lot of editing, and a new soundtrack; like the one from Rogue One. So much of this movie is like reject material from a film-school project. Meh."
A game changing movie that holds up today.
"Puntaje Original: 7.5

Fantástica película, que marca el inicio de un de las mejores sagas en la historia del cine."
i love this movie so much. Definitly a classic in my book.
"4.5 Rating is for the theatrical release. ""Special"" edition pulls it down to a mere 3 stars.

Not a perfect film, but truly innovative and genre-defining. Broke out of the mediocre mold of 70s sci-fi flicks to singlehandedly resurrect the pulpy Space Opera. A must see."
"An absolute classic. Great performances, writing, and cinematography drive home one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Fantasy films of all-time. Darth Vader is the coolest."
The beginning of something truly Epic and original. Now being destroyed by Disney.
"The one that started it all! Star Wars Gabe is what other films never even dreamt of. The combination of genres and beloved characters make this film forever a classic in cinematic history. Complimented with terrific visuals that still hold up to this day, wonderful action sequences, and great performances that capture the essence of pure fun and adventure! Without a doubt one of the best in the entire franchise that makes the flaws easy to overlook."
"It's been written to death how Star Wars changed how we make and watch movies, pretty much to the point of cliché. I won't go into anything like that here, even though all of that is important and should be celebrated. I'm just going to focus on how great a film this is on its own. I think nowadays it can be overshadowed by The Empire Strikes Back as far as being the best Star Wars film. However, I think the two are on par with each other in such a great way; I alternate my favorite between them depending on the day/whichever one I'm currently rewatching. A New Hope is just so much pure fun. Its fast pace catches you right at the beginning and doesn't let you go until the credits roll. The story is almost simple when compared to the sequels and prequels that were to follow over the coming decades, but that's a good thing. On its own two legs, it's a fun adventure film. The cast goes a long way to contributing to that fun. There isn't a single weak link amongst the actors. I would praise individual performances of the main and even secondary casts, but I would be here all day. Something else that always manages to mesmerize me is the (original) special effects. For a movie that came out in 1977, they hold up really well for the most part, better even than some blockbusters that have come out in the 21st century. All of these elements - story, cast, effects - come together thanks to George Lucas' labor of love. Say what you will about his late-career endeavors, but this was the film that firmly established him as one of the great American filmmakers. I can gush on and on about this movie, so I should probably stop myself. Bottomline: if you somehow still haven't seen A New Hope, you're missing out."
"Star Wars, wonderful Star Wars... There is nothing better than the original. In this case that could not be more true. George Lucas's first entry into the multi billion dollar universe of Star Wars has its quirks but its great characters like Darth Vader, Old Ben Kenobi (AKA Obi Wan), and others like Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo all take you along a very memorable adventure across the galaxy attempting to stop the evil Empire advancing their Death Star. This is a great movie with a great plot and I highly recommend it, if you have not seen it then you probably have been living under a rock."
I’m glad I have a REAL star wars movie to watch after strangling myself through The Last Jedi
"An absolute classic. This movie has to be watched in the context of the era it was created. In doing so, one realizes that this was a brave and bold move at the time that took true creative vision and unprecedented talent to pull off."
"The one that started it all. The one that started the best movie series of all time, from the perfect characters and iconic locations this movie is amazing. This movie introduces arguably the best villain of all time. We get introduced to Han, Luke, and Leia, some of the best hero’s of all time. Not only that but the special effects from 1977 still hold up incredibly well today. Also The ending is incredible with the trench run at the end being amazing."
it was the best film ever in 1970s but now its like any other film
When Star Wars came out it was revolutionary. 30 years later it still captures that magic. The movie  looks phenomenal and every performance here is great. This is a movie that has aged very well.
origanal always great
What is there to say?
The one that started it all. Perhaps the best overall fim of all time.
"If you think about the genre ""Adventure"", you must think about Star Wars: episode IV. It's really a good start for the universe of Star Wars. It was (and still is, I think) a revolutionary movie."
"An absolute game changer. I used to not like the original Star Wars films because they were not as flashy as an Obi Wan vs. Darth Maul lightsaber duel. However, as I came to my senses, I realized that nothing would top this movie in terms of its musical score and its ability to introduce us to such a vast galaxy, still being explored today.

One of my all-time favorite films."
Lighting in a bottle. This movie started it.
"One of the best movies of all time. Not only did it introduce us to one of the best franchises in history, but it had a fantastic story with great writing and iconic characters."
Third best movie ever.
The greatest movie ever made.
"The legend movie that started it all. A true masterpiece of it's era, still a very good movie even today."
Fun filled adventure that begins an epic tale.
"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) (based on release date) - 10/10
Acting - 8/10
Sound/Music - 9/10
Film Storyline - 9/10

Overall - 9.5/10

The film that started a Trilogy, which created the blueprint that every trilogy in the future will be based upon.  

A Franchise that will change the industry forever.  

A Saga that will influence and inspire generations to come."
The one that started it all!
"One of the best movies of all time. Star wars a new hope is the ultimate story between good and evil, set in a galaxy far far away."
Beginning of the greatest movie saga.
"VHS: great movie, no other star wars film is better then it
DVD: absolutely awful. those added shots were not needed"
"The film is considered epic because of the time in which it was released. The characters are largely underdeveloped, the plot is quite linear, and viewer is told to support the rebellion through perspective-taking rather than given legitimate reasons. It is a mediocre film."
Wonderful Star Wars movie.
"The classic, the best star wars, don't think any other film will beat it."
"The movie that defined the space opera, Star Wars exploded its way into cultural significance. I honestly cannot find any faults with this film. It has a clear definition of the battle between the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire and the Empire's purpose of control is well-established. The characters all undergo significant development. Luke goes from this whiny farm boy to the savior of the Rebel Alliance, Han Solo goes from a greedy smuggler to being an integral part of the final battle. This movie will always be remembered as a masterpiece. The Battle of Yavin is spectacular, the music is phenomenal, the characters are all significant, and the idea of Jedi Knights using the Force leaves you wanting to know more."
"I finally watched Star Wars for the first time! I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if it wasn't so dated. None the less, the plot was enjoyable and the music was truly epic"
"I realize Star Wars is a cinematic juggernaut, but seeing it for the first time after nearly 40 years since its release definitely made it feel dated, no matter how badly I resisted the comparison to current acting chops and cinematography. Still, I'm committed to viewing the entire collection, and I'm well aware that this feeling will subside with each successive installment."
An epic intergalactic masterpiece but lagging
"'Star Wars' is the original summer blockbuster. It is a timeless classic and one of the most influential films ever made. From start to finish it takes viewers on an outrageously fun ride and completely immerses them into its fascinating universe. No other sci-fi film has ever given such an alluring mythology to go along with such instantly lovable characters. The visual and sound effects are easily the greatest for its time, and revolutionised the way films are made. John Williams' unforgettable score is perhaps the most recognizable theme music to ever accompany a film. Credit is also due to an antagonist who became one of the most iconic villains in movie history and simply demands attention whenever he is on screen. Ultimately, the film started a worldwide phenomenon, but still stands on its own as a fantastic singular experience."
"A fantastically original sci-fi adventure film that thrills, exhibits extraordinary practical effects and absolutely captures imaginations. Arguably worthy of the inevitable six dozen sequels to come."
"A fantastically original sci-fi adventure film that

"The First Step into a Larger World

George Lucas's epic 1977 blockbuster started off my favourite movie franchise of all time. Groundbreaking special effects made a great story, starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and the late Carrie Fisher, come to life, launching arguably the most popular movie series in the world.

The story is simple. A farm boy stuck on a desert planet meets two robots and an old wizard. They get a holographic message for help from a princess located in one of the robots. They embark on a mission to save her. In their adventure, they link up with a scruffy space smuggler and his furry friend to help them leave the desert world. In space they encounter a huge battle station that can destroy planets with a superlaser. On the battle station, they find the princess and rescue her. However an evil figure in black cuts down the old wizard. The others escape and join the rebellion against the evil empire that built the battle station. The farm boy becomes a pilot in the rebellion. In the fight to destroy the battle station, the evil figure in black tries to shoot down the farm boy, but fails because the smuggler fires and hits him at the last moment and sends him spinning into space. Then, using a mystical power, urged on by the ghost of the deceased wizard, the farm boy destroys the battle station. In the end, the two become heroes and are awarded medals.

The best thing about Star Wars is the characters. My favourite character in this movie is Han Solo, the space smuggler/scoundrel, played by Harrison Ford. He has the best personality - he is selfish, funny and charming as well as brave and smart. Mark Hamill as Luke the farm boy turned hero is great but also can sound whiney. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia is both charming and independent. She picks up a blaster and joins in the fighting which is rare for most damsels in distress. Alec Guinness as the Jedi wizard Obi Wan Kenobi is wise, full of surprises and confident in his opinions and in his mission. The side characters, R2-D2 and C-3PO, the robots, and Chewbacca, the Wookiee, are fun to watch and add comic relief to the story. Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones, is ruthless, evil and the killer of Obi Wan who was his Jedi teacher many years before. The late Peter Cushing, the former star of Hammer horror movies, plays his partner on the Death Star, Grand Moff Tarkin.

But the real star of this movie and the franchise itself is George Lucas. It is his vision and ideas that created this amazing film and film series. This heroic story is made possible by breakthrough special effects. Making Star Wars with his own passion and determination, Lucas is largely responsible for creating this movie. A large crew of specialist technicians who became Industrial Light and Magic - the teams that revolutionized special effects and digital filmmaking, supports Lucas.

It's not entirely perfect. Some of the special effects, especially in the end battle sequence don't hold up too well to today's standards. Lucas improved these in later releases. His tinkering with these movies, starting in 1997, however took away certain elements from the original and added ones that didn't make sense, such as the bounty hunter Greedo shooting before Han in a crucial scene for the smuggler's character. Some of the new effects like the CGI Jabba the Hutt (who we didn't see until the 3rd installment in the franchise) looked bad. Some of the lines in the script, especially lines from Luke and Obi Wan are sometimes weird and unrealistic. But these are small quibbles.

I starting watching Star Wars movies when I was 9 years old, and I can see myself enjoying these movies for the rest of my life. For any film fan, this film launched a franchise that is crucial to watch."
"Strengths: The sheer spectacle of this is enough to make it a recommend. This movie was groundbreaking and did so much for the genre. It worked so well for a lot of reasons. On one hand, the movie caters to almost everyone. There are characters who resonate with everyone. Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) isn't wowing anyone with his acting, but he does well enough. He plays the plucky good guy well enough that it lines up perfectly next to Harrison Ford (Han Solo). He debuts the iconic badass cool guy character. Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) is solid and Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi) shines as the mentor. It may be the best performance of the movie. The script doesn't try to be too much. It's a simple story of good vs. evil and that's when Star Wars usually works best. There are clearly defined roles and everyone plays their part well. Darth Vader is introduced as such a serious threat of an antagonist. His presence looms over the film in the best possible way. Obviously, John Williams delivers a fantastic score as he always does for this franchise. This movie benefits from some very good special effects. Some of the stuff looks better than movies I've seen in recent years. There is some great stuff in terms of cinematography, set design, makeup, and costume design, among others.

Weaknesses: As noted, while the performances are adequate, most of the cast isn't doing great work. George Lucas had great ideas here, but he's not an acclaimed director. You can tell he wasn't getting the best out of his actors. The Blu-Ray set that I watched this from is an updated one. That means it has instances where Lucas made changes and most are terrible. There's a scene where a really cheap looking Jabba the Hutt talks to Han and it's so bad, you're taken out of the movie.

Overall: A legendary movie that started a billion dollar franchise. It tells a simple story in the coolest of ways and introduces some iconic characters. A must-watch."
An amazing timeless revolutionary classic and everyting about it is so perfect. If there is one tiny little nitpick is that some of te acting does not old up and very little dialogue can be weird but tat is just stupid thing to nitpick about and it d'ont even care about it.
Very close to perfect
"George Lucas accomplished the greatest achievement in cinema ever. He has made a film that generations of people have loved and I am one of those people. Star Wars (Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope) contains everything that everyone would love in a film from its great characters to the emotional story and it is definitely one of the best films of all time and one of the most perfect movies ever made.

"While A New Hope revitalized sci-fi in cinema, it does have some flaws. I'm not saying the movie is bad; in fact it's one of the best in film history. However, it doesn't go very high up the Star Wars movie ratings. The story is well driven and the characters are perfectly round and suitable for the plot. The typical underdog vs favorites plot rolls out as a rather unique on because of the sci-fi genre. The sets, compared to its time, are wonderful. The effects still sometimes felt fresh even to this day, which shows how revolutionary A New Hope was. The final battle is one of the best final sequences ever, possible the best in Star Wars history; there's suspense, action, pace, and everything to present you a powerful finish for the movie. Speaking cons, the movie suffers some issues in dialogue, and more noticeably in the first act, which feels lost, boring, and at times irrelevant. But it is understandable why people were amazed by every shot of a movie that came out in 1977, when all people had were movies about desert shootouts and police car chases."
"Star Wars changed EVERYTHING: movie-making, special effects, adventure films, science-fiction and pop-culture in general."
I would've killed myself if this movie didn't exist. So much joy in my life come from the Star Universe. I can't explain it and I'm not ashamed. I fucking love Star Wars. Live long and prosper.
One of the best movies I've ever saw.
WOW! Who knew making a original movie was good?
"A classic and original sci-fi film to be enjoyed by families all around the world! Amazing characters, classic plot, and stunning character development, you can't ask for more!"
A quirky film with amazing sets and an organic narrative with mythic galactic overtones make this scifi/fantasy adventure film an instant classic worth multiple viewings.

My favourite movie - and it should be everyone else's
George Lucas kicks off one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time with this thrilling movie.
"Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope) is a 1977 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas.
This American epic space opera film, the original Star Wars and is one of the best. It contains amazing effects, unforgettable characters, and a mix of action and humour. Considered one of the best movies of all time, the second best science fiction movie of all time, and containing the best film musical score of all time. My favourite film of 1977. 
AAN GGND 1001"
"(97/100)
The Original Trilogy..."
"Rating based on Theatrical release, not the mangled Special Edition."
DUH DUH DUH it was THE #1 BAD FILM OF THE CENTURY AT LEAST I THINK SO
I enjoyed the fourth it lacks in action but in the third act its a fantastic film
"With an epic plot and music that is beyond spectacular, this movie is a must see for anyone who loves action and adventure with a story that will make you watch every film with the Star Wars brand on it that you can physically handle! This is and will always be a classic! This is truly a movie that will never be forgotten!"
"This movie changed the game for cinema, it's one of the greatest sci-fi films in the world, if not the best."
"In retrospect its hard to believe that this is the film that changed cinema forever, but Im sure at the time a giant planet-destroying disco-ball was incredible. But its certainly light-years ahead of the prequel series in terms of substance, and that makes it infinitely more engaging. The characters are more interesting because they're flawed, the relationships arent strictly formulaic, and it made liking the bad guy mainstream."
One of the most magical films of all time that continues to inspire people of all generations.
The beginning of LEGEND!
"Simply one of the best and most influential films of all time. Star Wars takes the traditional ""Good vs. Evil"" plot and blows it up onto a huge Sci-Fi level. It has been 40 years, and even without all the Special Edition changes, the practical effects look near flawless. Star Wars is a legendary achievement in storytelling, special effects, and most importantly, blockbuster filmmaking."
The best movie ever.
Second best Star Wars movie after Empire
"Wow.  The Last Jedi is coming out in December.  ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" was created by George Lucas.  George Lucas.  This movie has a few flaws, but it's no big deal.  This movie makes me break down mentally, it's so good.  The first scene tells you a lot: the Galactic Empire has a tight grip over the Rebel Alliance. Everything about this movie is great, with, again, only a few flaws.  It is still to this day one of my most favorite movies."
"I believe that the first time I saw ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"", I was around five or six years old, sitting in my cousin's basement. Eleven years later, I still get that sense of wonder, excitement and pure nostalgia, every time I watch it. Probably my most beloved movie of all time, and the fact that it was meant as just a one-shot, solo film instead of an extensive, creativity-filled franchise just makes it all the better. A movie that truly improves the older it gets."
"The first film in one of the most iconic film franchises of all time, ""A New Hope"" continues to hold up decades after its premiere with easily recognizable characters and stunning special effects."
Not much to say here! Gorgeous cinema.
Star wars is a classic. A new hope started all of these. It is one of the best  films of time especially if you consider that it was made back in 1977 this movie is simply amazing. If you don't like it then you most likely don't know about movies.
"Simply a masterpiece.

Score: 10/10"
A timeless classic film that holds up incredibly well.
"The film's writer/director; George Lucas, was inspired by several classic sci-fi movies and certain works of mythology. The intentions for the science fiction space opera was to present a visible portrait of good versus evil. There are many fans of this movie. It broke numerous of box-office records and change the way films would be shown. The downside of this series is that it created the rise of CGI, something that many fans have lacked because of its' prequels. The characters in the film are enjoyable to watch, as well as its' special visual Effects. Definitely a favorite!
Score: A+ GREAT!!!"
"The beginning from everything, Star Wars became one of the franchises which grew a pop culture along with a wide community. A New Hope, for now, is one of the all times classic sci-fi movies which is always memorable in our true heart. With a premise that seems simple about heroes who want to rescue a princess, this movie is one of the shadows and have never been forgotten because of the various characters. A deep universe always makes viewers ask what is huger than this. With all the memorable scenes, memorable characters, and memorable soundtrack thanks to John Williams, George Lucas' Star Wars is a world full of imagination in it."
Star Wars a new hope was not my favorite there was like no light saber battles and not a whole lot of action. But now there is a character in the movie named Luke Skywalker he is going to learn the ways of the force and become a Jedi. Luck has to figure out how he can destroy the death Star will he be able to do it time to find out.
storm trooper aim is priceless. it will forever be remembered
The beginning movie to my favorite movie trilogy is a masterpiece and expertly written and directed by George Lucas. The special affects is like nothing seen before the movie came out in 1977 and is a must watch for everyone!
"Of course 5 stars!  MORE than 5 stars as there never has been and never will be anything like Star Wars!  It's the most groundbreaking, astounding and original sci-fi movie to date and will hold it's  place in movie history forever and far above Avatar, Lord of the Rings, and Star Trek - all movies which I love.  Before the days of Star Wars, who had ever experienced the likes of Darth Vadar! the FORCE! C3PO! R2D2! Storm Troopers! Imperial Walkers! right!! Not to mention the music and incredible groundbreaking sound effects of the spaceships, light sabers and R2D2. Talk about creating an alternate reality where the eternal struggle between good and evil was so masterfully played out.  The bonds of love, loyalty and friendship between Luke, Leah and Hans is remarkable in the writing, directing and portrayal. The critical component of chemistry and the humorous exchanges between the 3 characters is something that Avatar and Lord of the Rings were missing.  Though I must say that Star Trek nailed it in that arena with the relationship between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. But back to Star Wars - the evil character of the emperor was seductive and palpable, spot on in casting and portrayal.  Even the droids R2D2 and C3PO, had wonderful, original personalities! The movie is just genius on all levels.  It had me awestruck and mesmerized from the opening scene of the massive battle cruiser's underbelly flying OVER us.  George Lucas, you have a gift and you are a gift!  Thank you for sharing it with us!"
I love this movie but it left a HUGE plot hole good anyway
One of the best space adventure films of all time!!!
"Star Wars: A New Hope is a very fresh start to one of, if not, the best franchise of all time. It is timeless, and set up the scene for a new galaxy far far away!"
This Movie captivated audiences all over the world.  Time Magazine gave it a great showing.  I remember waiting in line for over 2 Hours just to see this movie! Thus the *5* star rating!
"Probably the most Influential Film of all time, the film that inspired books,  tv shows, video games etc. Star Wars is everything you could want in a film, Fun, great entertainment, lovable characters good story and brilliant special effects that changed film forever. The thing that I loved most about this film is that it literally gets better and better as the movie goes on with every scene, now that's great storytelling. the characters are good and fun to watch especially Harrison Ford as a cocky smuggler Han solo, Mark Hamill was also ok as a Whiny Luke Skywalker and Late.Carrie Fisher was a good choice for playing Princess Leia, I'll expand more on the characters when I review Empire Stikes Back because I thought the acting was on and off from them in this film but was 10 times better in the Sequel. Darth Vader was a great villian and might even be the Greatest Villain of all time. Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan Kenobi was a great character and I loved his relationship with luke skywalker and how he was teaching him about the Force, Jedi etc. a few nitpicky stuff, the lightsaber duel was poorly constructed and had no weight to it, the acting wasn't that great and I never really clicked with C3po for some reason but ironically I loved R2-D2. Before I forget I also loved the space battle stuff especially the thrilling climatic ending with the death star getting destroyed that scene still holds up to this day. To sum up this film eventhough it has its flaws it's still a brilliant film that still stands the test of time, Extraordinary special effects, excitingly Entertaining and just all around FUN!!!!!"
"This and 'Jaws' will be known as the original movie blockbusters.

You HAD to see both of this in theaters opening weekend when it came out if you wanted to have any friends, or any chance of getting invited to parties.  This will go down as one of the greatest movies ever. When you think movies you think Star Wars. George Lucas created an iconic franchise, and revolutionized storytelling.

Cinematic Masterpiece
When I was a kid this film was like seeing magic for the first time.
"Hablar de esta película es muy difícil; si, está película tienen fallos y huecos argumentales como: por que han le debe dinero a Jabba y de echo podemos hacernos la pregunta ¿Es realmente tan buena como todos dice? Y no es por nada pero la trama, la típica trama del bien contra el mal, pero está película están grande que ¿A quien demonios le importa sus errores? Y es que star wars no es grande por su historia, lo que hace grande a star wars son sus increíbles efectos especiales para la época, la dirección de fotografía y sobretodo sus increíbles Personajes tan bien desarrollados que envidio a las personas que en su tiempo vieron está y la demás trilogía en las salas del cine y gracias a la mente de George Lucas nació lo que practimente es el primer Blockbuster."
"The start of a great movie franchise and it's just about everything you would expect from a great Star Wars movie: action, romance, drama, and fantasy."
Only the most epic movie of all time
"It's impossible to express in a mini-review how much I enjoyed watching Star Wars IV. A spectacular film that will never lose appeal! And yes, I'm putting off the prequels until I've watched the decent three. Star Wars, needless to say, is a classic. It's spectacular. Star Wars is one of the most engrossing films of all time; testament to the world that George Lucas managed to create and execute on screen. The SFX in Star Wars hold up amazingly well. Everything looks realistic - meaning the story is taken seriously through the entertainment. Star Wars introduces some of the most iconic characters in cinematic history, and it does so flawlessly. All performances are wonderful. I can't revel about Star Wars enough; there aren't enough adjectives in the dictionary. It'll be watched & adored by audiences forever."
A very good movie I love it and will always be amazing
"Star wars from beginning to end is an experience like no other.The Effects,Characters,Story,Music,acting,script,are all genius.You identify with Luke on his journey,You love Han solo because he is swag and cool,You Quote Obi wan because he is wise and thoughtful,Girls look up to Leia as a strong young women,You laugh at C-3PO and R2-D2 because there funny,You feel intimated by Vader because he has a commanding presence,You hum the Binary Sunset theme because it's catchy,and you have fun to watch this movie because it is a legend."
"The God father of science fiction film. The holy grail of cinema and the one that started it all. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan this movie is a must. No other film in history has managed to be as original or captivate the imagination of millions around the world. You can barely watch any TV show or movie today without some sort of reference to Star Wars. A true triumph in film making and in storytelling. It still holds up today 40 years after it was made which is a true testament of how good it is. A perfect blend of adventure, love, comedy and action all put together in a motion picture that will steal your hearts. 

And if your one of the people who does not like it then thats OK. But, if you consider yourself a film lover, then this milestone is a must."
This is the 3rd best star wars movie I have ever seen
This is a outstanding movie. This is a great introduction to our beloved franchise. This is a George Lucas masterpiece.
"A perfect introduction into the world phenomenon it soon became. Fun, entertaining, emotional, and thrill inducing! Star Wars is a triumph of film making and a classic that will live on through the ages."
"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...... With excitement!!!!!! Best movie of all time and my favourite character is Darth Vader."
"Almost gave it 4.5 as I think Empire is better, but this one changed everything in ways that no other film has, either before or since."
An epic movie and experience. GREAT!!
One of the best movies ever made.
Do I even need to write a review...cmon now
"A great movie to kick start the entire Star Wars saga. I will admit that the effects do look dated and the acting could have used a little more work, but A New Hope is still one of the most standout movies in the history of cinema."
Lightsaber battle was amazing so was the ending instant classic
The thing that STARted these amazing WARS get what I did there
"Visually breathtaking and groundbreaking, storywise intriguing and exciting, A New Hope nails every aspect a sci-fi blockbuster (and other movies) should."
One of the most overhyped films of all time. This film has aged horribly since 1977 and has turned into one the worst films of all time.
A classic that everyone needs to see.
A classic sci-fi film of the late 70's that will satisfy anyone who likes a little action mixed with a dramatic storyline and amazing special effects (Special Edition DVD not included).
"A classic, fun, and spectacular movie."
"What can I say....Star Wars Episode IV a New Hope, paved the way for everything to come after it.  Groundbreaking on every level.  Is it the best Star Wars movie, no, but as I said, it started everything."
"I remember walking out of this movie in 1977, and we were all just smiling."
"Great visuals for its time, interesting characters and story. Has some mystery to it.

9.1/10"
There's a New Hope of the Jedi. Awesome! :)
The one that started it all. A New Hope is important sci-fi and a classic story that lives on today.
Stay away from the prequels !
"It was a great start for the greatest trilogy of all time. I loved the suspense, space action, and drama. The beginning of the force."
"I cannot deny the influence 'A New Hope' had on sci-fi/fantasy and film in general. But lets face it, as a standalone movie, 'A New Hope' isn't very good. Our protagonist, Luke Skywalker, comes across as a whiny self-centered brat but I guess that's what it takes to be a Jedi Knight. Its a shame Lucas made the trilogy revolve around Luke because there are so many other more interesting protagonists. Such as Princess Leia, Han Solo, even the droids etc. Imagine if Leia was the chosen one. She could have been a much more fascinating and entertaining main protagonist; with her intelligence and snarky attitude it would have been a blast to see her go toe to toe with Vader. Re-watching this movie makes me realize how much Sir Alec Guinness is phoning in his performance as Obi-Wan. Subsequent interviews with him have shown that he has disdain for Star Wars. But even with all these flaws, at least 'A New Hope' set the stage for better movies to come."
"A define movie classic. This truly belongs in the long line of landmark Hollywood films next to Ben Hur and Psycho. Disney, please preserve movie history, and release the original trilogy on bluray as it was originally theatrically released!"
"That one moment when you realize you found time to watch and review The Force Awakens and Rogue One but never bothered to review the other Star Wars movies. Well, that changes today. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is an unforgettable sci-fi adventure. The film not only had a large impact on cinema during a time when films were small, independent beings with the film being a cultural phenomenon but it also has tons of good things. The performances, George Lucas' direction, the action sequences among them the remarkable Death Star fight located within the third act and the writing were great. All of them. The film even has tons of quotable lines such as: ""I sense a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices cried out and were suddenly silenced"",""I find your lack of faith disturbing"",""You may fire when ready"", ""Great, kid, don't get cocky"" and more. Another thing worth praising is John Williams' score. I don't often praise conducted music in films but when I do, it shows signs that the film has good in it. Had it not been for this movie, we wouldn't have the big-budget blockbuster Hollywood offerings we have now. And it's all thanks to you, George Lucas. You may have been accused of ruining your own franchise with the prequel trilogy but you still get credit for opening our eyes to how, in blockbuster filmmaking, there are infinite possibilities."
"Ah, the one that started it all. Star Wars is a fantastic film that pioneered the expansion and popularity of the sci-fi genre, and it is a marvel of a film in every single aspect. The classic that continues to stand against the test of time."
"The original sci-fi epic. Lots of great action, interesting characters and a fast pace."
Wow!! Best Star Wars sequel yet after the original three!!!! Great continuation of the next generation.
This was not my favorite Star Wars a new hope I like the new Star Wars better. And in this one I just don't think there was a whole lot of light saber fighting. I like Obie wan fighting Darth Vader
One of the best films ever made. Revolutionized what filmmakers could do with CGI.
"No movie has affected my life such as this one. I remember the first time it was shown on TV. I recorded it on VHS, and watched it every day for a week. Critically speaking, no it is not the ""best"" of the series, but it will always be my favorite movie of all time. And I am so thankful I still have the original versions to watch. Every one of Lucas's ""improvements"" have weakened it, and I feel sorry for the children of this century, who will never see a great movie the way it was meant to be seen."
"BEST SCI-FI EVER!!!!!!!!!!!

The Movie That Changed The World 
Amazing Visuals of That Time,Memorable Legendary Characters And Very Much More
But The Only Problem is Corny And Cheesy Dialouge
Still It Is Best Sci-fi Movie Ever"
"My Re-Edit of STAR WARS removed many of the BLANK WHITE SCREENS that flash before your eyes, and yet, contain no actual content from the movie,"
"Simply one of the most important movies of all time! Right after Spielberg's ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"" had redefined the concept of blockbuster movies forever! John Williams' score is just perfect and the characters were perfectly set up for the rest of the future franchise, obviously without knowing the franchise would eventually advance!"
"Packed with exicting characters and action sequences, Star Wars A new hope is a classic of science-fiction and cinema in general."
All I'm gonna say is there's a reason this film is so iconic and has spawned an entire franchise.
"Extremely good, but more boring than you remember. But it's still very cool to watch. The original Star Wars movie is really good. Good to see."
Great acting and visuals. Timeless.
"One of the best experiences I've had with cinema.
Not only is it visually great even in these times, but it works as an introduction to a huge universe that has been expanding over the years.
A totally enjoyable, artistic and exciting film."
"This movie was awesome. Not as much action as The Empire Strikes Back, but better dialogue."
"A classic that put the spark to so many generations of future films, not only Star Wars. An entertaining film that goes full speed ahead with it's space fantasy adventure and never hits the breaks."
"Not as good as the original.
Someone should remake this remake and call it ""the Force Awakens"""
"A great start into the world of these characters. Introducing the mythos of Jedi and Sith to the world in such a fun and fascinating way. Luke, Leah, and Han are all lovable characters that you gladly root for. Darth Vader is terrifying and no one should cross him, or else. I thoroughly enjoy every part of this film. A must see no doubt."
"That's no moon, that's a space station.
Help me Obewan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
Will someone please get this walking carpet out of my way.
Waa Hoo! Okay kid now let's blow this thing and go home!
Don't call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease.
Aren't you a bit short for a storm trooper?
Maybe its another drill.
I don't like you either. You'd better watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on 12 systems."
This was a true classic for the time.
A great film that introduced us to many classic characters.
"With the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi impending, I will try to review every Star Wars film in order of release date. And it starts with Star Wars, or A New Hope, or however you'd like to call it, one of the greatest films of all time and one of my all time favorites. Ah, Star Wars. The classic tale of good versus evil. From it's famous opening crawl, to it's triumphant royal ceremony, Star Wars is a classic film that still generates conversation today. The story tells the tale of Luke Skywalker, a farmer who aspires to be a pilot, who teams up with two droids and a wise old Jedi named Ben Kenobi, and a smuggler named Han Solo, to rescue Princess Leia from the evil Darth Vader. The opening scene tells you all you need to know. The Empire dwarfs the Rebellion. It is then we are introduced to my favorite female character in film history, Princess Leia, and the most intimidating villain of all time, Darth Vader. On Tatooine, Luke Skywalker aspires to leave his family and fly off the planet, as shown in the iconic twin suns scene. Every scene in this Sci-Fi classic is so meticulously crafted. There are scenes of pure suspense and excitement, shown excellently in the trash compacter and trench run sequences. This movie came out in 1977, and yet the special effects are timeless. Unlike the poorly aged CGI of the prequels, the use of practical effects due to of course, technical limitations, makes every Sci-Fi concept seem real. The influence of George Lucas' classic was unprecedented, and it introduced us to likeable characters, and ended in a way that was open to more. Rating: A+"
Good film especially the ending
One of the best Star Wars movies. Totally love this legend!
"The original classic, It still great.  It doesn't hold up as well as Empire or Jedi, but it is still one of the greatest flicks of all time.  The ultimate galactic adventure!"
A masterpiece of film history.
A great movie which was revolutionary to the movie world and this movie leaves no doubt of its cinematic brilliance .
"This movie is great. It has great characters and amazing CGI for its time that still holds up very well to this day. Although it has a pretty basic story where a the hero has to save the princess, it doesn't stop this movie from being great and being an all time classic. If you somehow haven't watched it, watch it... what are you doing with your life?"
"Star Wars one of Most Successful- blockbuster Film Direct By George Lucas, 
 this is take Long time ago In the Galaxy far far away... By 1977 George Lucas bought Film for Indication for one step up film for audience clear him he one Mastermind of sci-fi saga, and my know l know star wars ever least my age. well maybe 7. okay You know l see star wars as this dvd came out and l thought it stupid Princess and Guy Swept suit even wear Gas Helmet. And lm not  even Hate Star wars. for all here lm talking to an that it what lm start it. the thing l don't know what star wars is all about,? you know the Jedi Force. The movie took Hundred of year, Princess Leia Cast by Carrie fisher who Queen of Republic Rebel Alliance who been attack by  Darth Vader kidnapped Leia sending signal Recording Cute Robot R2-D2 and C3-PO To be Continued.."
"Sebuah eksekusi yang sangat tepat. ""STAR WARS"" merupakan sebuah kombinasi cerita yang menghasilkan sebuah masterpiece yang tidak ternilai. ... Fantastis!"
"A fantastic and extremely innovative film that no one can forget. Star Wars Ep. IV is no doubt a classic. Every time I watch this movie I feel a combination of emotions, from sadness to suspense. It's like the perfect movie template for others to get inspired and work with. There are obvious western and samari connections, but the fact is that this movie combines them. This combination is astounding. It leaves an amazing action-packed impression. My only complaint is that the characters in the entire trilogy in fact, seem to like emotion in their dialogue, especially when Luke encounters the death of his guardians. But some now say that this may have been intentional due to the Jedi code."
"This film changed the history of cinema, and I'm not talking about the office, I'm talking about film in general. The special effects were revolutionary and still hold up today. The story is very entertaining with very well fleshed out characters, and many great and memorable moments. The acting is good, the action is amazing and entertaining, and the overall product managed to captivate millions in a very good way."
All the original Star Wars films get a 3.5/5 from me. Pure popcorn entertainment. There is a place for that. :) The first two Prequels get 2.5 and Episode III gets 3/5 from me.
"What's better than a young Jedi knight saving a princess from an evil heavy-breathing Sith Lord?  Also, C-P3O and R2-D2 are a great duo.  Oh, and Han Solo, my favorite Star Wars character, was played well by Harrison Ford."
Childhood movie. Memorable cast and overflowing with creativity. Extremely ahead of it's time and holds up great today.
Excellent movie. Worth watching over and over again.
Classic. Slightly outdated but still incredibly entertaining. Cinematography amazing for the time.
"'That's great kid! don't get cocky.'

The lightsaber spark that ignited 'Franchise Cinema' as we know it. It's success is mainly because it gives the audience something it has seen before disguised as Sci-fi - a familiar story set in a then unfamiliar landscape. Its dialogue is clunky, some of its creatures look like they were made accidentally in a skip but somehow there is so much memorale stuff here. iconic themes, scenes and characters that basically changed Hollywood. it endures and ensures 

'the force will be with you... always.'"
"Star Wars: A New Hope was undoubtedly a rough start for the saga - with a poor script, poor effects, and poor acting. However, a few scenes from the movie make up in part for the negatives to the movie."
nothing to add *great movie
Probably the most classic movie of all time!
perfection...and it's not even the best in the series
This is where it all began. It is a great Star Wars movie and is loved by all! This is a great movie!
"It was entertaining. Unfortunately, it does feel dated. But the story was good and it was fun to follow the characters. The action scenes were expecting although not visually the greatest."
"I can't really put into words what this movie means to me.  I watch it once a year, and I'm always in awe of the spectacle it was in 1977.  The writing is perfect.  The sets are believable.  The acting is brave and funny.  This movie is ten years older than me, but it still feels modern and forward-thinking.  We miss you, Carrie Fisher."
"The movie that started it all, not to mention it still looks great in 2017. This movie started the most iconic and the best saga in all of history, even if there are some boring chapters. It is a must see, but that is not a problem because everyone has seen it."
"A cinema legend. It's an interesting movie, and while not being the best or most action packed movie in existence, it's a great little movie that began a saga we all love."
Great film! A truly entertaining film to start the Star Wars franchise.
What would've been an ambitious attempt on bringing in stories and inspirations to make this movie. But George Lucas turned this movie into a blockbuster sensation.
I remember waiting in line when I was a kid. Best movie I've ever seen to this day!!
"I can't remember seeing this film for the first time, but after watching it years later, I instantly got why so many people loved it. It's fun, fast-paced, it has good characters that are constantly on the run or struggling to survive in battle. There's rarely a dull moment, and the slower scenes are dedicated to either build-up, character development, or giving some backstory details. The build-up always pays off, the characters are interesting, and what little of the backstory we're given is intriguing enough for us to want to know more. I can't really think of a flaw with this film, it just had a lot of time and proper thought put into as well as the right amount of effort and imagination to craft together a near-perfect movie! Can't think of a flaw, and I can't express how much I admire Lucas for crafting together something that feels so genuine and so large with the limited budget and resources that he had. He went through Hell doing it too, so this gets a nice 5 stars from me."
A masterpiece of scriptwriting and directing capped off by daring performances by all actors involved.
"The dialogue may be kind of stupid (typical George Lucas), but the action scenes, visual effects, and most of the characters (simplistic as they may be) really make up for that. A fantastic start to one of the biggest film franchises of all-time."
"If not for Lucas' prowess as a scholar of the classics, this movie would have been nothing more than a self-gratifying million dollar emulation of sci-fi serial Flash Gordon. The same could be said about any other influence and inspiration which makes this movie like a perfect omelette with the right amount of camp, science fiction, opera, and classical storytelling. Adventure whisks its titular protagonist Luke Skywalker from home to meet his destiny. Nothing really stands in his way as he goes from farmer to pilot and then to savior of the galaxy in one fell swoop, but the journey is exciting; imprinting itself as one of the greatest stories ever told which has rightly earned the status of modernistic myth Lucas was trying so hard to accomplish."
"The one that started it all, while the special effects and action sequences captivate viewers even 40 years later, it really shines because of the grand spectacle at the heart of it all. ANH manages to get us invested in the characters, captivated at the possibilities of the Star Wars universe, all the while not taking itself quite too seriously, resulting in brilliant entertainment."
"Amazing heroes, villians and a legendary story"
Fantastic way to start the franchise and is extremely enjoyable after watching Rogue One ð???
"While its slow-burn pacing may make it difficult for a modern audience to appreciate, and the technical limitations are glaring to a world spoiled on amazing visual effects, Episode IV is still an undeniably great piece of cinematic storytelling.

The first true blockbuster, this movie opened the gates for a new generation of filmmaking, and will forever (and much-deservedly) be cemented in history as a classic."
Definitely deserves a higher rating then 4.1 folks. Your seriously rating TFA over this? Call a professional and get help!
"It's fucking star wars. 
The reel deal"
This one was great a lot of Action
"Star Wars a new hope is really great, it was so great it was considered the death of cinema. This movie is perfect the way it is."
"A masterpiece only rivaled by The Force Awakens, A New Hope is a fantastic movie that never ceases to hold my attention. Even though this wasn't my first Star Wars movie (the highly underrated The Phantom Menace was my first), this was the one that solidified my love for the franchise. The best entry in the series, next to The Force Awakens."
"It really sucks that you can no longer find the original edit for Star Wars or the ""Special Edition"" version in stores or online. Its probably the only reason I would go to the thrift store and buy a VCR so that I can watch the Special Edition again like I did when I was younger.

After watching it again recently, I think the first time you see Star Wars will always be the best. You'll be instantly swept off by the brilliant special effects, the action and adventure and the brilliant script-writing. 

After seeing it numerous times and comparing it to the other Star Wars films, however, you can easily notice where the film could have been better in terms of acting, story and transitions. 

What's truly amazing about this film is that George Lucas practically accomplished the impossible. He took an extremely low budget, some no-name actors and created the greatest franchise of all time! And once you've seen this film, you'll understand why!"
Great start to a legendary franchise with memorable characters and iconic scenes.
My favorite movie of all time!
"""Amazing direction, fantastic practical effects, and the soundtrack itself, each of those combined and you'll get an epic sci-fi beauty classic! George Lucas has brought us the original that will never get old! It'll get you to go, ""WOOOOO!"" from the explosions this film contained. The action sequences were phenomenal, the characters were top notch, and the story is pure genius."""
"When i first saw Star Wars when I was a little girl...I loved it! I mean loved it! Granted I had no idea about the freaking storyline for real. I just saw dreamy Luke and those blue eyes...fighting with laser..robots..flying in around in space..shit that was enough for me. I didn't even realize it was such a huge deal! I was born in 1976 I saw some time in the 80's!
 I did a rewatch. (as I do with a lot of films that people make a big deal out of). Mostly because I love sci-fi (i love most genres except romance right now) I see how crazy people go over star wars and then there are the trekkies..I want to know whats the pull...
 I watched this again. Understanding the real story line, of course the robots and stuff aren't as impressive now but honestly that is what makes some old movies great. I still liked it. I didn't remember the slow parts but I guess that is to be expected. I still liked it but I didn't love it.
 I am going to get around to the next one. For me that would Return of the Jedi. I want to see the new ones as well.."
A great sci-fi film in every way! CLASSIC!!
A wonderful story that started a new era in movie making.
"Still holds up. Wonderful in every aspect, nobody expected this movie would be as big as it as and is why more movie studios should take risks."
"Watching this nearly 40 years after its initial release, A New Hope holds up pretty nicely, and is still a worthwhile viewing. Harrison Ford also steals the show as the infamous Han Solo."
"Star Wars: A New Hope is the first movie in the Star Wars Franchise and is one of the best in the franchise! It's a great film, the story is a classic, the characters are perfect and so is the cast. Director/Creator George Lucas does a fabulous job with this movie. The musical score by John Williams is perfect and is also a classic."
"The world's best science fiction film.
Good animation, action, actors and special effects.
Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are doing the work of brilliance.
This movie is bound to bring a hat."
A New Hope is groundbreaking cinematic art that redefined the sci-Fi adventure genre while offering the best hero story of cinema history.
I recommend it to everyone except me
"Legendary, entertaining and clever - A New Hope starts the most epic and groundbreaking sci-fi/fantasy saga and expands the limits of blockbusters."
"The wonderfully epic opening menu crawl has become the most iconic way to start a movie, and for good reason: when pasted in front of the brilliant view of a galactic star field with a heroic musical anthem by John Williams, we feel more than just a part of this space serial, it appears as if this universe coexists with our own.

You don't always hear of a folklore told over and over in our modern day and age, but now the settings and extraterrestrial inhabitants, particularly the old wise mentor portrayed by Alec Guinness (The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia), evoke the calm feel of an old fable under a new identity in the limitless bounds of outer space. It is both a tribute to tales as old as time as well as a social critique on the fault of machines. A significant level of focus in this story is placed onto the droids, C-3PO and R2-D2, and how the strife of nuclear war affects their productivity, much like what America saw of the Cold War.

...Which makes this picture all the more spectacular: it compares and contrasts cultural reliance on faith versus technology in an innocent yet playful approach for children to not only understand, but commit their whole selves to. Teenagers will enjoy the richness of the main cast of players, including the underdog farm boy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the self-entitled smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Then finally, adults will enjoy Star Wars for its loving tribute to classic Hollywood genres of their time, including low-key westerns of the 1930s and big-scale epics of the 1950s."
"It's not sci-fi, fantasy, action, or even a classic. Star Wars (NOT ""New Hope"") is in a league of it's own. A legendary masterpiece."
"One of my favorite movies of all time, surpassed only by its sequel."
"It's good, but not great. I grew up with Star Wars like most people my age, but looking back now, it's pretty lame in a lot of ways. But, it's also remarkable in a lot of ways. I guess it's a mixed bag. I love the way the film is paced for the first 30 minutes or so. Something about the way Luke is introduced really tickled my fancy. I dunno, it's hard to say much about it given how much of a cultural landmark it is. It is what it is I guess."
"A movie that made my childhood, Star Wars has stood the test of time and will always be considered one of the best films ever made."
"Movie Review: Final
Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope
Everybody's just a kid from somewhere. Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope, starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher, brings drama and an amazing story into the sci-fi universe. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill,) a farm boy on a desert planet, wants to escape his boring home and live a life of adventure. He ends up meeting a jedi named Obi wan Kenobi and learns the ways of the force. The farmers he lives with get killed, so he leaves his home and joins the rebel alliance to fight the empire. Along the way they meet a criminal on the run named Han Solo (Harrison Ford,) who flies them to where they need to go to rescue the rebel leader Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher,) who takes them to the rebel base so they can come up with a plan to destroy the evil empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR. Each actor plays his/her part perfectly, and the movie has incredible special effects for the time, but the real genius is in the story. Star Wars is actually many different, wonderful stories in one movie (Luke's story, Han's story, Rebels vs. Empire, Obi wan's story, I could go on.) However, the movie starts the action right away, and has very few peaceful moments, which may not be for everybody. Overall, I give the movie 5/5 stars."
One of the best sci-fi movies ever.
"it was beter than the original,but it is still bad,I would rather watch transformers than watch this stupid movie for 4 year olds."
"I finally, finally watched this film. It was good, but I just did not experience that ""I have just watched one the greatest movies of all time"" feeling. It did not wow me. Hopefully, the other films in the series will be better."
The First Star Wars movie is an absolute beauty and a masterpiece.Loved it and I can't find any mistakes!
Great way to start the saga.
"this is my favorite movie of all time. the reason being is because it's the one that started it all. if we didn't have this movie, we wouldn't have the entire star wars trilogy. I remember seeing this film for the first time and I was blown away by every second of it. this is a perfect example of a perfect movie. the only nitpick about it is the scene where the storm trooper hits his head on the door and that was actually a very severe injury, that guy had to go to the hospital for that. over then that, it's a perfect movie.


Owens grade: A+"
One of the greatest films ever made in the 20th century! Thank you George for this masterpiece!
"Star Wars is a very inspiring film, full of original environments and memorable heroes and villains that everyone can relate to."
Simply amazing! No haters here! Way better than Star Trek!
"The film that started it all! Yes it was way before my time, but most can still the brilliance of a classic like this. Watching the biggest so far victory for the rebel alliance against the galactic empire is awesome. Great soundtrack, acting, plot and characters."
"This film is overrated, but still a great movie. The film has not aged particularly well, and the lack of light saber battles may make the film somewhat tiring, especially since it's by far the slowest entry in the entire series. 

That being said, the destruction of the death star is not only iconic, but remains one of the most thrilling moments in the history of cinema, and this movie introduced us to the characters that we all know and love. 

I recommend this movie to everyone."
"Star Wars begins the greatest cinematic achievement of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever created. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn fest, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history. My point here is that Star Wars is a classic even to people who don't know Pulp Fiction from Twilight. It has everything you could possibly want: action, romance, midgets, quotable dialogue, and a reminiscent score by John Williams. Star Wars is the definition of success."
(5/5) This has amazing effects for 1977 and I love it!
A timeless masterpiece. A New Hope cannot be reviewed but instead it must be watched.
Ok film. Really don’t get the fuss over the Star Wars films. Terrible scripts and cheesy characters.
The only movie i would ever say is perfect. The witty lines from han solo The menacing vader all clicks together for what is my favorite movie ever.
An interstellar launch of one of the best space operas ever made.
"To kick off perhaps the greatest movie franchise of all time, A New Hope also delivers a different way of telling fanatical stories that make the audiences want more. This movie, along with every other Star Wars movie (Yes. The Prequels too. And yes, I am biased) never get old after viewing them thousand upon thousands of times."
"A fantastic movie. A great cast, a great story, great characters, great direction, writing, props, effects, models, costumes. This movie is amazing in every way. You care about the characters, you care about what they're trying to do.  George Lucas creates a different galaxy and when watching this movie, you will feel like you are in this galaxy. And the movie is visually stunning. It's a shame that the Special Edition was released. That nearly ruined Star Wars."
"A film unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. This movie solidified Star Wars as a Hollywood franchise behemoth and the effect it had on the entire world will impact society for MANY generations to come. This film was completely original and captured the imaginations of millions by taking viewers into a world never before seen. It was risky, funny, action packed and you will truly never be able to say enough about it. Amazing."
"The Original Star Wars Film is a glorious cinematic masterpiece that forever changed the way we view and make films. The original Star Wars is flawless, fun, and thought provoking. It could be argued this is the greatest film ever made"
"The start of an amazing mythology, and the beginning of one of the most well known movie franchises of all time. This story tells the journey of how a young man gains knowledge of the universe he lives in, and becomes a force to be reckoned with. It is classic storytelling at it's finest. It may not have perfect dialogue, and the action is a bit weak for most of the film, but in the end, that is not at all what matters. The characters, the world, and the meaning behind everything is what really sticks out, and I love this film for that. A movie does not have to be perfect, to feel perfect. ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" is fantastic filmmaking and perfect storytelling!"
Great first film with an excellent score and impressive visuals for time. Purely great!
"Other than the really fast startup from Tatooine, I have nothing to complain about... well maybe the special editions."
The Most Overrated movie of all freaking time. It freaking sucks. BooooOOOooooOOoo
"This, in my opinion, is the best of the Star Wars films. The one that started it all. It may be dated, but the charm and sense of excitement is still as strong as ever before. Definitely worth it."
"It,s a good Star Wars movie"
one of the greatest movies ever
"A classic SciFi film that, along with Jaws, brought about the age of the summer blockbuster. George Lucas writes and directs an imaginative, captivating story, but doesn't seem to understand dialogue."
"From the plot to the music, from the love to the hope; this movie takes originality to the next level in a courageous adventure across the galaxy. This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time!!"
"A powerful balance between story and action, Star Wars expands upon all other imagination with jaw-dropping story and mystery."
"George Lucas's Presents one of the most Epic and Best films in cinematography history presenting its fast pacing,strong leading performances and characters,a deatj defying villian and revolutionary special effects make Star Wars a must watch for any age"
One of the greatest and important movies I ever seen
an amazing space adventure that has changed the movie industry
Star Wars episode 4 was a good film give the backstory episode 3 between the characters between Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke Skywalker.         how to adjust time was destroyed by  Luke Skywalker new  chapter will begin
"It was a long time ago in a galaxy not so far, far away but back in 1977 nobody knew what was about to happen. Imagine a world without Luke Skywalker, the Millennium Falcon or R2-D2? It seems as though almost everyone in the known universe has heard of the much loved Star Wars saga and this is where it all began. Since originally released, the movie has been tweaked and fluffed up with new effects and even new characters added but it remains one of the finest space opera science fiction adventures ever brought to the screen. The sheer vision and imagination of the creative teams that worked on every element of the movie shines through. Looking back on it now, from an era where CGI effects mean that all manner of fantastical vistas and situations can be created inside the gibbons of a machine, it seems incredible to think that the vast majority of the effects were created using models, costumes and prosthetics. It has a real feel and grittiness that the prequels too often lacked. The cast throw themselves into the action with gusto. For the most part, they look scarily young and fresh faced as indeed most of them were at the time. However added to the young leads, we have the genius of Alec Guinness and the delicate, yet menacing Peter Cushing. Both of these fine old British actors demonstrate their absolute skill as actors and use every gesture and nuance to make their characters work within the plot. The script here, whilst not always brilliant, isn't as clunky or cliche riddled as they became in later outings of the saga and there is none of the morass of stifling plotting that dogged the prequels. This is just non-stop fun and action where you can really cheer at the heroic antics and hiss at the bad guys. This movie spawned generations of geeks and fans who simply loved the escapism and fantasy of it all. We collected the figures, read the books, ate the cereal and slept under the Star Wars duvet covers and now, approaching our fifties, we can look back on this film and know that we were there. We queued up to get into the cinema to see it. We had light sabre fights in the playground and argued over whether Han was better than Luke. Most of all, however, we know full well, that these first three were the proper Star Wars films. The original and best. The later versions will never quite measure up and we don't mind telling everyone."
A great start to what will be known as the most popular movie franchise of all time.Good story and great characters its just slow at parts but still a very good film.
Classic.  'nuff said
One of the Greatest Movies of all Time!  Probably the most fun you'll ever have at the theater.
As if my review of this matters...
"This is me favourite of the original films, it was a great start. This is my 3rd favourite Star Wars"
Star Wars IV is the perfect beginning to the best movie trilogy ever made! I suggest this movie to anyone.
"First Star Wars I saw today I wish for a little more light saber action

But still awesome story"
"Star Wars is a visually stunning film with great performances and amazing action throughout. It has memorable characters like Luke, Han, R2D2, and of course Darth Vader. This film contains no dull moments, and has really no weaknesses to speak of. My favorite movie as a kid is still one of my favorites as an adult. Overall, the special effects are great and the story is excellent, which is why Star Wars is one of the best movies of all time."
A movie that revolutionized science fiction and all movies forever. Must see movie.
"Star Wars is not only a stunning piece of timeless storytelling, it is an important stamp in pop culture that forever changed the way film will be made."
"Star Wars has amazing characters, a great story, and loads of fun that make it a timeless classic."
Not bad... Just kidding it's prefect.
"The first Star Wars movie ever made by the one and only George Lucas, although he did come up with the idea of making the film.
Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Sir Alec Guinness."
"The movie that started ""it all."" George Lucas quite literally picked up a study by Carl Jung on literary archetypes and wrote the script to a ""T."" Wonderful cast interaction and great ""coming of age"" film. One of the best parts of the movie is how relatable the characters can be to just about everyone. Luke Skywalker is the farm boy that seeks bigger and better things, Han Solo is the average cocky guy but also has a soft spot for helping people. Wonderfully crafted film to lay ground work for the rest of the saga, starting with episode IV of course."
"Em 1977 ninguém esperava que o jovem George Lucas, através de uma amálgama de géneros (western, samurais, ficção cientifica...), fosse criar um dos filmes mais influentes da história do cinema. Os efeitos especiais práticos surpreenderam a audiência que, embalada pela icónica banda sonora de John Williams, deixou-se levar pela aventura acompanhada por personagens que ainda hoje ninguém esqueceu o nome e feitio. Podem dizer que o argumento é demasiado tradicional mas a verdade é que não existe outra propriedade intelectual que 40 anos depois, detém uma legião de fãs em constante crescimento e continua a afetar pessoas de todas as idades."
the best movie ever it's the best Star Wars is awesome thank you so much  for bringing it back
The first Star Wars movie has an outstanding story varied scenery and good characters however the action scenes are lacking
This movie is sooooo boring!
"The start of one of the most successful, exploitable, and popular, not only sci-fi franchise, but franchise of all time thanks to this film kicking off that franchise with one hell of a bang. Now the dialogue can be a bit wooden at some points, but that is made up by great performances, great action, and amazing special effects for then and now which makes it one of the most unforgettable masterpiece's ever made."
"The start to a legendary franchise, this builds the beginning of the Star Wars universe with just the right amount of cheese and an abundance of creative visuals and effects. The timeless characters and quotable dialogue make this a sci-fi classic."
"I was introduced to the entire franchise by my parents when we were living in Oahu, HI. At first, I wasn't too interested in the Original Trilogy until I saw the Prequel Trilogy. The Phantom Menace wasn't that engaging but Revenge of the Sith definitely was. As I continued to be a fan of the franchise as I grew up, I just binge watched these movies because they were my world. I'd always pretend to be a Jedi and have my own fantasies in the world of Star Wars. Episode IV, as well as it's sequels, are unique in every sense of the word. This is a film series I'm definitely gonna introduce to my future children."
One of the best films of 1977
"Star Wars is what cinema is all about. Creative work, originality, charm, memorable characters, and the truest form of art and entertainment. These films truly bring you to another world that resonates a feeling of familiarity. People and cultures from all edges of our world are brought together by these films, and with an impact that large, you just know that it's something special. 

Star Wars always had the cutting edge effects of its age and, to this day, still proves to be incredibly entertaining. I find myself many times just smiling throughout the film out of pure enjoyment as I get to witness timeless cinema.

After the first release of Star Wars, Mark Hamil, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fischer became icons over night. Even today when they were back on the big screen for The Force Awakens, they had the presence of legends. 

Star Wars is where imagination comes to life for not only children, but for adults as well. Star Wars is the reason for so many people to become involved with film, and this reason alone is one of many reason why Star Wars is one of the greatest films in of all time.

The production of the films is what I love the most to see in cinema. The practical effects of puppetry, modeling, painting, stop motion animation and countless other artistic talents are combined into each and every one of Star Wars' original trilogy. The reason why the newer Star Wars trilogy wasn't received as well is because those films lost all of the artistic talent that was put into the original trilogy.

Very few films are or ever will be like Star Wars. 

Star Wars: 5 stars
The Empire Strikes Back: 5 stars
Return of the Jedi: 4.5 Stars"
A thrilling experience that will live on till the end of time
"The one that started it all. It was mind blowing back in the 1970s to hear the music and see the special effects. Even though it's my least favorite Star Wars movie of the original trilogy, the impact it has on other sci fi movies continues to be seen today."
A great opening to in my opinion the best film franchise of all tie the original Star Wars saga
"Although it lacks good acting, Star Wars is still very exciting and visually amazing."
"Released in 1977, Star Wars (The Episode IV: A New Hope subtitle was added later) changed cinema forever by revolutionising and innovating what audiences would come to know as the modern movie blockbuster, a film which dominates the box office both in ticket sales and critical reception. It's been nearly forty years since the saga began, and it remains a masterclass in why we all go to the movies.

Over two decades have passed since the events of the prequel trilogy; the Jedi are all but exterminated and the Galactic Empire rules over the galaxy with the villainous Darth Vader as its iron fist. But this dictatorship has let critical plans regarding its ultimate weapon slip into the hands of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and as the film begins, it's clear that they must be delivered to the rebellion in a desperate bid to end the tyranny. The audience is dropped straight into the action involving a tense chase over an unknown planet between a puny cruiser and a massive star destroyer, which firmly grabs the audience from the offset. Another interesting thing about the plot is that it opens from the perspective of the two bumbling droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker); by having this outside look, the film almost has an element of discovery to it. Just as the droids are exploring Tatooine, so too is the greater universe gradually revealed to the audience. As an opening chapter, Star Wars does a fantastic job of introducing the audience to its world. Each character and setting enters the overall plot in a very natural and believable way. We see characters like Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) enter the fray and their detailed character arcs are placed front and centre over the course of the episode. With a combination of tense moments, thrilling action sequences and effective emotional moments, the film is quite literally a rollercoaster ride, rising and falling with such perfect pacing and gusto that you never take your eyes off of the proceedings; it's that compelling.

The characters are some of the most iconic in cinema for a reason in that they go through a specific arc. Luke Skywalker starts off as a lowly desert farmer, seemingly unwilling to get involved with matters greater than himself, but through the guidance of Obi-Wan Kenobi he begins to accept and embrace the first steps on path he takes towards becoming a Jedi. Obi Wan's wise and calm mannerisms are beautifully crafted by the performance of Alec Guinness, who typifies the older mentor character that has since become a fixture in other film franchises. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is just as engaging; he's a bit of an ass to in this film, only in on things based on the reward he'll get at the end. Yet despite this characteristic he's still incredibly charismatic and funny, the kind of likeable rogue who dives straight into the action like a bat out of hell. The final piece of the popular trio, Princess Leia, plays off Hamill and Ford for some humorous banter and makes her presence felt as a strong female character. As one of the best and most recognisable villains in cinema history, the combination of David Praus and James Earl Jones is a chilling mix for Darth Vader; the dark lord of the Sith is both imposing and calculating, demonstrating his power through his mastery of the force and his surprising skill in space combat.

Without the technology to render massive worlds and planets, the older special effects were accomplished on a closely knit and intimate level and they are still staggeringly creative in their execution. The animatronics on the creatures are vibrant and imaginative, along with the frankly gargantuan amount of props and models that were all transplanted into the film's cinematography. The practical effects coalesce seamlessly with the environments which made use of real world locations such as Tunisia and Guatemala for Tatooine and Yavin IV respectively. Often times though it's the little things which really allow the world to come alive; the strange serpentine skeleton C-3PO wanders by in the Tatooine desert, the many imaginative alien faces that populate the Mos Eisley cantina and the technology that fills the Imperial Death Star all contribute massively to the universe the film creates. You get the sense that more must exist beyond the first film and as a result you want to find other morsels about this galaxy far, far away, uncover its secrets and see just how deep it goes. That's one of the greatest things that Star Wars did; place its audience into its world and sparking their imaginations like no other science fiction series has. The forever recognisable soundtrack is distinctive in the way it shifts and alters depending on characters, setting and action; from the sweeping overture of the opening credits to the foreboding Death Star Motif, the work accomplished by composer John Williams piles constantly instils a feeling of awe in the viewer. The technical specs of the original Star Wars cannot be underestimated; the special effects employed are so immersive that they fully complement, rather than hinder the plot and characters.

The very first Star Wars movie is one of the most timeless pieces of cinematic fiction ever made, even if some believe it has been tainted by some of the changes that have been made to it over the years. The superb plot, fascinating characters and dazzling universe make such an impression that they continue to stand leagues above hundreds of modern films today."
"There can't be a better start than this for a franchise. It is a legendary movie , A New Hope created and started a culture that we are following since a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"A movie that sparked so many people to be inspired. 
An amazing movie to start a universe loved by millions."
Best Star Wars movie
The best of the best!
"Best order to view the Star Wars movies:

IV: A New Hope (original trilogy)
V: The Empire Strikes Back (original trilogy)
I: The Phantom Menace (prequel trilogy)
II: Attack of the Clones (prequel trilogy)
III: Revenge of the Sith (prequel trilogy)
VI: The Return of the Jedi (original trilogy)
VII: The Force Awakens (sequel trilogy)"
"""Star Wars"" might be flawed but is undoubtedly a classic. The effects were ahead of their time and for the biggest part remain effective to this day (pun intended), whereas the action proves very strong, especially after the comparatively unengaging introductory part. Despite all the bad acting and some shaky dialogues, I found that time really flew while watching this captivating sci-fi action flick, a prototype in its kind."
"the best in the whole saga. full of great characters, great action and great effects"
"Un excelente inicio a lo que después se convertiría en una de las sagas más populares del cine. No desperdicia ningún minuto de la película, esta en constante acción y en un buen ritmo narrativo. 

Los personajes son increíblemente carismáticos, cada actor queda perfecto en su rol (humanos, androides, etc.) , la verdad, muy entrañables e inolvidables. Los efectos especiales son brillantes, cada arma, cada nave cada construcción es muy original; y no solamente eso, sino también los escenarios como la ambientación de los distintos planetas y el de ""la estrella de la Muerte"".

George Lucas deja al descubierto su máximo nivel inventivo en estas películas diseñando, dirigiendo y escribiendo esta historia muy compleja, te intenta meter en la historia frenéticamente, tal vez la primera vez sea complicada; pero luego es algo majestuoso de ver. Posee una icónica banda sonora y mezcla de sonido, que le da el toque de aventura y emoción a la película en cada escena.

STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE (1977) ""Es legendaria, una verdadera odisea, excelente y original historia. A partir de aquí, George Lucas ofrece una de las más fascinantes sagas de ciencia ficción de la historia"""
"When I first saw the movie when I was a kid, I was stunned by its visual effect. Till now, I still see its starship design, its concept as best in the film industry."
"The original Star Wars provides audience with depth-defying action and effects while still managing to perfectly create well acted characters, a brilliant story and a flawless sense of direction"
"What do I have to say, it's Star Wars."
"While George Lucas' original Star Wars movie is certainly a classic, it's slightly rocky script and acting does let it down slightly. However, it cannot be argued that this is one of the most revolutionary - and entertaining - movies of its era: a proper piece of filmography.
Verdict: B+"
The Star Wars saga begins with an absolute classic.
a new kind of movie with not only groundbreaking special effects but a great amount of heart. Star wars changed movies forever with its release. The time of the summer blockbusters started with star wars. Ever since we traveled to a galaxy far far away. Things have never been the same.
"A New Look at A New Hope
	It's not often that a motion picture goes on to shape the culture of a generation, but George Lucas' 1977 Star Wars: A New Hope did just that, not only once but over and over again.  Opening with several paragraph of background information accompanied by an opening theme from a soundtrack so inspiring that it won composer John Williams an Academy Award for Best Original Score Star Wars starts off with a bang. Most movies that require background reading in order to understand what's going on would leave the audience bored out of their minds, but most movies aren't Star Wars. Without seeming derivative Lucas draws inspiration from sources as varied as The Bible and Nazi Germany, and manages to tell a story that although may not be entirely unique is still entirely entertaining nearly forty years after it's original release.

Set ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"", Star Wars  tell the story of young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a somewhat whiny moisture farmer on the backwater desert planet of Tatooine. Dreaming of life outside of the sandbox of a planet on which he was raised, Luke is thrust into conflict of epic proportions when he acquires two new droids, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) who are carrying a secret message from the beautiful Princess Leia to the mysterious wizard Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The message contains details about the Death Star; a ""Technological Terror"" constructed by the evil Galactic Empire with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet, and a plea for Kenobi to join the Rebel Alliance on the planet Alderaan. After his aunt and uncle are killed by Imperial Stormtroopers (Space Nazis anyone?) searching for the droids, Luke has no choice but to join Kenobi in his quest against the Empire. With the help of the charismatic rogue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his furry sidekick Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), the group leaves Tatooine behind to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.

On the way to Alderaan, Obi-Wan begins to teach Luke about the Force (an unseen power that connects all living things) and begins to train him as a Jedi (an extinct order of space monks who use this power to move rocks and fight with laser swords and other stuff that is a lot cooler on the big screen). Unfortunately Skywalker and friends arrive too late to prevent the Empire from using the Death Star and the gang arrives to a field of space debris that used to be Alderaan. From there the gang must work together to free Princess Leia from the Evil Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and Luke's training is brought to an abrupt halt after old Obi Wan falls in battle with Vader. The remaining heroes are forced join what's left of the Rebel Alliance on the moon of Yavin and the conflict comes to a conclusion in one of the most combustive culminations in cinematic history. 

One of Lucas' greatest achievements in this theatrical endeavor is the ability he showed to create what feels like a living, breathing world. From the deserts of Tatooine in Tunisia to the Jungles of Yavin in Guatemala the locations used for filming give life and variety to the universe. Although the movie was filmed on what would be considered a shockingly small budget by today's standards, the sets and costumes feel authentic; at times it is easy to forget that there are real people inside C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca, other times you notice the alien at the Mos Eisley Cantina is really just a man in a werewolf mask you would find around Halloween. 

For the most part the characters in the film are fantastically written and acted. Although Darth Vader is criminally underused, receiving less than 12 minutes of screen time the entire film, when he appears he steals the show. In the opening scene of the movie we see Vader as the biggest and baddest of the bad, he commands the imperial forces and will stop at nothing to accomplish his goals. Everytime he shows up you know something awesome is about to happen, whether it's a demonstrating the power of the Force to a room full of Imperial Officers or fighting Jedi with laser swords, he makes for a terrifying villain. C-3PO and R2-D2 have incredible chemistry on screen together even though only one of them speaks any English, the squeaks and whistles of R2-D2 do a fantastic job of communicating what is going on to the audience. 

When all is said and done, Star Wars is a film that is not only highly entertaining but also deeply moving. Although not all of the effects have not aged gracefully over the past few decades and have been updated by Lucas multiple times for home release, the struggle between good and evil is a story nearly as old as time itself that will always be relevant and can never be outdated. The screenwriting, special effects, and classic characters all serve to present one of the oldest kinds of stories in human culture and does it in a way that remained relevant to audiences nearly 40 years after its original release and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon. If you haven't seen it yet, crawl out from under the rock you call home and watch it now."
"Aunque cuente con varios elementos de la batalla del bien y el mal, con una trama algo básica la película logra una ejecución extraordinaria.
Los efectos son espectaculares para su época, que sigue manteniendo en la actualidad.
la música de Williams como siempre logra un buen trabajo.
Personajes inolvídales y un clímax hermosamente realizado, el inicio de esta trilogía empieza fuerte."
"I know I might sound stupid for this but
I FIND THIS MOVIE HILARIOUS 
I don't know why 
I like the movie but I like it better because I find it funny"
"This movie is simply amazing, the score is legendary as well"
"Although it may sometimes seem a little corny, Star Wars: A New Hope is the movie that kick-started the Star Wars franchise and must be respected in that sense."
Star Wars. Enough said.
Yaaaaaasssss loved every second!
A truly legendary film that captures the magical of space and fantasy like no other. The groundbreaking visual effects laid a confident marker of how the huge Star Wars franchise would develop over many years
"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is iconic to the Science Fiction genre. The visual effects are dazzling for the time period, and the production design is stylish enough to match the space setting, although it slightly mimics the classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The original music score is a vintage powerhouse, but this isn't news to anyone. George Lucas gave us an original idea for a space drama that captivated millions, however, the film does carry a myriad of flaws. Lucas's directing is subpar. There are far too many scenes that feel rushed. With quick, overcrowded sequences just used to add plot points to the story. The majority of the characters carry no substance nor do they off any emotional connection to the viewer. Luke Skywalker is boyish and innocent, but doesn't offer any true character development. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher's weak acting, doesn't resonate with the audience more than just the importance of her role as the leaders of the rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is the shining light performance of the film because of his infectious charisma and charming character that makes him the most like-able on screen. The excellent adventure story still excels with audiences long after its initial release back in 1977. It's understandable and respectable that it's still the highest grossing film of all-time, as long as your merely looking to sit back and be entertained. C+"
"Star wars episode 4-A new hope is a fantastic film that will always be remembered as a classic. Wonderful effects that still look great almost 40 years later,  lovable characters, and exiting action make this a film everyone should see"
"For the 70s, I have to say it's pretty awesome. I'm a huge star wars fan and nothing will ever change that. The storyline of all the movies is easy to follow, and I'm honestly surprised how good this one came out. The actors are great, the scenes and etc are just awesome, nothing else to say."
An excellent start to a terrific story of the Skywalker's. I can only imagine the impact this film had in 1977 when it was released and this is one of the finest sci-fi films I have ever seen.  Alec Guinness was perfectly cast as an elderly Obi- Wan Kenobi as well as Harrison Ford as Han Solo.
Legendary movie with poweful story that you have to watch before you die.
"This revolutionary film has unfortunately been changed and altered in subsequent years and the performances aren't that great, but the visuals and exciting thrills make this the best of the original trilogy. Full review is on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMRQq5p90RE&index=20&list=PLvBOglByjFAMzW8Fy68M-pxM-sR3vR8fg"
My favorite Star Wars movie of all time and the one Star Wars movie I love growing up.
The legend of movies...
Great classic start to one of the greatest trilogies of all time
One of the bests. In both the franchise itself and of all time!
[Despecialized Edition v2.5]
"A groundbreaking and legendary film that is both fun and entertaining beyond belief. The writing is fantastic, the performances have a pulpy undercurrent and the action exhilarating and iconic. An arguably perfect film that captures the feeling of child like wonder and awe unlike any other film."
One of the greatest movies of all time. Greatest film franchise of all time.
The first movie in one of the best movies of all time and ya this one is amazing
"It's not my favorite Star Wars movie, but it was still a classic space adventure"
"A great start, but a perfect sequel. Featuring timeless characters, fascinating lore, and a musical score to die for, ""A New Hope"" is an absolute must watch for any sci-fi fan."
"Unlike anything that came before, Star Wars is epic on every scale; and George Lucas has given us a glimpse of a fully realized universe that leaves its legacy today."
One of the greatest films ever made. Episode IV changed the way we look at film and provided us with the best Good vs Evil Story. Is that enough for you.
The movie that started it all...
"A classic that put the spark to so many generations of future films, not only Star Wars. An entertaining film that goes full speed ahead with it's space fantasy adventure and never hits the breaks."
"When I think of movies that not only shaped the film industry, but shaped the course of history itself, I think of Star Wars. If your movie does all the things that Star Wars has done since the fateful day of May 25 1977, you know you've done a good job.

"A good start for what will be one of the best trilogies of all time, in which the good use of visual effects stands"
BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!
I'd forgotten how good this was!
"For that period it's a masterpiece, even if you're a Star Wars fan, actually in 21st century this may not be the best one but everybody loves it and has a great time of huge fun; maybe you won't understand the first time but according you are seeing the complete saga you will."
"An absolutely epic tale. It's kind of a shame that with all of the sequels and merchandise and such, I think people forget how great this was when it came out in 1977 when it was the only movie of its kind. It was revolutionary!"
"What a phenomenon this franchise became. I love, as do so many others."
"The majority of the cast isn't the greatest at acting, and sometimes the patchiness of Lucas' directing is glaringly obvious. But overall an excellent movie for its time, and needless to say, very influential on its generation and the ones to come after it. P.S. This film makes for a much more enjoyable viewing experience in its original edition than it does the rework."
"The one film that had changed filmmaking forever and revolutionised how special effects are done today, ""Star Wars"" is still one of the greatest films ever made."
"This movie is a lot better when you know what the characters are saying (I used subtitles-for some reason I can't hear television well)! C3PO is so funny! Not as good as the new one in my opinion and the special effects were lacking, as well as one of the scenes, but I did like the bluray picture."
the one that started it all star wars brings up the action and a story of vaders son with lukes sister leis and Chewbacca and han solo this film is like an epic no one hates star wars (maybe some defiantly not me) not just the film but the actors and how they acted greatly plus it made some of these actors famous Harrison ford nobody mark hamil nobody when this came out they were famaus like you see in modern movies 4 1/2 stars 90%
"The original, the classic, the best Star Wars movie ever made. It all begins with A New Hope."
My boyfriend finally made me watch this film that I never intended to see and I have to admit that it wasn't that bad after all.
To those who say The Empire Strikes Back is a better movie I say this is the movie that did the work. This is the movie that created its own universe. This is the movie with the better payoff.
"Although the dialogue can be well bad, some scenes are greatly done with amazing vfx this film is a game changer for cinema with a amazing story line involving a rescue mission, friendship, and with great scenes such as when looks at the suns on Tatooine and you can see he wants to be greater or the bad ass introduction by Han Solo/Harrison Ford and trust me Han shooting first makes it better with amazing visual effects for it's time Star Wars isn't just a movie but a cultural thing with Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Carrie Fisher, and Alec Guinness acting at a high with it being a all around great film."
"An important and revolutionary film. Unforgettable, fun and smart. If you haven't seen this film yet or any other Star Wars film for that matter, then you are doing a complete disservice!"
"A movie that is old but timeless. The special effects at the time were top notch and while old now still have my respect. This was one of the first action movies I've seen and I'm glad of it. While the acting was ok by Mark Hamill but great by Harrison Ford, the story was original and had people asking the question, Are there really giant walking bears in space? That's a good question."
"George Lucas launches arguably the greatest cinematic franchise of all time.  It also went on to become the greatest merchandising franchise of all time and has made George Lucas the richest man in cinematic history.  However, the film does not stand up to the test of time.  After recently re-watching this film, the reaction from my children and I are that it was one hell of a cheesy movie.  Poorly acted overall, including Sir Alec Guiness, it is a surprise that this is still respected today.  However, the special effects at the time must be held in the highest regard for trailblazing the ""space opera"" concept.  Akiro Kurosawa's ""Hidden Fortress"" provided a basis for Lucas' plot development and its main characters clearly parallel R2D2 and C3PO.  

The film is rated highly for its contribution to cinema as the launch of a great franchise rather standing alone as a great movie.  The film is held closely within the hearts of most children of the 60s and 70s like myself."
La mauvaise réalisation de George Lucas m'empêche de donner un « 5 »...

"La primera película de una gran saga de opera galáctica. Esta es una muy buena película, con increíbles efectos para ser una peli de los 70."
Let the force be with you!ð~'
"The original ""Star Wars"" (1977) is a marvel of a film that tells the story of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a little insignificant planet in a galaxy far, far away who finds his call to become a great warrior, a Jedi Knight.

In the Star Wars world, we learn that the galaxy is ruled by the evil Galactic Empire, headed up by a mysterious Emperor Palpatine and whose rule is universally enforced by his henchman Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones). A rebel alliance, led by a Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), is opposing the evil empire, and in this film, she has a mission: to send out a message to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), whom she thinks will be the rebels' ""only hope.""

Part of the fun of the film is seeing how young Luke Skywalker is dragged into all of this, but to be honest, the film does have a bit of a drag to itself in getting us there. 70s films are like Russian novels: they allow themselves the time to establish the world and live in it for a while before we get to the central conflict. ""Star Wars"" is no different. It takes a great deal of time for the robots C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to actually get to Luke Skywalker's home planet, make contact with him, and then make contact with Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The pacing problems with the film make it no less revolutionary. They do, however, make it not the strongest film in the original trilogy, unfortunately, nor the most exciting."
The best film of all time!
Not the best Star Wars movie not a lot of light saber battles. My favorite part is obi-Wan Kenobi vs Darth Vader. Other then that was not a big fan
Game changing for cinema and great thing about it is that it still holds up
"A great movie, a pioneer to the science Fiction, adventure, action, fantasy, and drama genre. I fell in love with Star Wars, when I first saw Episode IV A New Hope, which was 20 years ago, when the first VHS addition of the movies came out, and still loved it as a child even when they came out with the modifications of the movies a year later in 1997. Still a great Star Wars movie to this day, and generations to come. One of George Lucas best work. Highly recommend if never seen or heard of Star Wars."
"A New Hope is not as bad as The Phantom Menaceâ?¦but it's still kind of bad in my opinion. Sorry to all of the original trilogy lovers! Not much happens in this movie so that's the main reason why I don't care for it. As a child, I watched the prequel movies before I watched the original trilogy, so when Obi-Wan Kenobi died, I cried because this amazing, heroic character just sacrifices himself for someone he cares for. And Obi-Wan did train Darth Vader/Anakin (his killer), so that just makes it 10 times more sad. Chewbacca is hilarious and I love him!"
